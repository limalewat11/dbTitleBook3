<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://ebukpdfmobikindele.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>The Spartans</h2><p>The Spartans is a compelling narrative that explores the culture and civilization of the most famous &#34;warrior people&#34;: the Spartans of ancient Greece, by the world&#39;s leading expert in the field. Sparta has often been described as the original Utopia--a remarkably evolved society whose warrior heroes were forbidden any other trade, profession, or business. As a people, the Spartans were the living exemplars of such core values as duty, discipline, the nobility of arms in a cause worth dying for, sacrificing the individual for the greater good of the community (illustrated by their role in the battle of Thermopylae), and the triumph of will over seemingly insuperable obstacles--qualities that today are frequently believed to signify the ultimate heroism. Paul Cartledge is the distinguished scholar and historian who has long been seen as the leading international authority on ancient Sparta. He traces the evolution of Spartan society--the culture and the people, as well as the tremendous influence they had on their world and even ours. He details throughout the narrative the lives of such illustrious and myth-making figures as Lycurgus, King Leonidas, Helen of Troy (and Sparta), and Lysander, and explains how the Spartans, although they placed a high value on masculine ideals, nevertheless allowed women an unusually dominant and powerful role--unlike Athenian culture with which the Spartans are so often compared. In resurrecting the ancient culture and society of the Spartans, Cartledge delves deep into ancient texts and archeological sources and complements his text with illustrations that depict original Spartan artifacts and drawings, as well as examples of representational paintings from the Renaissance onwards--including J.L. David&#39;s famously brooding &#34;Leonidas.&#34; This illuminating volume that ties in with the PBS television series of the same name, airing in the summer of 2003. Booklist called Cartledge&#39;s The Greeks: Crucible of Civilization, a companion to the PBS series, &#34;superb,&#34; while The International History Review called Cartledge&#39;s The Cambridge Illustrated History of Ancient Greece &#34;an original and insightful work.&#34;</p><p>The Spartans were a society of warrior-heroes who were the living exemplars of such core values as duty, discipline, self-sacrifice, and extreme toughness. This book, written by one of the world&#39;s leading experts on Sparta, traces the rise and fall of Spartan society and explores the tremendous influence the Spartans had on their world and even on ours. Paul Cartledge brings to life figures like legendary founding father Lycurgus and King Leonidas, who embodied the heroism so closely identified with this unique culture, and he shows how Spartan women enjoyed an unusually dominant and powerful role in this hyper-masculine society. Based firmly on original sources, The Spartans is the definitive book about one of the most fascinating cultures of ancient Greece.Paul Cartledge is the inaugural A.G. Leventis Professor of Greek Culture in the Faculty of Classics at the University of Cambridge, and a Fellow of Clare College. He is also Hellenic Parliament Global Distinguished Professor in the History and Theory of Democracy at New York University. He written and edited over 20 books, many of which have been translated into foreign languages. He is an honorary citizen of modern Sparta and holds the Gold Cross of the Order of Honor awarded by the President of Greece.</p><h2>The Exiles Return: A Novel</h2><p><p>WITH A FOREWORD BY EDMUND DE WAAL, AUTHOR OF <i>THE HARE WITH AMBER EYES</i><br><i></i><br><i></i>SET IN THE ASHES OF POST&#x2013;SECOND WORLD WAR VIENNA, A POWERFUL, SUBTLE NOVEL OF EXILES RETURNING HOME FIFTEEN YEARS AFTER FLEEING HITLER'S DEADLY REIGN </p><p>Vienna is demolished by war, the city an alien landscape of ruined castles, a fractured ruling class, and people picking up the pieces. Elisabeth de Waal's mesmerizing <i>The Exiles Return</i> is a stunningly vivid postwar story of Austria's fallen aristocrats, unrepentant Nazis, and a culture degraded by violence.</p><p>The novel follows a number of exiles, each returning under very different circumstances, who must come to terms with a city in painful recovery. There is Kuno Adler, a Jewish research scientist, who is tired of his unfulfilling existence in America; Theophil Kanakis, a wealthy Greek businessman, seeking to plunder some of the spoils of war; Marie-Theres, a brooding teenager, sent by her parents in hopes that the change of scene will shake her out of her funk; and Prince "Bimbo" Grein, a handsome young man with a title divested of all its social currency.</p><p>With immaculate precision and sensitivity, de Waal, an exile herself, captures a city rebuilding and relearning its identity, and the people who have to do the same. Mesmerizing and tragic, de Waal has written a masterpiece of European literature, an artifact revealing a moment in our history, clear as a snapshot, but timeless as well.</p></p><p><p>Elisabeth de Waal was born in Vienna in 1899. She studied philosophy, law, and economics at the University of Vienna, and completed her doctorate in 1923. She also wrote poems (often corresponding with Rilke), and was a Rockefeller Foundation fellow at Columbia. She wrote five unpublished novels, two in German and three in English, including <i>The Exiles Return</i> in the late 1950s. She died in 1991.</p>One <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>When the train pulled out of the great echoing hall of Zurich Central Station, gathering speed as it travelled eastwards along the shore of the lake, Professor Adler knew that he had passed the point of no return. He was committed, he was going back. As long as the train had been standing in Zurich he could, he told himself, have got out. There was the platform, just under the window of his sleeping compartment, there was even a porter, looking up expectantly at the two large suitcases and the coat and hat hanging on the brass hook opposite the long, narrow red plush seat. It would have needed only a tiny gesture, or just a smile, and the man would have been with him, hauling down his luggage, speaking to him in the guttural intonation and sing-song inflexion of Swiss-German, which he had not heard for so many years. Adler kept his eyes fixed on his suitcases, and the urge to stretch out his arm was very great. For a few concentrated seconds he was deeply conscious of his freedom of choice. Then, at the instant when the mounting tension became almost unbearable, the train gave a jolt and began to move. He sat down again. He was alone in his compartment, a second-class one designed for two, but the train was not full, and he had had it to himself ever since he had boarded in Paris. It was only a short time ago that long-distance rail services into Central Europe had been re-established and not many people were travelling. <br>Adler sat by the window and looked out at the flat shore of the Zurichsee and then, as this receded, at the meadows dotted with apple trees and the neat farmhouses with gabled roofs, sliding past with increasing speed. The suitcases were still in the rack above his head. His sense of freedom to do as he wished, and the accompanying tightness in his chest, had left him. Instead he felt like an automaton, like a piece of machinery that, a long time ago, had been conditioned to behave in a definite way, to carry out certain instructions, and was now doing so, mechanically, according to plan. At the same time his mind was quite clear and able to reason about it, to maintain that he had all along been, and still was, a free agent. <br>He could, of course, have got out in Zurich. It would have been perfectly plausible for him to have undertaken the long journey from America in order to go there. He could have gone to call on an eminent colleague with whom he had corresponded about their different methods of studying the structure of certain molecules in a type of hormone cell. It would have been quite obvious to everyone concerned that he wished to have a live discussion with Professor Schmidt and to observe his laboratory work at first hand. If his wife happened to have told anyone that he was on his way back to Vienna, it would be clear that she had misunderstood his intentions, or wilfully distorted them. Their closest acquaintances knew that he and Melanie were barely on speaking terms and that she had been bitterly opposed to his going. So, if she had denounced him to her friends for having deserted her &#x2013; crazy, irresponsible, sentimental she had called him &#x2013; and for having set out to go back to that &#x2018;little hole of a country that had turned them out&#x2019;, well, he could say that he had never meant to go there. He had come to Switzerland to see Professor Schmidt. <br>But now Zurich was left behind. He had not got out, so this explanation of his movements had become untenable. Or had it? The Arlberg Express in which he was sitting would not stop again until it reached Buchs, at the frontier. But Buchs was in Switzerland, on this side of the Rhine; here only a little river that formed the actual boundary between Switzerland and Austria. He could get out in Buchs if he wished and wait for the next train back to Zurich. No one would know. And even if they did &#x2013; why would it matter? He had been deep in thought about the chemical structure of certain secretions and had not noticed when they got to Zurich, and all of a sudden he found himself in Buchs. That&#x2019;s what he would say. He was an absent-minded professor, the kind that hunted for his spectacles while they were still on his nose. Then he smiled at himself. He was really being ridiculous! Who was he arguing with, who was he trying to convince? He was not accountable for his actions to anyone, to anyone in the world. Not even to Melanie. Or least of all to Melanie. She had never understood him or made the slightest effort to do so. She had no insight into his feelings, and would not take any notice of them if she had. <br>Since they had been in America, Melanie had made a life of her own, setting herself up as a <i>corseti�re</i> and making a tremendous success of it. Suddenly the rather nondescript, meek-looking little woman who had been his wife had discovered in herself a stupendous ability for business. She had started making foundations to measure, to special order, and women had flocked to her; first to the tiny living room of their little flat in a shabby Upper West Side street, now to her elegant salon in uptown Madison Avenue. He had been very grateful to her at first, she had made it possible for them to make a start in New York; for it had taken a long time before he was earning even a modest salary and had secured an appointment as assistant pathologist in a hospital sponsored by a Jewish foundation. <br>That was a thing that had taken him completely by surprise &#x2013; this virulent anti-Semitism rampant in so many walks of American life, even in academic, even in medical, circles. He had scarcely known it in Vienna. Of course, it had always been endemic there, but in such a mild form that one had almost been able to forget about it, until the threat of Hitler made it loom huge and terrifying. He had not been prepared for it in America, where, although there was no danger of physical extermination, there was an ever-present insidious consciousness of it, like a suppressed toothache which one could never quite forget. But it had no place in politics or in business, and Melanie flourished entirely uninhibited. Gradually she drew her clientele from the more fashionable and, in the end, from the most exclusive society, and treated women whose names were stars in the social register with blatant familiarity. They did not, of course, invite her to dinner, but she got her satisfaction out of them by unashamedly humiliating them in her salon, especially the not-so-young and the not-so-slim who were the majority of her customers. <br>&#x2018;Take off all your clothes, please, Mrs Waterhouse. I can&#x2019;t make you a foundation unless I can see what I&#x2019;ve got to build on. Yes, everything please, the slip and the bra &#x2013; what a dreadful bra! No wonder you look as if you had a bolster on your chest. There! That&#x2019;s better. It&#x2019;s the body itself I have to study.&#x2019; And the poor woman would stand up in her nakedness, shivering in spite of the temperature of the room, which was tropical even in winter, while Melanie walked round her appraisingly, making derogatory comments. &#x2018;Not quite a Venus, are we, Mrs W? But there, we can&#x2019;t all be bathing beauties, not when we&#x2019;re getting on a bit. And we all do, it comes to all of us. Well, that&#x2019;s why you come to me, isn&#x2019;t it? You wouldn&#x2019;t need me if you were trim and slim. You&#x2019;re my bread-and-butter with all your little disfigurations, so it&#x2019;s not for me to find fault with them is it? It&#x2019;s my job to remedy them, that&#x2019;s what is expected of <i>me.</i> And Mr W isn&#x2019;t Adonis either, I don&#x2019;t suppose, so who is <i>he</i> to complain? The left hip is rather thicker than the right, isn&#x2019;t it? And the left breast. But we&#x2019;ll even that out, and smooth away the bulk just above the waist. Now, I&#x2019;ll take the measurements myself, here we are. We don&#x2019;t want any unnecessary prying eyes, do we? And I do all the fitting, my assistants only work on the garment itself. Very well. First fitting a week from today.&#x2019; And then she would quote some astronomical price, and her client would remonstrate: &#x2018;Really, Mrs Adler, I was told you were expensive, but I was given to understand &#x2013;&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;I&#x2019;m sorry, Mrs Waterhouse, but yours is a very difficult case. Of course, if you prefer to abandon the project &#x2013; I never force myself on anyone, even if I have studied my subject.&#x2019; <br>Then, having submitted to the ordeal, the order is given, and three weeks later Mrs Waterhouse is beaming with delight. She feels so comfortable, her couturier congratulates her on her figure, her clothes simply glide onto her and she moves with undreamed-of ease. So the next half-dozen clients are advised to go and see &#x2018;that awful woman&#x2019; who makes such heavenly foundations that it&#x2019;s worth submitting to the worst indignities in order to possess one. <br>This was what Professor Adler was remembering &#x2013; and not the structure of hormone cells &#x2013; when the train began to slow down as it approached Buchs. One day, when she was in a playful mood, Melanie herself had given him this description of a typical interview with one of her most stiff-necked clients. At the time she had told him about it, it had nauseated him: it was not, perhaps, the situation itself, which he might have found comical, but the relish he saw in his wife&#x2019;s face as she described it, which had sickened him. Melanie was making a lot of money and good luck to her &#x2013; if she could command such high prices for the excellence of her products. But in her gloating over the humiliation of her customers she was humiliating him too. A nerve of moral fastidiousness in him revolted against this behaviour, against her very person. He had become aware that the increasing luxury of their surroundings, their furniture, their food, his wife&#x2019;s and his daughters&#x2019; clothes, was being paid for with money thus come by. Certainly, his own contribution to their way of life must have become proportionately ever smaller. <br>For a long time he had hardly noticed anything, wrapped up as he was in his work, unchanging in his personal habits. It was when Melanie had suggested buying an apartment in one of the new luxurious blocks of flats under construction &#x2013; when he, taken by surprise, had in all innocence protested that they surely couldn&#x2019;t afford it &#x2013; that his eyes had been decisively, brutally, opened. His mind flinched from the scene. Melanie had rounded on him with real venom. Of course they could afford it, no thanks to him. She didn&#x2019;t believe he hadn&#x2019;t known how much she was earning. Did he think they had been living these last years on his derisory salary? Had he ever made the slightest effort to get it increased? Perhaps he had, and been ashamed to admit that he had been refused? She must assume that he wasn&#x2019;t worth more. In this country, she had said, a failure is a failure and a success is a success and there&#x2019;s a good reason for both. You&#x2019;ve only yourself to thank or to blame. He could thank his lucky stars that he was her husband and the father of her daughters, or he might still be poring over his notebooks in that evil-smelling tenement where they had started off. <br>That was not true. When he had got his appointment at the hospital, they had moved into a perfectly respectable apartment, small but adequate. In an unfashionable district of course. He didn&#x2019;t care about that, and hadn&#x2019;t thought that she did. Then she had begun to expand her business and her contribution to their income had been very welcome, especially as it helped to educate the little girls. But now? The girls were grown up and sided entirely with their mother. They were smart, business-like, in love with money, and intent on having a good time. They had jobs, they had boyfriends. One worked in a department store, the other for a travel agent. They no longer spoke any German, although he was sure they understood it &#x2013; they could not fail to do so, since he and Melanie still used it at home. He himself, he suspected, had never got rid of his Viennese accent when speaking English, but Melanie had deliberately cultivated an American voice and intonation. By sheer exaggeration she had succeeded in obliterating all vocal trace of her origin, except to the most discerning ear. To this day, he hardly recognised her speaking voice if he heard her on the telephone or in the next room. <br>And yet, when he had told her that he was going back to Austria, she had denounced him as if she were being threatened with the loss of her sole support and protection. There had been scene after scene. Why was he deserting her? Had she not been a good wife to him &#x2013; faithful, loyal and hard-working? What did he reproach her with that he wanted to leave her, to break up their marriage after more than twenty years? <br>At first he had argued that he had no desire to desert her, all he wanted was to go home. Would she not come with him? Or promise to follow him as soon as he had reestablished himself? This suggestion had infuriated her even more. That did not surprise him. <br>Remembering it all as he sat looking out of the window at the meadows and the apple trees and the cows, the neat villages and scattered farmsteads, he admitted that the proposal had been disingenuous. She would never give up the life she had embraced with so much zest, her financial success and her independence. He had not really wanted her to come. She would be miserable if she had to live in Vienna again. He was not sure if he wasn&#x2019;t going to be miserable himself. He couldn&#x2019;t know what it was going to be like, how he was going to fit in. Melanie was sure that he was going to be totally disillusioned. Perhaps she was right. Yet the urge to go had been irresistible, and he had then suggested that she divorce him, and had made this proposal in good faith. But it had made her even more angry, if that were possible, than his offer to take her with him. She had a horror of divorce, the very idea incensed her. It appeared that under all the veneer of her emancipation, in spite of all the examples she saw around her, the old atavistic principles of her faith and tradition remained deeply ingrained. She was his wife. She was not going to be cast off &#x2013; as she felt she would be &#x2013; even if it was she herself who did the casting. And then she had indulged herself in ludicrous accusations. Go then, go if you must, she had shouted at him, and find yourself some silly smirking hussy, younger than I am, prettier than me, the woman who has slaved for years to keep the home together and to bring up your children &#x2013; some soft, sensuous creature to rekindle your waning appetite &#x2013; but I&#x2019;ll make sure you never marry her, not while I&#x2019;m alive you won&#x2019;t, the slut! <br>Well, that was that. It had all been very undignified, sordid, and perfectly ridiculous. The thought of renewing his love life had never entered his mind. <br>The train was slowing down. Professor Adler shook himself out of his obsessive reminiscing and saw once more what was actually before his eyes. Buchs. He went into the corridor and pulled down the window to look out. In the old days the train used to stand here endlessly for customs formalities. He remembered a holiday he had spent with his parents in Lucerne as a small boy. What a long journey it had been, and how bored and impatient he had felt standing in this dull little station, with nothing to look at except the boxes of red geraniums in the stationmaster&#x2019;s windows. He leaned out and craned his neck to see whether there were any there now, but his carriage was standing rather far down the line and dusk was falling. He couldn&#x2019;t make out anything. It did not occur to him that only a short while ago he had been hesitating whether or not to leave the train here before it crossed the frontier. Then, suddenly, before he had had time to remember this, the train moved on. It had stopped for barely five minutes. <br>In a few moments they had crossed the little river and were approaching the mountains. And just as suddenly and unaccountably a wave of some ...</p><h2>Chevys Fresh Mex Cookbook</h2><p>When Chevys-everybody&#39;s favorite Mexican restaurant-first opened in the San Francisco Bay Area in 1986, they pledged that everything would be made fresh from scratch every single day. True to their word, Chevys and Rio Bravo (its cousin in the southwest and southeast) make their salsa hourly from blackened tomatoes and serve their tortillas piping hot less than three minutes after they are made. Now for the first time, Chevys&#39; classic recipes are made available for the home. In this flashy, full-color Fresh Mex primer, you&#39;ll learn how to make fabulous fajitas, smoky salsas, tasty tacos, and more, and serve them up with the same festive flair that is the hallmark of the Chevys.</p><p>Peter Serantoni is the "The Big Enchilada" behind Chevy's and Rio Bravo's Fresh Mex cuisine. Famous for breaking rules and making up new ones, he was born in Italy, raised in Sweden and has cooked his way across America in many of the finest restaurants and hotels. In 1994 Peter joined Chevy's as exective chef and vice president so that he could trade in his toque for a sombrero.<br>Chevys &amp; Rio Bravo FRESH MEX COOKBOOK features the rule-breaking recipes of executive chef and vice president of food and beverage, PETER SERANTONI. Peter is the "big enchilada" behind Fresh Mex--of course, he's a creative Italian chef who was raised in Sweden.Chevys is a vast chain (160 and counting) of Mexican restaurants that has spread across the country from San Francisco (Rio Bravo is a recent affiliate, based in the Southeast). It describes its food as "Fresh Mex," and one of its mottoes is "No Cans in Our Kitchen." This book features a lively design, sort of a scrapbook of photographs and recipes and tips on Post-its, and the text is written in a likable, humorous style. The recipes, from Cracked Crab Enchiladas to Chocolate Tequila Bread Pudding, seem delicious; many of them, however, do have a number of subcomponents, such as chile purees and spice mixes--but that's why they call it "Fresh Mex."

For example, former CIA director Colby and diplomat McCargar maintain that the post-Tet pacification effort (in which Colby was centrally involved) was a great success, that the 1972 Easter Offensive demonstrated that the South Vietnamese could hold their own without U.S. ground support. In staunch defense of Colby's Phoenix program, the book argues for its effectiveness in undermining the Communist infrastructure, claiming that Phoenix's reputation for brutality is undeserved. Fighting the "wrong" kind of war, however, is cited as a mistake, as is U.S. complicity in the '63 coup that overthrew President Ngo Dinh Diem, and Washington's failure to provide aid at a certain juncture in '75. Colby's CIA service, from Saigon station chief to director, provides him with an insider's perspective on the war, a perspective many readers will consider self-serving.

As anyone who watched the televised broadcast of the landing might recall, the astronauts aboard <i>Eagle</i> were guided to their objective by a capable ground crew headed by Chris Kraft, whom his colleagues had long called "Flight." Kraft was unflappable on the surface, but, as he writes in this memoir, the <i>Eagle</i>'s landing had moments of drama that gave him pause, and that few outside NASA knew about--including baleful alarms from the ship's on-board computer that warned of imminent disaster.<p> For Kraft, frightening moments were part of his job as director of Mission Control. He encountered many of them in the early years of the space program, when failures were commonplace and all too often caused not by mechanics but by politics. We learn of many in Kraft's pages. One such failure was the Soviet Union's <i>Sputnik</i> launch, about which Kraft thunders, "We should have beaten them.... We were stopped by anonymous doctors in the civilian world who didn't know what they were talking about, by a bureaucrat in the White House who'd been stung when JFK shot down his position on manned space flight, and by our friend the German rocket scientist, who got cold feet when he should have been bold."</p><p> Plenty of other contemporaries, including John Glenn and Richard Nixon, come in for a scolding in Kraft's fiery account, which offers a rare insider's portrait of the challenging work of astronautics--work that, Kraft writes hopefully, is only beginning. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>After graduating from Virginia Polytechnic Institute with a BS in Aeronautical Engineering, Chris Kraft went on to become the director of the NASA Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas from 1972 to 1982.

Part autobiography and part cookbook, this remarkable work provides a practical introduction to a cuisine Americans have encountered with delight, and a poignant memoir of a time and place in which an average family meal could consist of seven or more dishes, hierarchically served according to gender and family standing (males and grandmas ruled). <p> Beginning with a scene-setting journey to the author's childhood home, the book then provides a detailed account of relevant ingredients, equipment, techniques, and sauces and pastes (many based on soy beans and red pepper). Over 175 recipes follow for a wide range of everyday and special-occasion dishes, from rice and cereal specialties, including an intriguing fried rice with chicken, mushrooms, and kimchi; to fresh salad and vegetable dishes such as Saut�ed Spring Garlic; to barbecued specialties like Fried Beef Ribs; to desserts and confections. A chapter on celebratory dishes, such as the extraordinary, multi-ingredient Celestial Hot Pot, is balanced by a homey section on stews and dishes such as Braised Pork Spareribs. Throughout, Hepinstall offers asides that place the food in its cultural context, variations, and technical information. With an illuminating section on tea and other drinks, the book makes an exciting introduction to a kind of cooking Westerners can now prepare and enjoy at home. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i></p>HI SOO SHIN HEPINSTALL began her serious culinary and cultural research while living in Europe in the 1970s. After attending a summer course at Cordon Bleu Cooking School in Paris, she continued her studies in Seoul, Korea, and Southeast Asia.

Now, with the intellectual curiosity and emotional wisdom that make his columns among the most read in the nation, Brooks turns to the building blocks of human flourishing in a multilayered, profoundly illuminating work grounded in everyday life.<br><br>This is the story of how success happens. It is told through the lives of one composite American couple, Harold and Erica&#x2014;how they grow, push forward, are pulled back, fail, and succeed. Distilling a vast array of information into these two vividly realized characters, Brooks illustrates a fundamental new understanding of human nature. A scientific revolution has occurred&#x2014;we have learned more about the human brain in the last thirty years than we had in the previous three thousand. The unconscious mind, it turns out, is most of the mind&#x2014;not a dark, vestigial place but a creative and enchanted one, where most of the brain&#x2019;s work gets done. This is the realm of emotions, intuitions, biases, longings, genetic predispositions, personality traits, and social norms: the realm where character is formed and where our most important life decisions are made. The natural habitat of<i> The Social Animal.<br>&nbsp;</i><br>Drawing on a wealth of current research from numerous disciplines, Brooks takes Harold and Erica from infancy to school; from the &#x201c;odyssey years&#x201d; that have come to define young adulthood to the high walls of poverty; from the nature of attachment, love, and commitment, to the nature of effective leadership. He reveals the deeply social aspect of our very minds and exposes the bias in modern culture that overemphasizes rationalism, individualism, and IQ. Along the way, he demolishes conventional definitions of success while looking toward a culture based on trust and humility.<br><br><i>The Social Animal</i> is a moving and nuanced intellectual adventure, a story of achievement and a defense of progress. Impossible to put down, it is an essential book for our time, one that will have broad social impact and will change the way we see ourselves and the world.</p><p><strong>Guest Reviewer: Walter Isaacson on <em>The Social Animal</em></strong> <br> <p><em><strong>Walter Isaacson</strong>, the CEO of the Aspen Institute, has been chairman of CNN and the managing editor of </em>Time<em> magazine. He is the author of </em>Benjamin Franklin: An American Life<em> and of </em>Kissinger: A Biography<em>, and the coauthor of </em>The Wise Men: Six Friends and the World They Made<em>. He lives in Washington, D.C., with his wife and daughter.</em></p> <p>David Brooks has written an absolutely fascinating book about how we form our emotions and character. Standing at the intersection of brain science and sociology, and writing with the wry wit of a James Thurber, he explores the unconscious mind and how it shapes the way we eat, love, live, vacation, and relate to other people. In <em>The Social Animal</em>, he makes the recent revolution in neuroscience understandable, and he applies it to those things we have the most trouble knowing how to teach: What is the best way to build true relationships? How do we instill imaginative thinking? How do we develop our moral intuitions and wisdom and character? Brooks has always been a keen observer of the way we live. Now he takes us one layer down, to why we live that way.</p> <p><em>--Walter Isaacson</em> <strong><br></strong></p> <p><strong>An Amazon Interview with David Brooks</strong> <br></p> <p>We talked with David Brooks about, among other things, Jonathan Franzen, Freud, and Brooks's own unfamiliar emotions, just before the publication of <em>The Social Animal</em>. You can read the full interview on Omnivoracious, the Amazon books blog, including this exchange:</p> <p><b>Amazon.com:</b> Speaking of Tolstoy, I bet a lot of people are going to quoting the first line of Anna Karenina to you: "Happy families are all alike. Every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way." Is there a consistency between what makes a family happy, the way that this family turns out to be?</p> <p><b>Brooks:</b> You know, I never bought Tolstoy's line.</p> <p><b>Amazon.com:</b> I didn't either.</p> <p><b>Brooks:</b> I didn't know many happy families that were alike. One of the things you learn is that we're all so much more complex. We all contain multitudes, so someone who might be a bully in one circumstance is incredibly compassionate in other circumstances. We have multiple selves, and the idea that we can have a very simple view of who we are, what our character is, that's actually not right.</p> <p>One of the things all this research shows you is how humble you have to be in the face of the complexity of human nature. We've got a 100 billion neurons in the brain, and it's just phenomenally complicated. You take a little child who says, "I'm a tiger," and pretends to be a tiger. Well that act of imagination--conflating this thing "I" with this thing "tiger"--is phenomenally complicated. No computer could ever do that, but it's happening below the level of awareness. It seems so easy to us. And so one of the things these people learn is they contain these hidden strengths, but at the same time they have to be consciously aware of how modest they can be in understanding themselves and proceed on that basis. </p> <p><strong>A Letter from Author David Brooks</strong> <br></p> <p> </p><table> <tbody> <tr> <td><br> � Josh Haner, <em>The New York Times</em></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> Several years ago I did some reporting on why so many kids drop out of high school, despite all rational incentives. That took me quickly to studies of early childhood and research on brain formation. Once I started poking around that realm, I found that people who study the mind are giving us an entirely new perspective on who we are and what it takes to flourish.<p></p> <p>We&#x2019;re used to a certain story of success, one that emphasizes getting good grades, getting the right job skills and making the right decisions. But these scientists were peering into the innermost mind and shedding light on the process one level down, in the realm of emotions, intuitions, perceptions, genetic dispositions and unconscious longings.</p> <p>I&#x2019;ve spent several years with their work now, and it&#x2019;s changed my perspective on everything. In this book, I try to take their various findings and weave them together into one story.</p> <p>This is not a science book. I don&#x2019;t answer how the brain does things. I try to answer what it all means. I try to explain how these findings about the deepest recesses of our minds should change the way we see ourselves, raise our kids, conduct business, teach, manage our relationships and practice politics. This story is based on scientific research, but it is really about emotion, character, virtue and love. We&#x2019;re not rational animals, or laboring animals; we&#x2019;re social animals. We emerge out of relationships and live to bond with each other and connect to larger ideas.</p> <p></p><b>David Brooks</b> writes an op-ed column for <i>The New York Times</i>.

Stilgoe has developed and practiced the art of exploring the everyday world around us, where so much lies hidden just beneath the surface, offering uncommon knowledge if we but know what to look for. In this remarkable book, Stilgoe inspires us to become explorers on our own&#x2013;on foot or on bicycle&#x2013;and by so doing to reap the benefits of escaping, even temporarily, the traps of our programmed lives.</p><p>"Exploration encourages creativity, serendipity, invention," he writes. And while sharing his insights on how to explore, Stilgoe provides a fascinating pocket history of the American landscape, as striking in its originality as it is revealing. Stilgoe dissects our visual surroundings; his observations will transform the way you see everything. Through his eyes, an abandoned railroad line is redolent of history and future promise; front lawns recall our agrarian past; vacant lots hold cathedrals of potential.</p><p>From the electrical grid overhead to fences, malls, and main streets, Stilgoe offers a fresh understanding of the links and fractures in our society. After reading <i>Outside Lies Magic</i>, your world will never look the same again.</p></p><p>What lies along the highway, just out of sight? How about behind that building? Or under the street? Most of us muse idly about such things as we take our walks or drive our cars, but only a few go further and explore the secret histories of the places where we live. Landscape historian John R. Stilgoe is one of these intrepid explorers; for years he has taught Harvard students to open their senses to the created environment we share, to gently dissect our neighborhoods and public spaces for the knowledge hidden in plain sight. In <i>Outside Lies Magic</i>, he lets us all in on these wonderful secrets.<p> Guiding us on tracks laid by utility and railroad companies, showing us the hidden territory of postal systems, Stilgoe reminds us that important frontiers lie invisible in our backyards and side streets, waiting for our attention. Though more interested in showing us <i>how</i> to see than telling us <i>what</i> there is to see, his descriptions of power-line right-of-ways, alley-side entrances, and hobo jungles provide compelling incentive for the reader to take his advice to heart and start looking around and asking questions of the community. If you think it's important to "think locally," <i>Outside Lies Magic</i> is an outstanding training manual. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p><p><b>John R.

It's an honest recollection of her career and life. She started playing as a teenager and signed with Capitol in 1952. In 1953 she had her first hit with "A Dear John Letter," a duet with Ferlin Husky. At the time, you had to be 21 to tour, so her dad signed a release for Ferlin to be her guardian. She found out that "A Dear John Letter" had topped the Billboard charts from LA to Bakersfield, CA, from Buck Owens. "Buck Owens was in the car with us, and we were going from Bakersfield to LA to cut another session. The guys in the car were betting where the record was going to be on the charts. I didn't know about Billboard when we stopped and picked one up. Buck looked at it and threw it in the back seat to me and said 'How does it feel to have a Number 1 record?" I said, 'Are you kidding me?' It was a thrill - totally unexpected." Shepard worked extra hard to develop her career, as female vocalists were not in vogue, with only Kitty Wells being a dominant force before her. She smiles when she remembers Hank Williams saying to her, 'There ain't many women in country music.' I said 'I know sir, I'm fixin' to change that.' Shepard had 45 hits on the singles chart between 1953 and 1978, including her signature hit, "Second Fiddle To An Old Guitar." from 1964. Her marriages included a tragically short union with Hawkshaw Hawkins who died in a 1963 plane crash, and her 45-year marriage to Benny Birchfield. She also laments that the business is a lot different now than it used to be, and that goes far beyond the music. "We used to have a lot of characters at the Grand Ole Opry - Lonzo &amp; Oscar, Stringbean, Grandpa Jones - they were characters. I miss that camaraderie with those wonderful people. I loved everyone of them."</p><p></p><h2>Travels</h2><p>"Entertaining, and in the best sense of the word, unsettling."<br>THE WASHINGTON POST BOOK WORLD<br>Fueled by a powerful curiosity--and by a need to see and feel and hear, firsthand and close-up--Michael Crichton's travels have carried him into worlds diverse and compelling. This is a record of those travels--an exhilarating quest across the familiar and exotic frontiers of the outer world, a determined odyssey into the unfathomable, spiritual depths of the inner world. It is an adventure of risk and rejuvenation, terror and wonder, as exciting as Michael Crichton's many masterful and widely heralded works of fiction.<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><p>Michael Crichton was born in Chicago in 1942. His novels include&nbsp;<i>Timeline</i>,&nbsp;<i>Jurassic Park</i>, and&nbsp;<i>The Andromeda Strain</i>. He was also the creator of the television series ER. One of the most popular writers in the world, his books have been made into thirteen films, and translated in thirty-six languages. He died in 2008.A Harvard medical-school graduate, inveterate traveler and author of, among other books, The Great Train Robbery (the film version of which he directed), Crichton seeks in immediate experience of new places and cultures to "redefine" himself and uncover the nature of reality. His curiosity and self-deprecating humor animate recitals of adventures tracking animals in Malay jungles, climbing Kilimanjaro and Mayan pyramids in the Yucatan, trekking across a landslide in Pakistan, scuba diving in the Caribbean and New Guinea and amid sharks in Tahiti. This memoir includes essays on his medical training and forays into the psychic, including channeling and exorcism, that have led him to conclude that scientists and mystics share the same basic search for universal truth by different paths. 75,000 first printing; BOMC alternate; Franklin Library First Edition selection. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Christmas In The Country</h2><p>On the 20th anniversary of their first collaboration, Newbery Medalist Cynthia Rylant and Caldecott Honor artist Diane Goode reunite for a story about the joy and warmth of Christmastime.<br><br>Cynthia Rylant returns to her Appalachian roots in this story of a young girl who lives with her grandparents in the country. As in her very first book, WHEN I WAS YOUNG IN THE MOUNTAINS (for which illustrator Diane Goode received a Caldecott Honor), Rylant evokes the warmth of the joyful Christmas season and celebrates the greatest gift of all--the love of family. Diane Goode's cheerful watercolors capture the festivities of the season, from Christmas trees loaded with homemade ornaments to the snow-covered countryside. A warm, evocative portrait of a loving family and a favorite season.</p><p>CYNTHIA RYLANT is the acclaimed author of many beloved books for young people, including the Mr. Putter &amp; Tabby series, the novel Missing May, which received the Newbery Medal, and the Little Whistle series. She lives on an island in Puget Sound, Washington. ARTHUR HOWARD is best known as the illustrator of Cynthia Rylant's Mr. Putter &amp; Tabby series. He is also the illustrator of Kathi Appelt's Bubba and Beau series and has written and illustrated three picture books of his own: Hoodwinked; When I Was Five, an ABA's Pick of the Lists and a Crayola Kids Best Book; and Cosmo Zooms, an IRA-CBC Children's Choice. He lives in New York City.Grade 1-3-Bringing immediacy to a nostalgic story, Rylant describes a snowy Christmas in a rural setting. From the tree ("It was the prettiest thing we had") to the decorations retrieved from the closet ("Each ornament reminded me of my whole life"), this gentle, first-person narrative shimmers with affection. The text is well matched with Goode's humorous pen-and-ink and watercolor pictures. Though the illustrations present an idealized happy, busy, country house with snowy, woodsy exteriors and an integrated church and family groupings, the intensely personal text anchors the presentation and gives it credibility. A selection that holds up and retains interest after repeated readings.-S.

In the thirties and forties, along with Arshile Gorky and Jackson Pollock, he became a key figure in the revolutionary American movement of abstract expressionism. Of all the painters in that group, he worked the longest and was the most prolific, creating powerful, startling images well into the 1980s.<br><br>The first major biography of de Kooning captures both the life and work of this complex, romantic figure in American culture. Ten years in the making, and based on previously unseen letters and documents as well as on hundreds of interviews, this is a fresh, richly detailed, and masterful portrait. The young de Kooning overcame an unstable, impoverished, and often violent early family life to enter the Academie in Rotterdam, where he learned both classic art and guild techniques. Arriving in New York as a stowaway from Holland in 1926, he underwent a long struggle to become a painter and an American, developing a passionate friendship with his fellow immigrant Arshile Gorky, who was both a mentor and an inspiration. During the Depression, de Kooning emerged as a central figure in the bohemian world of downtown New York, surviving by doing commercial work and painting murals for the WPA. His first show at the Egan Gallery in 1948 was a revelation. Soon, the critics Harold Rosenberg and Thomas Hess were championing his work, and de Kooning took his place as the charismatic leader of the New York school&#x2014;just as American art began to dominate the international scene.<br><br>Dashingly handsome and treated like a movie star on the streets of downtown New York, de Kooning had a tumultuous marriage to Elaine de Kooning, herself a fascinating character of the period. At the height of his fame, he spent his days painting powerful abstractions and intense, disturbing pictures of the female figure&#x2014;and his nights living on the edge, drinking, womanizing, and talking at the Cedar bar with such friends as Franz Kline and Frank O&#x2019;Hara. By the 1960s, exhausted by the feverish art world, he retreated to the Springs on Long Island, where he painted an extraordinary series of lush pastorals. In the 1980s, as he slowly declined into what was almost certainly Alzheimer&#x2019;s, he created a vast body of haunting and ethereal late work.<br><br>This is an authoritative and brilliant exploration of the art, life, and world of an American master.</p><p>Gossipier than any tabloid, as scholarly as Vasari, luminously illustrated and illuminating as a lightning bolt, Stevens' and Swan's landmark biography is one of the most stunning art books I've seen in seven years of Amazon.com reviewing--a masterpiece that explains how the Dutchman de Kooning became the master painter of the American century. It's a page-turning tale: raised by a mom who beat him with wooden shoes, de Kooning escaped Rotterdam as a stowaway on a freighter and found a second family in New York's rampageous art bohemia. He subsisted on ketchup and booze, and broke through around 1950 with dazzling abstract expressionist canvases inspired by what was in the air: cubism, surrealism, jazz, and film noir. The careerist thing to do would've been to ride the Ab Ex tsunami, but de Kooning stubbornly defied purist abstraction with the startlingly quasi-figurative Woman paintings. Stevens and Swan artfully show how much went into these notorious works. De Kooning's Woman is "part vamp, part tramp," a Hollywood pinup girl with push-up bazooms, a dirty joke and a scary goddess based on a Mexican deity to whom hearts were sacrificed. She is also part Mom and part Elaine de Kooning, his artist/muse wife, and the numberless women he juggled. <p></p> He called himself a "slipping glimpser," and this book helps us see what he saw. Nobody has ever made de Kooning's slippery meanings and painstaking techniques clearer, in every phase, even the mysterious late paintings evincing the artist's advancing Alzheimer's-like illness. Now I finally get what essentially distinguished de Kooning from his rivalrous pals Gorky and Pollock, and more. I also know what de Kooning was like in bed (loud), how he managed to cheat on five steady lovers at a time(different doorbell codes), why he slept drunk in gutters even after he got rich, and how deeply he loved and how coldly he used women. Stevens and Swan manage to do what no dame ever did: they pin down his oblique soul. <i>--Tim Appelo</i>Mark Stevens is the art critic for <i>New York</i> magazine.

He was an author in tune with the Spirit of God. He doesn't give the reader alot of fluff or opinion but instead he backs up every statement with the Word of God. This book is deep and yet very understandable, it is modern and yet a classic. This book will unveil to you the cross in all its glory and open the veil of the Holiest of Holies unto you. Read it slowly... because this book unveils great understanding of who Jesus is and what he still doing for the believer. He is our Great High Priest!<br><br>This thrilling book is an unveiling of the unveiling Pauline Revelation, and shows what God did in Christ from the incarnation until He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on High. Long hidden truths are revealed which will thrill and astound you. The church has never fully understood the spiritual significance of what happened when Christ died on the cross, was buried and rose again on the third day. All that the average Christian has seen is the physical suffering of Christ. Few realize the deep truths that are given us in the Pauline Revelation. Until God revealed these truths to Paul, no one understood why Christ came... why the death on the cross was necessary... no one knew what happened during those three days that his physical body lay in the tomb before the resurrection. Even the disciples, who had walked with Jesus, did not fully realize who He was, why He came, what He was to suffer and what they were to gain by His suffering. They did not know what happened on the cross, or during the three days and nights before His resurrection, but we must know of these three days, for this is the thing that will build faith into us. These vital truths must be known by every child of God if he or she is to live an overcoming life.<br></p><p>Dr. E. W. Kenyon (1867&#x2014;1948) was born in Saratoga County, New York.

Yet it has always been translated by Westerners who brought their own cultural biases to the work. Now, for the first time, an eminent Chinese scholar has translated the original ideograms of the I Ching into English. Imprisoned and sentenced to death during the Cultural Revolution in 1966, Master Alfred Huang studied the I Ching in secret with some of China's greatest minds. Released in 1979, he emigrated to the United States, where he discovered that no I Ching existed in English that truly understood the Chinese mind. This book is the product of his desire to right that situation. </p><p>To the Chinese, the I Ching is nothing without the Confucian commentaries known as the Ten Wings. Previous editions have given them only a minor place in the book, or have left them out altogether. In this new translation, they are restored to their central importance by Master Huang. </p><p>This book also emphasizes the intricate connections between the 64 possible hexagrams, and introduces several new methods for doing readings. </p></p><p>EASTERN PHILOSOPHY <br> <br>&#x201c;What is constant through this translation is both a sense of tradition and an appreciation of modernity. . . . [It is] a more useful I Ching than older, more self-conscious translations.&#x201d; <br><em>--The Book Reader</em> <br> <br>&#x201c;A careful comparison of Huang&#x2019;s translation with the Wilhelm, Legge, and Blofeld versions reveals its superiority in nearly every respect.&#x201d; <br><em>--Intuition</em> <br> <br>For more than three thousand years the I Ching has been the most important book of divination in the world. Revered by the Chinese as the Classic of Classics and consulted as a source of ancient wisdom, it has been embraced by the West in the last fifty years but has always been translated by Westerners who brought their own cultural biases to the work, distorting or misunderstanding its true meaning. <br> <br>In <em>The Complete I Ching</em> Master Alfred Huang has restored the true essence of the I Ching by emphasizing the unity of Heaven and humanity and the Tao of Change, and, even more important, by including translations of the Ten Wings, the commentaries by Confucius, that are essential to the I Ching&#x2019;s insights. Previous English translations have either given these commentaries a minor place in the book or have left them out altogether. But the Chinese say that the I Ching needs the Ten Wings to fly. Restored to their central place in the book by Master Huang, the I Ching at last flies in English. <br> <br>Other features of this translation are a new emphasis on the intricate web of interrelations among the names and sequence of the sixty-four hexagrams, the preservation of the original poetic style, the introduction of several new methods of divination, and special information on the historical events out of which the I Ching was born. <br> <br>A third-generation master of Wu style Tai Chi Chuan, Chi Kung, and Oriental meditation, MASTER ALFRED HUANG is a professor of Taoist philosophy who studied the I Ching with some of China&#x2019;s greatest minds--only to be imprisoned during the Cultural Revolution in 1966 and sentenced to death. For thirteen years in prison Master Huang meditated on the I Ching and found the strength to survive. Released in 1979 weighing only eighty pounds, he emigrated to the United States. Master Huang is the founder of New Harmony, a nonprofit organization devoted to teaching self-healing, and is the author of <em>The Numerology of the I Ching</em> and <em>Complete Tai-Chi</em>.

Dr. Lynn the veterinarian got the call after supper from a good client. Their four horses had illegally gained entrance to the tack room and eaten 150 pounds of grain.<br><br>She drove out to the magnificently refurbished, snow-covered countryside horse farm of the couple, a pair of upscale twenty-something Internet millionaires. The three crunched their way back to the rustic, unimproved forty-year-old barn where the horses were now in various poses of drooling gastric distress.<br><br>A quick auscultation showed no intestinal movement and membranes the color of strawberry-grape Popsicle tongue. Lynn began her work under the one lightbulb. There was no door, but at -3 degrees, who cares. The Banamine was as thick as Miracle Whip, her stomach hose was as rigid as PVC pipe, and her hand stuck to the stainless steel pump. It was so cold her shadow cracked when she stepped on it.<br><br>She pumped her patients' stomachs with Epsom salts and mineral oil. One of the horses, however, did not respond. She instructed the couple to walk the horses while she went up to the house to call the surgeon at the vet school. (Even her cell phone had frozen and would only dial odd numbers.)<br><br>As she stepped through the back door of the main house, she remembered that the couple had a pair of Akitas named Whiskey and Bear. Surely the dogs aren't loose in the house, Lynn thought, or they would have said something. She dialed the phone on the kitchen wall. As it was ringing, she heard the click-click-click of toenails on the hardwood floor. Around the corner came a massive beast big as a Ford tractor. His sled dog ruff stood straight up on his neck. The curled tail never moved and the gaze was level. "Good dog, Whiskey, good dog . . . I'm just borrowing the phone here. . . ."<br><br>Dogs often remember their vet the way children remember their dentist. Whiskey sniffed Lynn's leg.<br><br>"Good dog . . . oh, yes, I'd like to speak to--YEOW!"<br><br>The au pair staying with the young millionaires heard a screaming clatter. She stepped around the door to be met by Whiskey dragging the good doctor down the hallway by a Carhartt leg, her arms flailing, trailing stethoscope, gloves, stocking cap, syringes, and steamed-up glasses like chum from a trawler. They were stopped when the phone cord came tight.<br><br>"Let the nice vet go, Whiskey," the au pair said in a Scandinavian accent. "She's only trying to help."<br><br>The difference between city and country can be as gray as a country-pop crossover hit or as black and white as five-buckle overshoes versus tasseled loafers.

It appeals to me; breathin' room, big sky. Matter of fact I've seen nuthin' in busy places like south New Jersey, the Appalachian Trail, the Ozarks, the U.P., or outside Gallipolis.

Enraged by a scandal involving a corrupt financier accused of insider trading, demonstrators are rioting outside the Findersbury Private Bank, chanting, marching, and growing violent. But when someone hurls a Molotov cocktail at the bank&#x2019;s front door, killing a homeless man on its steps, Bryant, May, and the rest of the Peculiar Crimes Unit is called in. Is this an act of protest gone terribly wrong? Or a devious, premeditated murder?<br><br> Their investigation heats up when a second victim is reported dead in similar fiery circumstances. May discovers the latest victim has ties to the troubled bank, and Bryant refuses to believe this is mere coincidence. As the riots grow more intense and the body count climbs, Bryant and May hunt for a killer who&#x2019;s adopting incendiary methods of execution, on a snaking trail of clues with roots in London&#x2019;s history of rebellion, anarchy, and harsh justice.

The protracted summer lately over, and the bankers sitting in Threadneedle Street, returned from their villas in Provence and Tuscany. Relentless October weather. As much water in the streets as if the tide had newly swelled from the Thames, and it would not be wonderful to find a whale beached beneath Holborn viaduct, the traffic parting around it like an ocean current. Umbrellas up in the soft grey drizzle, and insurrection in the air.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Riots everywhere. Riots outside the Bank of England and around St Paul&#x2019;s Cathedral. Protestors swelling on Cheapside and Poultry and Lombard Street. Marchers roaring on Cornhill and Eastcheap and Fenchurch Street. Barricades on Cannon Street and across the London Bridge. Police armoured and battened down in black and yellow like phalanxes of tensed wasps. Chants and megaphones and the drone of choppers overhead.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hurled fire, catapulted bricks, shattering glass and the blast of water hoses. It was as if, after a drowsy, sluggish summer, the streets had undergone spontaneous combustion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It had taken just one match to ignite this inferno, going by the name of Mr&nbsp;Dexter Cornell. A gentleman first fattened by fine living, then driven to flesh and bone by fear and failure. A partner in the Findersbury Private Bank of Crutched Friars until he bankrupted it. A banker, then, that bogeyman of the early twenty-first century, a Thug of Threadneedle Street, purportedly the very worst of his kind, for he arrogantly gambled with other people&#x2019;s money and lost. And because his board of elderly directors got wind of his dealings they were able to protect themselves, and so Mr&nbsp;Cornell was parting company with the bank to the grudging approval of both sides, taking away a tidy fortune of several millions and leaving behind the acrid stink of insider trading.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At which point the public, in one of its periodic fits of outrage, discovered his misdeeds and turned against him, and the City of London erupted. Fingers were pointed in the press, questions were asked in the House, but nothing at all was done, and so the populace abandoned its frog-chorus of complaint and got up off its collective arse to make its feelings known by burning down a few buildings and looting some computer showrooms.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As the banners were hoisted the police arrived, barriers were erected and the containment began. The incandescent crowds spilled into the roads like champagne from an uncorked bottle, and the TV pundits immediately started their newsroom analyses. And once more, as had happened so many times in the past, the City of London found itself on fire.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He had been walking in the drizzle all evening.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After slipping off the kerb crossing Farringdon Road, it became obvious that he would not be able to walk much further. By the time he arrived at the hostel behind Clerkenwell Green he was hobbling badly, and his ankle was turning black.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Earlier in the week, a homeless guy he&#x2019;d spoken to a couple of times before had told him that he might find a short-notice bed here, but as the girl behind the scratched Plexiglas counter shield searched her monitor, he knew he would have no luck. She looked harassed and empathetic, as if she was the one who might end up in a shop doorway tonight, not him. She was wearing a pink plastic Hello Kitty brooch on her sweater.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2018;You&#x2019;ve left it a bit too late, love,&#x2019; she said, still searching her spreadsheet. The colour was turned up too high on the monitor, bathing her features in an odd shade of mauve, but as she studied the columns, trying to juggle the spaces in her head, he could tell she was genuinely anxious to help him. &#x2018;We always fill up earlier right after the weekend. There -aren&#x2019;t so many shops open on Sundays so people are forced outside more, and they tend to get worn out just wandering around. The last bed went a few minutes ago.&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2018;Are you sure you&#x2019;ve got nothing?&#x2019; he asked. &#x2018;I was told you usually find extra spaces.&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2018;Was it the one I saw you talking to outside the other night?&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2018;Yeah. I don&#x2019;t know his name.&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2018;Well, he&#x2019;s a bit weird. I&#x2019;ve seen him hanging around here, looking for someone to talk to. You shouldn&#x2019;t trust him. There&#x2019;s a lot of troubled lads like him about. We used to keep two or three beds spare for busy nights, but Health &amp; Safety stopped us. I&#x2019;m really sorry.&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2018;Is there anyplace else around here?&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She sat back from the screen and checked her printed lists. &#x2018;Normally I&#x2019;d say the Barbican or St George&#x2019;s up by Aldgate, but I know they&#x2019;re full tonight because I had to call them earlier.&#x2019; She was new to the job, he could tell. For a moment he actually thought she was about to get upset. He knew he didn&#x2019;t fit the usual profile. &#x2018;Sorry, what are you going to do?&#x2019; she asked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2018;Don&#x2019;t worry, I&#x2019;ll find somewhere to shelter tonight and come back tomorrow.&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2018;Please do.&#x2019; She pulled out a drawer and slipped a card under the Plexiglas. &#x2018;Ask for me, Karin Scott. I&#x2019;m part-time but I&#x2019;ll be on tomorrow night. Okay?&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2018;Thanks, Karin.&#x2019; He didn&#x2019;t volunteer his name.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2018;Tell you what, if you write down your details I&#x2019;ll try to make sure you get a place tomorrow.&#x2019; She pushed another card and a Biro under the window.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t like to give out my details.&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2018;Then how can I save you a bed, love?&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Reluctantly, he scrawled on the back of the card and returned it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2018;Is that all?&#x2019; she said. &#x2018;&#x201c;F. Weeks&#x201d;?&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2018;Well, I&#x2019;m not exactly in a position to pick up my emails,&#x2019; he replied with a touch of bitterness.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2018;Sorry,&#x2019; she said again. Judging by the rate at which she kept apologising, he felt sure she wouldn&#x2019;t last long at the front desk. The first crazy street-lifer who hammered on the counter shield would probably finish her off. &#x2018;Is that F for Frank?&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2018;No,&#x2019; he said. &#x2018;Freddie&#x2014;Freddie Weeks.&#x2019; He limped away before she could detain him any longer. Karin was still in that early stage of her job when she thought she could befriend the homeless people she liked and maybe find some way around the rules to help them, but he knew that she would have to raise a barrier against him sooner or later. Getting involved would mean breaking council rules and losing her job.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The streets were wet and deserted. Tomorrow was Halloween, but it would be happening somewhere else, out in the suburbs, where mothers and fathers were preparing to shepherd their children around the neighbourhood in fancy dress, in imitation of the American custom of trick or treat. It seemed unlikely to take place anywhere around here; there were no children. Clerkenwell was the habitat of the single executive, and no lights showed in the minimalist apartments that had been newly carved from warehouses and factories. There was no-one to whom he could turn, and nowhere he could go.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He was tired of walking around the city, tired of being forced to take a few pence wherever he could in order to survive another night. Passing another restaurant window where slender girls sat sipping white wine beneath coppery lampshades, he could no longer remember his old way of life. What was it like to go out for a drink and not check your change all the time? Friends vanished like dogs before thunderstorms the moment things went wrong and you stopped being flush.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Below and to the East lay the City&#x2019;s financial district. The dense cloud base was the colour of bad milk, but something flickered gold closer to the rooftops. Drawn to the brightness, he limped in its direction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It took him half an hour to reach the source of the light, and what he saw made him forget the pain.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Open fires were glowing and crackling in the middle of the road. A damaged yellow <i>KEEP LEFT</i> bollard drooped like a collapsed cake over a traffic island. The front of a Pret A Manger was boarded up, its walls blackened with soot. In the distance he glimpsed protestors in white plastic masks running and yelling between the buildings, then vanishing within the turbulent movement of the shadows. It was as if the threat of a truly anarchic Halloween had finally been realised. Everyone was on the move. Only the lemon-coloured Hi-Viz jackets of the police remained immobile, evenly spaced across the road, a human ring of steel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Like an avatar in a videogame he was forced from one route to another by the warning signs, the metal barriers, the plastic cordons. He knew that after two weeks on the street, homeless people developed a frayed grey look that repelled the public and attracted police attention, but there was one more thing he had to do.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The filigreed canopies of Leadenhall Market were sectioned off by yellow police tape as if marked for demolition, so he cut down to Fenchurch Street, making his way east until he reached the slender avenue called Crutched Friars. Just ahead, beyond the low-slung railway bridge, was the entrance to the bank. Its wide grey marble doorway, stepped and recessed, was carpeted with flattened cardboard cartons. Pulling a black nylon pod from his backpack, he unfolded a thin sleeping bag and prepared to bed down for the night under London&#x2019;s warrior skies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>2.</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Cocktail</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p>B</p><p>efore the day dawned, the air around the Royal Exchange and the Bank of England still held the acrid tang of burnt varnish, rubber and charcoal, just as it had after the Blitz and the City of London IRA bomb of 1993.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The protestors had been dispersed for now, but the steel police barriers remained in place. The various groups eyed each other from a wary distance. One subset known as Make Capitalism History had attempted to pitch camp in Cannon Street, while members of the official Occupy movement were still amicably negotiating with City of London officers, standing around with cardboard cups of coffee like technicians on a film set. A newer, brasher protest outfit calling itself Break the Banks was attracting a younger membership, thanks to its tactic of planning flash-mob demos via social network sites. A smaller, more violent splinter group, Disobey, hung back in the shadows of the buildings. They had been denied official recognition and were now arguing among themselves about the best way to be effective. Unfortunately, they couldn&#x2019;t agree on who was allowed to speak.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The police had adopted a bait-and-switch approach in their determination to keep all of the demonstrators from returning at the same time, but just after first light the main groups started to drift back into the same areas they had filled the night before. To make matters worse, it was now officially Mischief Night, a time when it was understood&#x2014;at least by civilians&#x2014;that wild spirits would be tolerated and even encouraged. But there was a danger that mere mischief would turn to something nastier and less treatable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Before the rush hour had even started a crowd of several hundred people had formed, and would not be dispersed. Some carried placards bearing photographs of Dexter Cornell, the banker upon whom their hatred had found a focus. The chanting began, and as special interest groups from around Europe (plus a branch from Canada and another from Venezuela) were disgorged from Bank and Monument tube stations to descend upon the Square Mile, the City of London police wearily realised that they were likely to have another grinding day of disobedience on their hands. Every move they made would be recorded, analysed and denigrated by a hostile press, most of whom could see which way the wind was blowing and were taking the side of the aggrieved public. The police hoped the protests had reached their peripeteia, but the demonstrators expected the same thing from an opposite viewpoint, and had the city&#x2019;s turbulent history on their side. Tonight, they felt sure, the time was right for the forces of anarchy to overwhelm those of law and order.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was, everyone agreed, a right bloody mess.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Crutched Friars is a short, narrow road capped by a dark railway bridge at one end. It houses a couple of pubs, a coffee shop and a handful of financial institutions, one of which is the Fin dersbury Private Bank. The bank had been closed over the weekend, so the protestors had not assembled outside it, but as it prepared to open its doors for its final week the mob instinctively made its way over there, on the hunt for Dexter Cornell and his cowardly coconspirators.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One of the protestors was a fake. He had adopted the name of Flannery, and as he prepared to make his move, he knew that he would have to time it just right.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There were no suspended black eyes that he could see, although there had to be some CCTV globes tucked around somewhere, so he stayed in the shadows beneath the railway bridge on Crutched Friars, smoking nervously until it was time to act. The sky was so grey with cloud that it seemed unlikely ever to get light. Thick black smoke unfurled like funeral ribbons above the roof of the nearest building, and he could hear angry shouting in the distance. Moving anxiously from one foot to the other, he waited for the right moment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here came the protestors, pouring into the far end of the street. The police were nowhere to be seen. He darted forward, unzipping his tool bag as he ran. He stayed in the gloom that bordered the edge of the buildings until he reached the entrance of the bank, then lit the bottle and threw it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The glass smashed, but at first he thought the cocktail had failed to ignite. Reaching the protection of the railway arch once more, he looked back and saw a harsh saffron light pulsing out from the doorway. It grew brighter by the second, and covered the entire entrance by the time the first protestors arrived.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Riot police were pouring in from the Armed Response Vehicles parked in Seething Lane, so he dropped back beneath the railway arch and made his way down to the river, loping through the shadows. The first part of his plan was now complete. It was time to start making arrangements for tomorrow, and the day after. By the end of the week, he felt sure, the whole of the City would be engulfed in flames.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>3.</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Pyrophobia</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p>The match sizzled, flared and settled to a soft yellow flame.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was touched to the branches that had been hacked from the surrounding ash trees, and soon the inferno roared and leapt upwards, orange sparks pulsing into the starry black sky. Behind the spitting, crackling forest a man was caged within its wooded heart. He grew increasingly agitated as he failed to find an exit and was seared by the heat. His cries were lost in the growing thunder of consumed branches. As his clothes burned away, his skin blistered in the conflagration until he...</p></p><h2>Vertical Gardening Grow up, Not Out, for More Vegetables and Flowers in Much Less Space</h2><p>Book by Fell, Derek.

Beyond Good and Evil demonstrates that the world is steeped in false piety and infected with a &#39;slave morality&#39;. With wit and subversive energy, Nietzsche demands that the individual impose their own &#39;will to power&#39; upon the world.</p><p>Friedrich Nietzsche was born near Leipzig in 1844. When he was only twenty-four he was appointed to the chair of classical philology at Basel University.

The only problem? The Ministry of Culture must approve the script before they can get rolling. That, and they can&#x2019;t figure out how to turn on the camera.<br><br>Meanwhile, the skeleton of a woman has appeared under the Anusawari Arch in the middle of the night. Siri puts his directorial debut on hold and assists his friend Phosy, the newly promoted Senior Police Inspector, with the ensuing investigation. Though the death of the unknown woman seems to be recent, the flesh on her corpse has been picked off in places as if something&#x2014;or someone&#x2014;has been gnawing on the bones. The plot Siri and his friends uncover involves much more than a single set of skeletal remains.</p><p><b>Colin Cotterill</b> is the author of twelve other books in the Dr. Siri Paiboun series:<i> The Coroner&#x2019;s Lunch</i>,<i> Thirty-Three Teeth</i>,<i> Disco for the Departed</i>, <i>Anarchy and Old Dogs</i>, <i>Curse of the Pogo Stick</i>, <i>The Merry Misogynist</i>, <i>Love Songs from a Shallow Grave</i>, <i>Slash and Burn</i>, <i>The Woman Who Wouldn&#x2019;t Die</i>, <i>Six and a Half Deadly Sins</i>, <i>I Shot the Buddha</i>, and <i>The Rat Catchers&#x2019; Olympics</i>.

She was in a crate. A compact coconut wood coffin with narrow slits for air. She&#x2019;d screamed over and over to no avail. She&#x2019;d tried to make sense of it. She&#x2019;d counted the unblinking eyes. Nineteen of them. One eye too many or one too few, but nineteen by every reckoning. And even though there was no light beneath the thick tarpaulin those eyes glowed deep yellow like dying stars.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When she came around that last time she thought she was still in the nightmare and in a way she was. Her knees were tucked up tightly against her chest and there was no more than a shoebox of space at the foot of the crate, but the creatures&#x2014;the nineteen-eyed creatures&#x2014;had contracted somehow and packed themselves together so closely there would be no contact with her. Not yet. She could feel their hot breaths against her bare toes. She could hear the wheezing in their throats. But they stared at her, unmoving, waiting for her to lose consciousness again because it was inevitable she would. They would bide their time until she had no more fight in her. Then, and only then, they would devour her.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Chapter Two</b><br> <b>The Smugglers</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> Life sped by in Vientiane like a Volkswagen van on blocks. The streets were crusty with red dust, the uneven sidewalks sprouted half-hearted weeds, and the people neither smiled nor raised their voices for fear of drawing attention to themselves. You could never be sure who was listening. They all knew of someone who&#x2019;d fled the country and at least one person who&#x2019;d disappeared. Many had relatives in refugee camps on the Thai side of the border. Many more had ambitions or dreams or plans to join them but lacked the spunk.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This was year five of a socialist experiment that had failed the People&#x2019;s Democratic Republic of Laos in many ways. The Communist vessel was holed and on its way down. The rice collectives program had collapsed. Government workers went unpaid for months. And Thailand had once more closed its Mekhong border due to pissy spats over trespassing and accusations of insurgencies, and, never forget, good old historical animosity. The river guard patrols on both banks had been doubled, but it was a vast river and still the midnight rafts of smuggled Thai goods floated diagonally north on the current, crisscrossing disgruntled Lao heading south on their rubber inner tubes.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So it was a surprise to many on one humid night in August when two elderly Lao gentlemen were spotted paddling their bamboo raft in a northerly direction toward the country everyone wanted to leave. They were dressed in ninja black, but their grumbling and coughing destroyed any pretense of stealth. Between them was a balding cross-eyed hound and a mysterious large object wrapped in a nylon parachute. The latter was roughly the size and shape of a grenade launcher and would certainly have led to the old boys&#x2019; being shot on sight if they were discovered. Smuggling weapons of war was not a wise pastime for men in their seventies.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Did they not teach you to row?&#x201d; asked Dr. Siri, the stockier of the two.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I was a politician,&#x201d; Comrade Civilai replied. &#x201c;They only taught us how to bail.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Then that explains why we&#x2019;re going around in circles,&#x201d; said Siri.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The river ran high and fast at the end of the rains, and the current would have taken them far beyond Vientiane if they didn&#x2019;t lean into it with some enthusiasm. But paddling always appeared easier than it was, especially with a heavy cargo. From somewhere to the north they heard the crack of a river guard&#x2019;s rifle but no accompanying scream. Neither the rifles nor the men who bore them had any accuracy. The old boys were not intimidated by the sound because they knew how little chance there was of being hit.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;And going around in circles would aptly describe the direction of our policies these past five years,&#x201d; said Civilai, mostly to himself.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Save your breath for a final push,&#x201d; said Siri. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s our signal. We don&#x2019;t want to overshoot.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the dense foliage ahead, two lights&#x2014;one white, one red&#x2014;flashed intermittently.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;My heart can&#x2019;t take this,&#x201d; said Comrade Civilai.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Then rest your organs and put your back into it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;All at once they seemed to be surfing the current rather than fighting it. They gathered speed, charging toward the lights. Remarkably, they had timed their trajectory perfectly but not their velocity. Theirs was not a dignified landing. Ugly the dog, sensing danger, abandoned the vessel five meters from the bank and swam home. The corner of the raft snagged in a tree root so the vessel spun around and hit the bank at speed and in reverse. Dr. Siri was thrown to the deck. There was a loud thump when his head hit the bamboo, but his was a hard head. Civilai wasn&#x2019;t so lucky. He was jettisoned head first into the river mud where he sank immediately until only his legs were visible. To his credit he did not kick or wave them pathetically. They merely jutted heavenward like a victory sign. He was rescued by the reception committee. Mr. Geung and Madam Daeng took a leg each and yanked him out of the mire. He emerged with a slurping sound like a large snail being pulled reluctantly from its shell.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Well that all worked out quite well,&#x201d; said Siri.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The next day, Chief Inspector Phosy arrived at Madam Daeng&#x2019;s noodle shop shortly after the morning rush.<br> There were never enough stools to accommodate all the customers who traveled out of their way to eat the best homemade <i>feu </i>noodles in the country. Madam Daeng, never satisfied with shop-bought noodles, had taken to making her own beneath a corrugated tin roof behind the shop. Yet despite all the personal touches and time and effort the woman put into her dishes, and in the face of much criticism from her husband, she refused to increase the prices.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;The poor . . .&#x201d; she would say, &#x201c;. . . have as much right to eat food of quality as do the more advantaged.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the drivers of the black Zil limousines used by the senior Party members had to wait their turn to be served. Their bosses thought they might add a few extra kip as an incentive to jump the queue, but Madam Daeng would have nothing of it. Comrade Civilai often said that hers was the only example of functioning Communism in the republic. She replied that there was nothing political about it. She was just being fair.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Is he in?&#x201d; the chief inspector asked.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam Daeng saw a familiar scowl on his good-looking face. Since his promotion to chief inspector two months earlier, Phosy had discovered a lot to scowl about. Many members of the central committee considered him too young at forty-six to have been handed such responsibility. But Madam Daeng, twenty years his senior, knew there was nobody more qualified or able to take on the role. She left Mr. Geung to clean the noodle tubs and walked slowly over to the policeman.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m very well, thank you, Chief Inspector,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;And you?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam Daeng had been a freedom fighter in the clandestine war against the French imperialists, and she was well aware that she still intimidated even the most confident of men. In fact, her short shock of snow white hair and her piercing hazelnut-colored eyes gave her even more of an advantage. Phosy stood no chance.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Daeng,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It just seems that your husband is intent on making my impossible job even more impossible.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;My goodness, what&#x2019;s he done now?&#x201d; asked Daeng.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She poured the policeman a glass of iced tea and they sat at a table overlooking the river.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighed. &#x201c;You know very well,&#x201d; he said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;What kind of policeman would assume a wife knew every move her husband made?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;One who knew she was an accomplice in a criminal act?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;They drank their sweet tea and watched Ugly the dog at the river&#x2019;s edge catching crabs.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m offended,&#x201d; she said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;You need to work on that inscrutability, Daeng. Not convincing at all.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;And what particular crime am I accused of accomplicing?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll start with smuggling.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Oh, Phosy. Smuggling? Really? Twenty years ago that would have been called foraging. Nothing to eat in the village so you head off into the jungle and return with enough game to feed the family. Laos is being slowly starved to death by the Thai embargos, so it&#x2019;s only natural her inhabitants would forage.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Foraging across a national border is called smuggling,&#x201d; said Phosy. &#x201c;And if Siri had merely been paddling back from Si Chiang Mai with beans and roast pig I wouldn&#x2019;t be here.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Then why are you here?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;We have an eye-witness account of Dr. Siri and Comrade Civilai importing weapons.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She chuckled. &#x201c;And what witness would that eye belong to?&#x201d; she asked.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not at liberty to say.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Of course you are. Until they get around to finishing the constitution we won&#x2019;t have any laws to speak of. Your liberty to say is arbitrary.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Phosy sipped his tea and followed the progress of a cloud. &#x201c;A river guard,&#x201d; he said at last.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;A river guard saw Dr. Siri importing weapons?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Then why didn&#x2019;t he shoot him?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t the river guard shoot Dr. Siri and his accomplices and be done with it?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;It&#x2019;s delicate.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Would it be because the river guards have splendid weapons produced in the Soviet Union but that for the past three months, due to some blip in the paperwork, none of them has been issued with ammunition? That in the event of seeing a suspicious craft on the river, our guards have been instructed to set dry bamboo tubes alight because that explosion makes a similar sound to the firing of a rifle and it may just discourage smugglers? The guards do however have marvelous flashlights and permission to shine the beam on suspicious objects. None so far has been silly enough to do such a thing. Thai smugglers are invariably armed and it would be suicidal. Therefore, no river guard on a cloudy night would have the faintest idea that Dr. Siri&#x2014;if he even were to be on the river&#x2014;might or might not be smuggling.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Phosy put down his glass. &#x201c;He recognized all of you,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;He even identified the dog. He was in a tree not far from your reception committee. He&#x2019;s a regular customer here.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Then he should be ashamed of himself,&#x201d; said Daeng. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s become of loyalty to one&#x2019;s noodle shop?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Daeng . . .&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;We often go for a little paddle and a frolic of a night when it&#x2019;s too hot to sleep. Mistaken identity, no doubt. I&#x2019;ll have a word with him. What&#x2019;s his name?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Daeng.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Yes?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;What was on the raft?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;There. That&#x2019;s the first thing the old Inspector Phosy would have asked. This new chief inspector&#x2019;s already tangled up in words.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;And if I had asked that question sooner I wouldn&#x2019;t have learned what classified information you have regarding our river guards, would I?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Damn, you got me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;So?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;So what?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;So, what was on the raft?&#x201d;</p><h2>Mindfulness: A Practical Guide to Awakening</h2><p><p>The mind contains the seeds of its own awakening&#x2014;seeds that we can cultivate to bring forth the fruits of a life lived consciously.

The captain would be busy, she would be in the way and in any event there was not that much to see. When the <i>Polk</i> skipped dozens of light-years across the local arm of the galaxy, the only way a human would register the fact would be that their view of the stars would change slightly. On the bridge, that view would be through display screens, not windows. Captain Basta had offered the invitation merely as a formality and was sure enough of its rejection that she had already made arrangements for the ambassador and her staff to have a small reception marking the skip in the <i>Polk</i>&#x2019;s tiny and normally unused observation desk, wedged above the cargo hold. <br>Ambassador Bair knew protocol suggested she turn down the invitation, but she didn&#x2019;t care. In her twenty-five years in the Colonial Union diplomatic corps she&#x2019;d never once been on a starship bridge, didn&#x2019;t know when she&#x2019;d be invited to one again, and regardless of protocol, she was of the opinion that if one was going to issue an invitation, one should be prepared to have it accepted. If her negotiations with the Utche went well, and at this point in the game there was no reason to suspect they would not, no one anywhere would care about this single breach of convention. <br>So screw it, she was going to the bridge. <br>If Captain Basta was annoyed by Bair accepting her invitation, she didn&#x2019;t show it. Lieutenant Evans produced the ambassador and her assistant, Brad Roberts, on the bridge five minutes prior to skip; the captain disengaged from her duties and quickly but politely welcomed the pair to the bridge. Formalities fulfilled, she turned her attention back to her pre-skip duties. Lieutenant Evans, knowing his cue, nudged Bair and Roberts into a corner where they could observe without interfering. <br>&#x201c;Do you know how a skip works, Ambassador?&#x201d; Evans asked. For the duration of the mission, Lieutenant Evans was the <i>Polk</i>&#x2019;s protocol officer, acting as a liaison between the diplomatic mission and the ship&#x2019;s crew. <br>&#x201c;My understanding of it is that we are in one place in space, and then the skip drive turns on, and we are magically someplace else,&#x201d; Bair said. <br>Evans smiled. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not magic, it&#x2019;s physics, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Although the high-end sort of physics that looks like magic from the outside. It&#x2019;s to relativistic physics what relativistic physics is to Newtonian physics. So that&#x2019;s two steps beyond everyday human experience.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;So we&#x2019;re not really breaking the laws of physics here,&#x201d; Roberts said. &#x201c;Because every time I think of starships skipping across the galaxy, I imagine Albert Einstein in a policeman&#x2019;s uniform, writing up a ticket.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re not breaking any laws. What we&#x2019;re doing is literally exploiting a loophole,&#x201d; Evans said, and then launched into a longer explanation of the physics behind skipping. Roberts nodded and never took his eyes off of Evans, but he had a small smile on his face that Bair knew was meant for her. It meant that Roberts was aware he was doing one of his primary tasks, which was to draw away from Bair people who wanted to make pointless small talk with her, so she could focus on what she was good at: paying attention to her surroundings. <br>Her surroundings were not in fact all that impressive. The <i>Polk</i> was a frigate&#x2014;Bair was sure Evans would know what type specifically, but she didn&#x2019;t want to train his attention back on her at the moment&#x2014;and its bridge was modest. Two rows of desks with monitors, with a slightly raised platform for the captain or officer of the watch to oversee operations, and two large monitors forward to display information and, when desired, an outside view. At the moment neither display was on; the bridge crew were instead focused on their individual monitors, with Captain Basta and her executive officer walking among them, murmuring. <br>It was about as exciting as watching paint dry. Or more accurately, as exciting as watching a crew of highly trained individuals do an action they have done hundreds of times before without drama or incident. Bair, who by dint of years in the diplomatic corps was aware that trained professionals doing their thing was not usually a gripping spectator sport, was nevertheless vaguely disappointed. Years of dramatic entertainments had prepared her for something more action oriented. She sighed without realizing it. <br>&#x201c;Not what you were expecting, ma&#x2019;am?&#x201d; Evans asked, turning his attention back to the ambassador. <br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know what to expect,&#x201d; Bair said, annoyed with herself at having sighed loudly enough to be heard, but hiding it. &#x201c;The bridge is more quiet than I would have assumed.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;The bridge crew has worked together for a long time,&#x201d; Evans said. &#x201c;And you have to remember that they pass a lot of information internally.&#x201d; Bair looked over to Evans with an arched eyebrow at this; Evans smiled and pointed a finger to his temple. <br> <i>Oh, right,</i> Bair thought. Captain Basta and the rest of the bridge crew were all members of the Colonial Defense Forces. This meant that aside from the obvious distinguishing genetically-engineered characteristics of green skin and a youthful appearance, each of them had a computer called a BrainPal nestled up inside their brains. CDF members could use their BrainPals to talk or share data with one another; they didn&#x2019;t have to use their mouths to do it. The murmuring indicated that they still did, however, at least part of the time. CDF members used to be normal people without green skin or computers in their heads. Old habits died hard. <br>Bair, who had been born on the planet Erie and had spent the last twenty years stationed out of the Colonial Union home planet of Phoenix, had neither green skin nor a computer in her head. But she had spent enough time around CDF members during her diplomatic travels that they no longer seemed particularly notable among the variety of humans she worked with. She sometimes forgot that they were, in fact, a genetically-engineered breed apart. <br>&#x201c;One minute to skip,&#x201d; said the <i>Polk</i>&#x2019;s executive officer. Bair&#x2019;s brain popped up a name: Everett Roman. Aside from Commander Roman&#x2019;s notation of the time, nothing else on the bridge had changed; Bair suspected the announcement was for her and Roberts&#x2019;s benefit. Bair&#x2019;s eyes flicked over to the large monitors to the fore of the room. They were still dark. <br>&#x201c;Commander Roman,&#x201d; Evans said, and then motioned his head toward the monitors when he had gotten the executive officer&#x2019;s attention. The XO nodded. The monitors sprang to life, one with an image of a star field, the other with a simple schematic of the <i>Polk</i>. <br>&#x201c;Thank you, Lieutenant Evans,&#x201d; Bair said, quietly. Evans smiled. <br>Commander Roman counted off the last ten seconds of the skip. Bair trained her eyes on the monitor showing the star field. When Roman counted zero, the stars in the field seemed to shift at random. Bair knew that the stars hadn&#x2019;t actually shifted. These were entirely new stars. The <i>Polk</i> had, without fuss or noise, instantly traveled light-years. <br>Bair blinked, unsatisfied. If you thought about what just happened in terms of what was physically accomplished, it was a staggering event. As a personal human experience, however&nbsp;&#x2026; <br>&#x201c;So that&#x2019;s it?&#x201d; Roberts asked, to no one in particular. <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s it,&#x201d; Evans said. <br>&#x201c;Not very exciting,&#x201d; Roberts said. <br>&#x201c;Not exciting means we did it right,&#x201d; Evans said. <br>&#x201c;Well, where&#x2019;s the fun in that?&#x201d; Roberts joked. <br>&#x201c;Other people can do fun,&#x201d; Evans said. &#x201c;We do precise. We get you where you need to go, on time. Or ahead of time, in this case. We were asked to get you here three days ahead of the Utche arrival. We delivered you three days, six hours early. Here you are, ahead of time twice.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;About that,&#x201d; Bair said. Evans turned his head to the ambassador to give her his full attention. <br>The deck of the bridge leaped up at the trio, with violence. <br>Voices on the bridge suddenly became very loud, detailing damage to the ship. Hull breaches, loss of power, casualties. Something had gone very wrong with the skip. <br>Bair looked up from the deck and saw that the images on the monitors had changed. The schematic of the ship now featured sections blinking in red. The star field had been replaced with a representation of the <i>Polk</i> in three-dimensional space. It was at the center of the representation. At the periphery of the representation was an object, heading toward the <i>Polk</i>. <br>&#x201c;What is that?&#x201d; Bair asked Evans, who was picking himself up off the deck. <br>Evans looked at the screen and was quiet for a second. Bair knew he was accessing his BrainPal for more information. &#x201c;A ship,&#x201d; he said. <br>&#x201c;Is it the Utche?&#x201d; Roberts asked. &#x201c;We can signal them for help.&#x201d; <br>Evans shook his head. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re not the Utche.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Who are they?&#x201d; Bair asked. <br>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Evans said. <br>The monitors chirped, and then there were multiple additional objects on the screen, heading quickly toward the <i>Polk</i>. <br>&#x201c;Oh, God,&#x201d; Bair said, and stood as the bridge crew reported missiles en route. <br>Captain Basta ordered the missiles lanced out of the sky and then turned toward Bair&#x2014;or, more directly, to Evans. &#x201c;Those two,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Escape pod. Now.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Wait&#x2014;,&#x201d; Bair began. <br>&#x201c;No time, Ambassador,&#x201d; Basta said, cutting her off. &#x201c;Too many missiles. My next two minutes are about getting you off the ship alive. Don&#x2019;t waste them.&#x201d; She turned back to her bridge crew, telling them to prep the black box. <br>Evans grabbed Bair. &#x201c;Come on, Ambassador,&#x201d; he said, and pulled her off the bridge, Roberts following. <br>Forty seconds later, Bair and Roberts were shoved by Evans into a cramped box with two small seats. &#x201c;Strap in,&#x201d; Evan said, yelling to make himself heard. He pointed below one of the seats. &#x201c;Emergency rations and hydration there.&#x201d; He pointed below the other. &#x201c;Waste recycler there. You have a week of air. You&#x2019;ll be fine.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;The rest of my team&#x2014;,&#x201d; Bair said again. <br>&#x201c;Is being shoved into escape pods right now,&#x201d; Evans said. &#x201c;The captain will launch a skip drone to let the CDF know what happened. They keep rescue ships at skip distance for things just like this. Don&#x2019;t worry. Now strap in. These things launch rough.&#x201d; He backed out of the pod. <br>&#x201c;Good luck, Evans,&#x201d; Roberts said. Evans grimaced as the pod sealed itself. Five seconds later, the pod punched itself off the <i>Polk</i>. Bair felt as if she had been kicked in the spine and then felt weightless. The pod was too small and basic for artificial gravity. <br>&#x201c;What the hell just happened back there?&#x201d; Roberts said, after a minute. &#x201c;The <i>Polk</i> was hit the instant it skipped.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Someone knew we were on our way,&#x201d; Bair said. <br>&#x201c;This mission was confidential,&#x201d; Roberts said. <br>&#x201c;Use your head, Brad,&#x201d; Bair said, testily. &#x201c;The mission was confidential on our end. It could have leaked. It could have leaked on the Utche side.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You think the Utche set us up?&#x201d; Roberts asked. <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Bair said. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re in the same situation as we are. They need this alliance as much as we do. It doesn&#x2019;t make any sense for them to string the Colonial Union along just to pull a stupid stunt like this. Attacking the <i>Polk</i> doesn&#x2019;t gain them anything. Destroying a CDF ship is a flat-out enemy action.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;The <i>Polk</i> might be able to fight it out,&#x201d; Roberts said. <br>&#x201c;You heard Captain Basta as well as I did,&#x201d; Bair said. &#x201c;Too many missiles. And the <i>Polk</i> is already damaged.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s hope the rest of our people made it to their escape pods, then,&#x201d; Roberts said. <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think they were sent to the other escape pods,&#x201d; Bair said. <br>&#x201c;But Evans said&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Evans said what he needed to shut us up and get us off the <i>Polk,</i>&#x201d; Bair said. <br>Roberts was quiet at this. <br>Several minutes later, he said, &#x201c;If the <i>Polk</i> sent a skip drone, it will need, what, a day to reach skip distance?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Something like that,&#x201d; Bair said. <br>&#x201c;A day for the news to arrive, a few hours to gear up, a few hours after that to find us,&#x201d; Roberts said. &#x201c;So two days in this tin can. Best-case scenario.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; Bair said. <br>&#x201c;And then we&#x2019;ll be debriefed,&#x201d; Roberts said. &#x201c;Not that we can tell them anything about who attacked us or why.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;When they look for us, they&#x2019;ll also be looking for the <i>Polk</i>&#x2019;s black box,&#x201d; Bair said. &#x201c;That will have all the data from the ship right up until the moment it was destroyed. If they were able to identify the attacking ships at any point, it&#x2019;ll be in there.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;If it survived the destruction of the <i>Polk,</i>&#x201d; Roberts said. <br>&#x201c;I heard Captain Basta tell her bridge crew to prep the box,&#x201d; Bair said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m guessing that means that they had time to do whatever they needed to to make sure it survived the ship.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;So you, me and a black box are all that survived the <i>Polk,</i>&#x201d; Roberts said. <br>&#x201c;I think so. Yes,&#x201d; Bair said. <br>&#x201c;Jesus,&#x201d; Roberts said. &#x201c;Has anything like this ever happened to you before?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve had missions go badly before,&#x201d; Bair said, and looked around the confines of the escape pod. &#x201c;But, no. This is a first.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s hope the best-case scenario is what we get here,&#x201d; Roberts said. &#x201c;If it&#x2019;s not, then in about a week things are going to get bad.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;After the fourth day we&#x2019;ll take turns breathing,&#x201d; Bair said. <br>Roberts laughed weakly and then stopped himself. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t want to do that,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Waste of oxygen.&#x201d; <br>Bair began to laugh herself and then was surprised as the air from her lungs rushed the other way, pulled out by the vacuum of space invading the escape pod as it tore apart. Bair had an instant to register the look on her assistant&#x2019;s face before the shrapnel from the explosion that was shredding the escape pod tore into them as well, killing them. She had no final thoughts, other than registering the feel of the air sliding past her lips and the brief, painless <i>pushing</i> feeling the shrapnel made as it went through and then out of her. There was a final, distant sensation of cold, then heat, and then nothing at all. <br>II. <br>Sixty-two light-years away from the <i>Polk,</i> Lieutenant Harry Wilson stood stiffly near the edge of a seaside cliff on the planet Farnut, along with several other members of the Colonial Union diplomatic courier ship <i>Clarke</i>. It was a gorgeous, sunny day, warm without being so hot that the humans would sweat in their formal attire. The Colonial diplomats formed a line; parallel to that line was a line of Farnutian diplomats, their limbs resplendent in formal jewelry. Each human diplomat held a baroquely decorated flagon, filled with water brought specially from the <i>Clarke</i>. At the head of each line was the chief diplomat for each race at the negotiation: Ckar Cnutdin for the Farnutians and Ode Abumwe for the Colonials. Cnutdin was currently at a podium, speaking in the glottal Farnutian language. Ambassador Abumwe, to the side, appeared to listen intently, nodding from time to time. <br>&#x201c;What is he saying?&#x201d; Hart Schmidt, standing next to Wilson, asked, as quietly as possible. <br>&#x201c;Standard boilerplate about friendship between nations and species,&#x201d; Wilson said. As the sole member of the Colonial Defense Forces in the diplomatic mission, he was the only one in the line able to translate Farnutian on the fly, via his BrainPal; the rest of them had relied on translators provided by the Farnutians. The only one of those present at the ceremony was now standing behind Ambassador Abumwe, whisper...</p><h2>The Last Colony</h2><p>Retired from his fighting days, John Perry is now village ombudsman for a human colony on distant Huckleberry.

It's the birthplace of humanity, although at this point not many consider it our "home" planet--Phoenix has had that job since the Colonial Union was created and became the guiding force for expanding and protecting our race in the universe. But you never forget where you come from.&nbsp;Being from Earth in this universe is like being a small-town kid who gets on the bus, goes to the big city and spends his entire afternoon gawking at all the tall buildings. Then he gets mugged for the crime of marveling at this strange new world, which has such things in it, because the things in it don't have much time or sympathy for the new kid in town, and they're happy to kill him for what he's got in his suitcase. The small-town kid learns this fast, because he can't go home again.&nbsp;I spent seventy-five years on Earth, living mostly in the same small Ohio town and sharing most of that life with the same woman. She died and stayed behind. I lived and I left.&nbsp;The next world is metaphorical. The Colonial Defense Forces took me off Earth and kept the parts of me they wanted: my consciousness, and some small part of my DNA. From the latter they built me a new body, which was young and quick and strong and beautiful and only partially human. They stuffed my consciousness inside of it, and gave me not nearly enough time to glory in my second youth. Then they took this beautiful body that was now me and spent the next several years actively trying to get it killed by throwing me at every hostile alien race it could.&nbsp;There were a lot of those. The universe is vast, but the number of worlds suitable for human life is surprisingly small, and as it happens space is filled with numerous other intelligent species who want the same worlds we do. Very few of these species, it seems, are into the concept of sharing; we're certainly not. We all fight, and the worlds we can inhabit swap back and forth between us until one or another gets a grip on it so tight we can't be pried off. Over a couple of centuries, we humans have managed this trick on several dozen worlds, and failed this trick on dozens more. None of this has made us very many friends.&nbsp;I spent six years in this world. I fought and I nearly died, more than once. I had friends, most of whom died but some of whom I saved. I met a woman who was achingly like the one I shared my life with on Earth, but who was nevertheless entirely her own person. I defended the Colonial Union, and in doing so I believed I was keeping humanity alive in the universe.&nbsp;At the end of it the Colonial Defense Forces took the part of me that had always been me and stuffed it into a third and final body. This body was young, but not nearly as quick and strong. It was, after all, only human. But this body would not be asked to fight and die. I missed being as strong as a cartoon superhero. I didn't miss every alien creature I met trying very hard to kill me. It was a fair trade.&nbsp;The next world is likely unknown to you. Stand again on Earth, our old home, where billions still live and dream of the stars. Look up in the sky, at the constellation Lynx, hard by Ursa Major. There's a star there, yellow like our sun, with six major planets. The third one, appropriately enough, is a counterfeit of Earth: 96 percent of its circumference, but with a slightly larger iron core, so it has 101 percent of its mass (you don't notice that 1 percent much). Two moons: one two-thirds the size of Earth's moon, but closer than Luna, so in the sky it takes up the same amount of real estate. The second moon, a captured asteroid, is much smaller and closer in. It's in an unstable orbit; eventually it will tumble and fall into the planet below. Best estimate is this will happen in about a quarter of a million years. The natives are not terribly concerned at the moment.&nbsp;This world was found by humans nearly seventy-five years ago; the Ealan had a colony there but the Colonial Defense Forces corrected that. Then the Ealan, shall we say, checked the math on that equation and it was another couple of years before it was all sorted out. When it was, the Colonial Union opened the world to colonists from Earth, mostly from India. They arrived in waves; the first one after the planet was secured from the Ealan, and the second shortly after the Subcontinental War on Earth, when the Occupation-backed probationary government offered the most notable supporters of the Chowdhury regime the choice of colonization or imprisonment. Most went into exile, taking their families with them. These people didn't so much dream of the stars as had them forced upon them.&nbsp;Given the people who live on the planet, you would think it would have a name that reflects their heritage. You would be wrong. The planet is called Huckleberry, named no doubt by some Twain-loving apparatchik of the Colonial Union. Huckleberry's large moon is Sawyer; the small one is Becky. Its three major continents are Samuel, Langhorne and Clemens; from Clemens there is a long, curling string of volcanic islands known as the Livy Archipelago, set in the Calaveras Ocean. Most of the prominent features were dubbed in various aspects Twainania before the first settlers arrived; they seem to have accepted this with good grace.&nbsp;Stand on this planet with me now. Look up in the sky, in the direction of the constellation Lotus. In it there is a star, yellow like the one this planet circles, around which I was born, two other lives ago. From here it is so far away as to be invisible to the eye, which is often how I feel about the life I lived there.&nbsp;My name is John Perry. I am eighty-eight years old. I have lived on this planet for nearly eight years now. It is my home, which I share with my wife and my adopted daughter. Welcome to Huckleberry. In this story, it's the next world I leave behind. But not the final one.&nbsp;The story of how I left Huckleberry begins--as do all worthy stories--with a goat.&nbsp;Savitri Guntupalli, my assistant, didn't even look up from her book as I came back from lunch. "There's a goat in your office," she said.&nbsp;"Hmmmm," I said. "I thought we'd sprayed for those."&nbsp;This got an upward glance, which counted as a victory as these things go. "It brought the Chengelpet brothers with it," she said.&nbsp;"Crap," I said. The last pair of brothers who fought as much as the Chengelpet brothers were named Cain and Abel, and at least one of them finally took some direct action. "I thought I told you not to let those two in my office when I wasn't around."&nbsp;"You said no such thing," Savitri said.&nbsp;"Let's make it a standing order," I said.&nbsp;"And even if you had," Savitri continued, setting down her book, "this assumes that either Chengelpet would listen to me, which neither would. Aftab stomped through first with the goat and Nissim followed right after. Neither of them so much as looked in my direction."&nbsp;"I don't want to have to deal with the Chengelpets," I said. "I just ate."&nbsp;Savitri reached over to the side of the desk, grabbed her wastebasket and placed it on top of her desk. "By all means, vomit first," she said.&nbsp;I had met Savitri several years before while I was touring the colonies as a representative of the Colonial Defense Forces, talking it up to the various colonies I was sent to. At the stop in the village of New Goa in the Huckleberry colony, Savitri stood up and called me a tool of the imperial and totalitarian regime of the Colonial Union. I liked her immediately. When I mustered out of the CDF, I decided to settle in New Goa. I was offered the position of village ombudsman, which I took, and was surprised on the first day of work to find Savitri there, telling me that she was going to be my assistant whether I liked it or not.&nbsp;"Remind me again why you took this job," I said to Savitri, over the wastebasket.&nbsp;"Sheer perversity," Savitri said. "Are you going to vomit or not?"&nbsp;"I think I'll keep it in," I said. She grabbed the wastebasket and set it in its former position, and then picked up her book to resume reading.&nbsp;I had an idea. "Hey, Savitri," I said. "Want my job?"&nbsp;"Sure," she said, opening her book. "I'll start right after you finish with the Chengelpets."&nbsp;"Thanks," I said.&nbsp;Savitri grunted. She had returned to her literary adventures. I steeled myself and walked through the door of my office.&nbsp;The goat in the middle of the floor was cute. The Chengelpets, sitting in the chairs in front of my desk, were less so.&nbsp;"Aftab," I said, nodding to the older brother. "Nissim," I said, nodding to the younger. "And friend," I said, nodding to the goat. I took a seat. "What can I do for you this afternoon?"&nbsp;"You can give me permission to shoot my brother, Ombudsman Perry," Nissim said.&nbsp;"I'm not sure that's in my job description," I said. "And anyway, it seems a little drastic. Why don't you tell me what's going on."&nbsp;Nissim pointed to his brother. "This bastard has stolen my seed," he said.&nbsp;"Pardon?" I said.&nbsp;"My seed," Nissim said. "Ask him. He cannot deny it."&nbsp;I blinked and turned toward Aftab. "Stealing your brother's seed, then, is it, Aftab?"&nbsp;"You must forgive my brother," Aftab said. "He is prone to hysteria, as you know. What he means to say is that one of his goats wandered from his pasture into mine and impregnated this nanny here, and now he claims that I have stolen his goat's sperm."&nbsp;"It wasn't just any goat," Nissim said. "It was Prabhat, my prizewinner. I stud him out for a very good price, and Aftab didn't want to pay the price. So he stole my seed."&nbsp;"It's Prabhat's seed, you idiot," Aftab said. "And it's not my fault you take such poor care of your fence that your goat was able to get onto my land."&nbsp;"Oh, that's rich," Nissim said. "Ombudsman Perry, I'll have you know that fence wire was cut. Prabhat was tempted onto his land."&nbsp;"You're delusional," Aftab said. "And even if it were true, which it is not, so what? You have your precious Prabhat back."&nbsp;"But now you have this pregnant goat," Nissim said. "A pregnancy that you did not pay for, and which I did not give permission for. It's theft, pure and simple. And more than that, you're trying to ruin me."&nbsp;"What are you talking about?" Aftab said.&nbsp;"You're trying to breed a new stud," Nissim said to me, and pointed at the goat, which was nibbling the back of Aftab's chair. "Don't deny it. This is your best nanny. By breeding it with Prabhat you'll have a buck you can stud out. You're trying to undercut my business. Ask him, Ombudsman Perry. Ask him what his goat is carrying."&nbsp;I looked back to Aftab. "What is your goat carrying, Aftab?"&nbsp;"By sheer coincidence, one of the fetuses is male," Aftab said.&nbsp;"I want it aborted," Nissim said.&nbsp;"It's not your goat," Aftab said.&nbsp;"Then I'll take the kid when it's born," Nissim said. "As payment for the seed you stole."&nbsp;"This again," Aftab said, and looked over to me. "You see what I am dealing with, Ombudsman Perry. He lets his goats run rampant across the countryside, impregnating at will, and then he demands payment for his own shoddy animal husbandry."&nbsp;Nissim bellowed in outrage and began yelling and gesticulating wildly at his brother; Aftab followed suit. The goat came around the desk and eyed me curiously. I reached into my desk and fed the goat a candy I found there. "You and I don't actually need to be here for this," I said to the goat. The goat didn't respond, but I could tell she agreed with me.&nbsp;As originally planned, the village ombudsman's job was supposed to be simple: Whenever the New Goa villagers had a problem with the local or district government, they would come to me, and I could help them run through the red tape and get things done. It was, in fact, just the sort of job you give a war hero who is otherwise useless to the daily life of a largely rural colony; he's got just enough notoriety with the higher-ups that when he shows up on the doorstep, they have to pay attention to him.&nbsp;The thing was that after a couple of months of this, the New Goa villagers started coming to me with their other problems. "Oh, we don't want to bother with the officials," I was told by one of the villagers, after I questioned why I was suddenly the go-to guy for everything from farm equipment advice to frontline marriage counseling. "It's easier and quicker to come to you." Rohit Kulkarni, New Goa's administrator, was delighted with this state of affairs, since I was now handling the problems that used to come to him first. It gave him more time to fish and play dominoes at the tea shop.&nbsp;Most of the time this new and expanded definition of my ombudsman's duties was perfectly fine. It was nice to help people, and it was also nice that people listened to my advice. On the other hand any public servant is likely to tell you that just a few annoying people in their community will take up the vast majority of their time. In New Goa, those roles were occupied by the Chengelpet brothers.&nbsp;No one knew why they hated each other so much. I thought it might be something with their parents, but Bhajan and Niral were lovely people who were just as mystified about it as anyone. Some people just don't get along with some other people, and unfortunately, these two people who did not get along happened to be brothers.&nbsp;It wouldn't have been so bad if in fact they hadn't built farms right next to each other and thus were in each other's faces and business most of the time. At one point early in my tenure I suggested to Aftab, whom I regarded as the slightly more rational Chengelpet, that he might consider checking out a new plot of land that had just been cleared out on the other side of the village, because living away from Nissim might solve the majority of his problems with him. "Oh, he'd like that," Aftab said, in a perfectly reasonable tone of voice. After that I abandoned any hope of rational discourse on the matter and accepted that my karma required me to suffer through the occasional visit from the Outraged Chengelpet Brothers.&nbsp;"All right," I said, quieting the brothers down from their fratriphobic rantings. "Here's what I think. I don't think it really matters how our lady friend the goat got knocked up, so let's not focus on that. But you both agree that it was Nissim's buck that did the deed."&nbsp;Both the Chengelpets nodded; the goat stayed modestly quiet. "Fine. Then the two of you are in business together," I said.

It helped form the distinct character, attitudes, and customs of those who ate it.<br><br> In the 1930s, with the country gripped by the Great Depression and millions of Americans struggling to get by, FDR created the Federal Writers' Project under the New Deal as a make-work program for artists and authors. A number of writers, including Zora Neale Hurston, Eudora Welty, and Nelson Algren, were dispatched all across America to chronicle the eating habits, traditions, and struggles of local people. The project, called "America Eats," was abandoned in the early 1940s because of the World War and never completed.<br><br> <i>The Food of a Younger Land</i> unearths this forgotten literary and historical treasure and brings it to exuberant life. Mark Kurlansky's brilliant book captures these remarkable stories, and combined with authentic recipes, anecdotes, photos, and his own musings and analysis, evokes a bygone era when Americans had never heard of fast food and the grocery superstore was a thing of the future. Kurlansky serves as a guide to this hearty and poignant look at the country's roots.<br><br> From New York automats to Georgia Coca-Cola parties, from Arkansas possum-eating clubs to Puget Sound salmon feasts, from Choctaw funerals to South Carolina barbecues, the WPA writers found Americans in their regional niches and eating an enormous diversity of meals. From Mississippi chittlins to Indiana persimmon puddings, Maine lobsters, and Montana beavertails, they recorded the curiosities, commonalities, and communities of American food.</p><p>Mark Kurlansky is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of many books, including <i>The Food of a Younger Land</i>, <i>Cod: A Biography of the Fish That Changed the World</i>; <i>Salt: A World History</i>; <i>1968: The Year That Rocked the World</i>; and <i>The Big Oyster: History on the Half Shell</i>. He lives in New York City.Prepare yourself to learn that mountain oysters aren&#39;t seafood and that nobody likes lutefisk the first time they try it. This audio documentary about the American cuisine enjoyed during the Great Depression comes from the author&#39;s research into manuscripts written under Roosevelt&#39;s WPA, the Works Project Administration. Narrator Stephen Hoye reads hundreds of recipes, making them more palatable with his nuanced pronunciation of ingredients and lively renditions of cooks describing their preparation of traditional meals. He imitates the African-American speech of the Old South so well that he must occasionally translate his own words into contemporary English. There&#39;s no traditional story, just colors, smells, and flavors transmitted through audio. Listeners can be assured they&#39;ll be hungry during most of the delicious feasts described.

I have the time to write here, and what looks like a good chance to get what I write to where you are, so I am going to try. If I just told everything on a couple of sheets, you would not believe most of it. Hardly any of it, because there are many things that I have trouble with myself. So what I am going to do instead is tell everything. When I have finished, you still may not believe me; but you will know all that I do. In some ways, that is a lot. In others, practically nothing. When I saw you sitting by our fire--my own brother--there on the battlefield ... Never mind. I will get to it. Only I think it may be why I am writing now.Remember the day we drove out to the cabin? Then Geri phoned. You had to go home and did not need a kid around So we said there was no reason for me to go too, I could stay out there and you would come back the next day.We said I would fish.That was it.Only I did not. It did not seem like it was going to be much fun with you gone, but the air was crisp and the leaves were turning, so I went on a hike. Maybe it was a mistake. I went a long way, but I was not lost. Pretty soon I picked up a stick and hiked with it, but it was crooked and not very strong. I did not like it much and decided I would cut a goodone I could keep out at the cabin and use whenever we were there.I saw a tree that was different from all the others. It was not very big, and it had white bark and shiny leaves. It was a spiny orange tree, Ben, but I had never heard of them. Later Bold Berthold told me a lot. It was too big for me to cut the whole thing, but I found a branch that was almost straight. I cut off that and trimmed it and so forth. That may have been the main thing, my main mistake. They are not like other trees. The Mossmen care more about them.I had gone off the path when I saw the spiny orange, and when I got to it I saw it was right at the edge of the woods, and past it were the downs. Some hills were pretty steep, but they were beautiful, smooth and covered with long grass. So I hiked out there with my new stick and climbed three or four hills. It was really nice. I found a little spring at the top of a hill. I had a drink, and sat down--I was pretty tired by then--and carved the stick some, making who-knows-what. Just whittling. After a while I lay down and looked at the clouds. Everybody has seen pictures in clouds, but I saw more that afternoon than I ever have before or since--an old man with a beard that the wind changed into a black dragon, a wonderful horse with a horn on its head, and a beautiful lady who smiled down at me.After that, a flying castle, all spiky like a star because there were towers and turrets coming out of all its sides. I kept telling myself it had to be a cloud, but it did not look like a cloud, Ben. It looked like stone. I got up and chased after it, waiting for the wind to blow it apart, but it never did.Night came. I could not see the castle any longer, and I knew I had to be a long way from our cabin. I started back across the downs, walking fast; but I got to walking down a slope that had no bottom. Somebody grabbed me in thedark, and somebody else caught my ankle when I slapped that hand away. Right then somebody said, "Who comes to Aelfrice!" I still remember that, and for a long, long time after that, that was all I could remember. That and being grabbed by a lot of people.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I woke up in a cave by the sea, where an old lady with too many teeth sat spinning; and when I had pulled myself together and found my stick, I asked where we were, trying to be as polite as I could. "Can you tell me what place this is, ma'am, and how to get to Griffinsford from here?" For some reason I thought Griffinsford was where we lived, Ben, and I still do not remember the real name. Maybe it really is Griffinsford. They are all mixed up.The old lady shook her head."Do you know how I got here?"She laughed, and the wind and the sea were in it; she was the spray, and the waves that broke outside her cave. When I talked to her, I was talking to them. That was how I felt. Does it sound crazy? I had been crazy since I was born, and now I was sane and it felt wonderful. The wind and the waves were sitting in that cave with me twisting thread, and nature was not something outside anymore. She was a big part of it, and I was a little part of it, and I had been gone too long. Later Garsecg said the sea had healed me.I went to the mouth of the cave and waded out until the water came up to my waist; but the only things I could see were cliffs hanging over her cave, deep blue water farther out, gulls, and jagged black rocks like dragons' teeth. The old woman said, "You must wait for the slack of the tide."I came back, sea-wet to my armpits. "Will it be long?""Long enough."After that I just leaned on my stick and watched her spin, trying to figure out what it was that she was turning into string and why it made the noises it did. Sometimes it seemed like there were faces in it and arms and legs coming out of it."You are Able of the High Heart."That got my attention, and I told her my old name.Up to then, she had never looked away from her spinning. "What I say aright, do not you smite," she told me.I said I was sorry."Some loss must be, so this I decree: the lower your lady the higher your love." She stopped spinning to smile at me. I knew she meant it to be friendly, but her teeth were terrible and looked as sharp as razors. She said, "There must be a forfeit for insolence, and since that's how it usually is, that one shouldn't do much harm."That was how I got my name changed.She went back to spinning, but it looked like she was reading her thread. "You shall sink before you rise, and rise before you sink."It scared me, and I asked if I could ask her a question."It had best be, since you ask one. What do you want to know, Able of the High Heart?"There was so much I could not get it out. I said, "Who are you?" instead."Parka.""Are you a fortune-teller?"She smiled again. "Some say so.""How did I get here?"She pointed with the distaff, the thing that held the stuff she was spinning, pointing toward the back of the cave, where it was all black."I don't remember being there," I told her."The recollection has been taken from you."As soon as she said it, I knew it was right. I could remember certain things. I could remember you and the cabin and the clouds, but all that had been a long time ago, and after it there had been a lot I could not remember at all."The Aelf carried you to me.""Who are the Aelf?" I felt I ought to know."Don't you know, Able of the High Heart?"That was the last thing she said for a long while. I sat down to watch, but sometimes I looked at the back of the cave where she said I had come from. When I looked away from her, she got bigger and bigger, so I knew there was something huge behind me. When I turned and looked back at her again, she was not quite as big as I was.That was one thing. The other one was that I knew that when I was little I had known all about the Aelf, and it was all mixed up with somebody else, a little girl who had played with me; and there had been big, big trees, and ferns a lot bigger than we were, and clear springs. And moss. Lots of moss. Soft, green moss like velvet."They have sent you with the tale of their wrongs," Parka said, "and their worship.""Worship?" I was not sure what she meant."Of you."That brought back other things--not things, really, but feelings. I said, "I don't like them," and it was the truth."Plant one seed," she told me.For a long time, I waited for her to say something else, waiting because I did not want to ask her questions. She never did, so I said, "Aren't you going to tell me all those things? The wrongs and the rest of it?""No."I let out my breath. I had been afraid of what I might hear. "That's good.""It is. Some gain there must be, so this I decree: each time you gain your heart's desire, your heart shall reach for something higher."I had the feeling then that if I asked more questions I was not going to like the answers. The sun stretched out his hands into our cave and blessed us both, or that was the way it seemed; then he sank into the sea, and the sea tried to follow him. Pretty soon the place where I had stood when I had waded out was hardly wet at all. "Is this the slack of the tide?" I asked Parka."Wait," she said, and bit her spinning through, wound a piece of it from her bobbin onto her hand, bit it off, and gave it to me, saying, "For your bow.""I don't have a bow."She pointed to my stick, Ben, and I saw it was trying to turn into a bow. There was a bend at the middle; except for that it was completely straight, and because I had whittled on the big end, both ends were smaller than the middle.I thanked her and ran out onto what had turned into a rough beach under the cliff. When I waved good-bye, it seemed like the whole cave was full of white birds, flying and fluttering. She waved back; she looked very small then, like the flame of a candle.South of the cave I found a steep path to the top of the cliffs. At the top there were ruined walls, and the stump of a tower. The stars were out by the time I got there, and it was cold. I hunted around for a sheltered spot and found one; after that, I climbed what was left of the tower.The tower had stood on a rocky island connected to the mainland by a spit of sand and rocks so low it was nearly under the water even at low tide. I must have stared at the waves breaking over it in the starlight for five minutes before I felt sure it was there. It was, and I knew I ought to get offthe island while I still could, and find a place to sleep on shore.I knew it, but I did not do it. For one thing, I was tired already. Not hungry and not particularly thirsty, but so tired that all I really wanted was to lie down somewhere. The other was that I was afraid of what I might find on shore, and what might find me.Besides, I needed to think. There was so much I could not remember, and what I could remember (you, Ben, and the cabin, and the house where we lived, and those pictures you have of Mom and Dad) was a long, long time ago. I wanted to try to remember more, and I wanted to think about what Parka had said and what it might mean.So I went back to the sheltered place I had found among the blue stones and lay down. I was barefoot, and it seemed to me while I lay there that I should have had hiking boots, and stockings. I could not remember what had become of them. I was wearing a gray wool shirt without buttons and gray wool pants with no pockets, and that did not seem right either. I had a belt, and a little leather pouch hanging from it by its strings; but the only things in it were Parka's bowstring, three hard black seeds, and a little knife with a wooden handle and a wooden scabbard. The knife fit my hand like it belonged there, but I did not remember it at all.Copyright � 2004 by Gene Wolfe</p><h2>The Life and Times of Warner Glenn</h2><p>This is a biography of one of the Wests most iconic individuals: Warner Glenn is a descendant of pioneers, a successful cattle rancher, and world-renowned lion hunter.

He did not like<br>the office within the building. And he most certainly <br>did not like that he was being kept waiting in the office within the<br>building.<br><br>Luddig was a first-tier ambassador in the Drazi diplomatic corps, and he<br>had fought long and hard to get to where he was. As he drummed his fingers<br>impatiently on the expansive desk he was sitting beside, he couldn't help<br>but wonder why it was that things never quite seemed to work out the way<br>that he wanted them to.<br><br>Seated next to Luddig was his immediate aide, Vidkun. They provided quite<br>a contrast to one another, Luddig being somewhat heavyset and jowly while<br>Vidkun was small and slim. Not that Vidkun was a weakling by any means. He<br>was whipcord thin and had a certain air of quiet strength about him.<br>Luddig, on the other hand, was like a perpetually seething volcano that<br>tended to overwhelm any who stood before him with belligerence and<br>bombast. As diplomats went, he wasn't particularly genteel. Then again,<br>he'd never had to be. His activities were confined mostly to his office<br>and occasional backdoor maneuvers.<br><br>It was one of those activities that had brought him here, to Centauri<br>Prime, to the place called the "Tower of Power." It was an impressive and<br>elegantly simple structure that, when viewed from the ground, seemed to<br>stretch forever to the sky.<br><br>Luddig had not come here on his own, of course. It had been set up<br>meticulously and scrupulously in advance. No one on <br>the Drazi Homeworld had been aware that he was coming to Centauri Prime .<br>. . well, not "officially" aware. He had brought Vidkun along primarily to<br>have someone to complain to.<br><br>"This is how they treat Luddig of the Drazi!" Luddig said in disgust. He<br>was one of those who chose to affect the popular Drazi habit of referring<br>to himself in the third person. "An hour and a half we wait," he<br>continued. "Waiting and waiting in this stupid room for this stupid<br>minister." He cuffed Vidkun abruptly on the shoulder. Vidkun barely<br>reacted. By this point in his career, he scarcely seemed to notice. "We<br>had a deal!"<br><br>"Perhaps you should remind him of that, sir," Vidkun said with exaggerated<br>politeness.<br><br>"Remind him! Of course Luddig will remind him! Drazi do not have to,<br>should not have to, tolerate such poor attention to Drazi interests!"<br><br>"Of course not, sir."<br><br>"Stop agreeing!" Luddig said in annoyance, striking Vidkun once more on<br>the shoulder. Since it was the exact same place, it left Vidkun a bit<br>sore, but stoutly he said nothing. "You keep agreeing. It shows you are<br>trying to mock Luddig!"<br><br>Vidkun tried to figure out if there was any conceivable way in which he<br>could respond to the accusation. If he said it wasn't true, then he'd be<br>disagreeing and thereby disproving the contention. Except he'd be calling<br>Luddig a liar. If he agreed that was what he was doing, Luddig would shout<br>at him that he was doing it again. Vidkun wisely chose to say nothing at<br>all, instead inclining his head slightly in acknowledgment without<br>actually providing any admission one way or the other.<br><br>Clearly Luddig was about to press the matter when, with miraculously good<br>timing, Minister Castig Lione entered.<br><br>Lione was a tall man whose build and general look bordered on the<br>cadaverous. He had such gravity about him that he could have used it to<br>maintain a satellite in orbit, Vidkun mused. Then he noticed several of<br>the black-clad youths known as the Prime Candidates following Lione,<br>dropping back and away from the minister as he walked into his office.<br>Vidkun came to the conclusion that Lione already did have satellites. They<br>were the youth of Centauri Prime, and as near as Vidkun could tell, the<br>best and the brightest. Their loyalty to Castig Lione was reputedly<br>unyielding and unwavering. If Lione had told them to break every bone in<br>their bodies, they would do so and do it willingly.<br><br>Vidkun did not, as a rule, like fanatics. If nothing else, they tended to<br>be a bit too loud for his taste.<br><br>"Ambassador Luddig," said Lione, bowing deeply in respect. For a man of<br>his height, bowing was no easy thing. Luddig should have appreciated the<br>gesture. Instead he scowled even more fiercely. Vidkun rose and returned<br>the bow, and got another quick physical rebuke from his superior. "To<br>what," continued Lione, "do I owe this honor?"<br><br>"This honor." Luddig made an incredulous noise that conveyed contempt.<br>"This honor. This treatment is more like."<br><br>"Treatment?" His eyebrows puckered in confusion. "Was there a problem with<br>your arrival? My Prime Candidates were given specific instructions to<br>provide you full protection in escorting you from the port. I cannot, of<br>course, account for the reactions your presence might engender among our<br>populace."<br><br>"It has nothing to do with that--"<br><br>Lione continued as if Luddig had not spoken. "In case you are unaware, all<br>foreigners have been banned from the surface of Centauri Prime. That is<br>how highly charged sentiments have been running. Fortunately, as a<br>minister, I have certain . . . latitude. So I was able to arrange for your<br>visit to our fair--"<br><br>"It has nothing to do with that!"<br><br>Lione blinked owlishly. "Then I am not quite sure what you are referring<br>to."<br><br>"We had an arrangement!"<br><br>"Did we?"<br><br>"About Mipas!"<br><br>"Ah." Lione did an exceptional job of acting as if he had been unaware of<br>what was getting Luddig so agitated. "You're speak-<br>ing about the unfortunate, but necessary, attack on Mipas."<br><br>"Unfortunate but necessary how! Unfortunate, yes! Necessary . . . Drazi do<br>not see that! Has Centauri Prime totally taken leave of senses? Or has<br>Centauri Prime forgotten that Mipas is under Drazi jurisdiction!"<br><br>"Jurisdiction, yes. Curious how that happened, isn't it." Lione's calm,<br>even lazy tone suddenly shifted. "Curious that the Drazi government paid<br>so little attention to Mipas . . . until valuable minerals were found on<br>it. Suddenly a world that was just beyond the outermost edge of the Drazi<br>borders became Drazi property . . . when your government reconfigured the<br>borders <br>to allow for . . ." Lione actually chuckled, and it was not the most<br>pleasant of sounds. ". . . to allow for the expanding universe theory. 'If<br>the universe is expanding, Drazi territory must <br>expand with it to keep up with natural law.' That was priceless, <br>I have to admit. No one in the Alliance gainsayed you, simply because they<br>were stunned by the sheer gall your people <br>displayed."<br><br>"If Centauri Prime has issue with expansion of--"<br><br>Lione held up a hand, stilling the new torrent of words. "The Centaurum<br>has no such issues. Expand territories all you wish. Reconfigure your<br>borders and decide that you're entitled to take possession of the Vorlon<br>Homeworld, for all we care. But Mipas, well . . ." and he shook his head<br>sadly. "The fact is that our intelligence informed us that Mipas was<br>acting in concert with, and providing aid to, certain insurrectionist<br>factions here on Centauri Prime."<br><br>"Is lie!"<br><br>"Is not," Lione responded coolly. "The information we have received is<br>quite definitive. Mipas was aiding those who would overthrow our beloved<br>emperor and drive our prime minister out of office. Naturally, out of a<br>sense of self-preservation, we had to take action."<br><br>Between gritted teeth, Luddig said, "We had an understanding."<br><br>"Did we?"<br><br>"Do not play games with Drazi!" Luddig warned. "Centauri Prime is as<br>interested in mineral deposits on Mipas as Drazi! <br>I know that! You know that! Everyone know that! We had arrangements!"<br><br>"And how much you must have enjoyed those arrangements, Luddig," said<br>Lione. "Under-the-table payments made to you by certain Mipas officials.<br>And you, in turn, pass those payments along to us. A token of respect; a<br>tithe, if you will, to purchase our goodwill. And you succeeded for quite<br>some time, Luddig. I commend you for your industry. And I commend you for<br>the deftness with which you managed to cut yourself in to those payments.<br>How much did you manage to keep for yourself? Ten percent? Twenty?"<br><br>"Do you think Drazi not take risks!" Luddig said hotly. "Luddig of Drazi<br>has his own expenses, own concerns.

Then the Feds announce a full-out investigation into local police corruption, and everything goes haywire.<br><br>Klein's been hung out as bait, "a bad cop to draw the heat," and the heat's coming from all sides: from local politicians, from LAPD brass, from racketeers and drug kingpins--all of them hell-bent on keeping their own secrets hidden.

A. Salvatore. <br><br><i>The Legacy of the Drow Collector's Edition</i> brings together four bestselling novels: <i>The Legacy, Starless Night, Siege of Darkness, </i>and <i>Passage to Dawn</i>. The adventure begins in seeming serenity as we find Drizzt Do'Urden enjoying a rare state of peace. But he did not arrive at this station without leaving powerful enemies in his wake. Lolth, the dreaded Spider Queen deity of the evil Dark Elves, counts herself among these enemies and has vowed to end the drow's idyllic days. Thus begins a severe and lasting chain of events that make these collected <b>Forgotten Realms</b> novels unforgettable reads.<br></p><p>Think of it as an opportunity to give all those tattered old paperbacks away to younger adventurers. Just as Wizards of the Coast did with the Icewind Dale and Dark Elf trilogy hardbacks, this 1,000-plus page collector's edition pulls together some of Drizzt Do'Urden's best stories--<i>Legacy</i>, <i>Starless Night</i>, <i>Siege of Darkness</i>, and <i>Passage to Dawn</i>--into one whopping volume.<p> Starting way back with 1988's <i>Crystal Shard</i>, the Icewind Dale books kicked off the celebrated Drizzt saga, while the Dark Elf prequel trio that followed detailed the scimitar swinger's shadowy beginnings in the drow city of Menzoberranzan. This third series essentially rolls up a bunch of random encounters from both worlds--all of Drizzt's cherished friends and newfound foes on the surface world, along with his old adversaries from the Underdark--throwing them into combat after combat to see who shakes out.</p><p> <i>Legacy</i> begins amicably enough, with Bruenor back on the throne and Cattie-brie and Wulfgar getting ready to tie the knot. But along comes a spider (the demon queen Lloth, in this case), and pretty soon the tunnels below Mithril Hall become a bloodbath. <i>Starless Night</i> takes Drizzt deeper into the Underdark in search of his lost friends, to Blingdenstone and on towards Menzoberranzan. Then <i>Siege of Darkness</i> nearly closes the series with its giant drow-dwarf battle finale, but the sea-faring followup adventure <i>Passage to Dawn</i> reveals the fate of one of Drizzt's fallen comrades, held in the Abyss by the demon Errtu. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p><b>R.A.

The mass media was abuzz about the inflation jumping above 100 percent, annually. Federal debt obligations had reached absurd numbers, the stock markets had reached dizzying heights, and there were rumblings about foreign repudiations of U.S. Treasury paper.</p><p>As he drove toward a routine security paperwork inspection with a defense contractor, Phil Adams had his attention glued to the car radio. He punched the radio&#x2019;s scan button often, jumping from news report to news report. The stories that he heard this morning were the worst yet: rioting in Detroit and Cleveland and rumors of mass demonstrations being planned by &#x201c;community activists&#x201d; in many other major cities. Phil muttered to himself, &#x201c;This is starting to damage my calm.&#x201d;</p><p>Then Phil got a call on his cell phone from his manager, Hal Jensen.</p><p>&#x201c;I need you to either get back to the Section office or get to a STU phone, pronto!&#x201d; Hal said.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m on my way to Peregrine Systems for a quarterly,&#x201d; Phil answered. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just a two-minute drive from there. They&#x2019;ve got a secure phone. I&#x2019;ll call you in five mikes or less.&#x201d;</p><p>Just three minutes later, Phil called Hal on the secure line. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s so urgent?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I just got a priority tasking via the high side. We&#x2019;ve been ordered to fully update and upload all of our electronic holdings, clean our Section out of the SCIF, degauss and destroy all of the Tall Oak local classified holdings, and turn over the entire SCIF to the FEMA staff. I&#x2019;ve also been directed to close out all employment contracts&#x2014;both full-timers and the ad hocs.&#x201d;</p><p>Phil was stunned. After a long pause, he replied, &#x201c;Okay, I&#x2019;ll make some excuses here and be back at the office ASAP.&#x201d;</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>Phil drove back to JBLM&#x2014;still listening to the bad economic news on the radio. Phil was thirty-two years old, of average height, with a handsome face, brown hair, blue eyes, and short-cropped hair that was turning prematurely gray. The gray hair was an advantage on post, where everyone seeing him in civilian clothes assumed that he was either a field-grade officer or a senior NCO who was off duty. Even though he wasn&#x2019;t tall, soldiers had a tendency to step out of the way when he walked down the hall. His physical bearing triggered immediate respect.</p><p>As he walked into the Tall Oak Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF), he could immediately feel the tension.</p><p>Hal spelled it out tersely: The economic collapse had forced a drastic cutback in federal programs. For the first time ever, intelligence agencies had their budgets axed, and the deepest of those cuts were made to agencies with contractors. They were to destroy all of their holdings and shut down the Section. Their communications equipment would all be handed over to the FEMA staff. However, three of their computers designed specifically for handling SCI traffic would be useless to the FEMA staffers without their removable hard drives. But that was of little concern to the departing Tall Oakers.</p><p>Tall Oak had one locked storage cage in the far end of the building that was used to hold their Field SCIF gear. This cage contained some dusty equipment in plain view: two pallets of coiled concertina barbed wire, three folding tables, a half dozen folding chairs, a bundled GP small tent, two sledgehammers, a shovel, a four-wheeled utility cart, a two-wheeled dolly, and a tall stack of galvanized forty-gallon steel trash barrels that could be used as burn barrels. None of this gear had been used in recent memory, and the only time that Phil ever saw it was when he was escorting visiting inspectors. In the context of their work, the Field SCIF gear was essentially a collection of relics and an administrative nuisance&#x2014;just a few more items to count each time that they had to do a PBO inventory.</p><p>Fortunately, with digitization, the volume of hard-copy classified material that DCS Task Group Tall Oak stored had decreased in recent years. Most of their holdings were in the form of magnetic media that could be destroyed by degaussing them&#x2014;passing them through an intense magnetic field. But the task of destroying all of the paper documents would still be enormous.</p><p>Since the SCIF had only three crosscut paper shredders, Jensen decided to set up a temporary Field SCIF in the motor pool area behind the building to burn most of the documents. Stringing the three strands of concertina wire went quickly. They didn&#x2019;t bother staking it down. Inside the concertina wire enclosure, eight burn barrels were set up in a semicircle. Green plastic Scepter cans of diesel fuel were hauled out and used to stoke the barrels since documents stacked more than five pages thick did not burn well, just by themselves. There were also fire extinguishers nearby, if needed.</p><p>Many cartloads of documents were wheeled out of the SCIF and down the hall to the burn barrels. The flames were a hazard (since the barrels had to be stirred regularly with a length of pipe), and the smoke was irritating. Intermittent rain showers made the work miserable as wet ashes began to cling to every surface.</p><p>As they worked, Phil&#x2019;s coworker Clarence Tang listened with earbuds to news reports on a compact FM jogging radio, which he had strapped around his upper arm. He relayed the news headlines tersely and sporadically, half shouting, &#x201c;There are still riots in progress in New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Dallas, and Los Angeles. Now in California there are also riots and looting in Oakland, Stockton, and San Francisco. So far there is just sporadic looting in Portland and downtown Seattle. They say that Vancouver, BC, seems almost normal, except for a couple of protests by &#x2018;the usual activists.&#x2019; They&#x2019;re describing the freeway traffic like it&#x2019;s rush hour, but at midday. Seattle traffic is definitely slowing down, and they may be closing Sea-Tac airport since there are riots in so many destination cities. Seems like most metro areas with populations over a half million are in trouble. Part of Miami is in flames, out of control.&#x201d;</p><p>Phil discovered that the reinforced concertina wire&#x2013;handling gloves worked well at protecting his hands when he stirred the drums of burning documents. Meanwhile, inside the SCIF the bulk degaussers were kept humming, demagnetizing various media. The various &#x201c;wiped&#x201d; removable hard disks, disk drives, and tape cartridges were then carried out and smashed with sledgehammers, and then burned for good measure. Hal even had them burn the stacks of generic classified document cover sheets, even though they themselves were not classified. (Jensen always held a &#x201c;belt and suspenders&#x201d; attitude about some things.)</p><p>Next, they checked the serial numbers of all of their handguns and locked them in one of the GSA high-security drawers. Unlike the others, Phil kept his holster, because it was his personal property. He reminded Hal that he had a SIG P228 at home and asked if he could keep his two issued spare thirteen-round magazines.</p><p>Hal nodded. &#x201c;Sure. Keep them&#x2014;and here are three more for you. Magazines are classified as &#x2018;expendable&#x2019; items and aren&#x2019;t even listed in our Property Book. Consider them an early retirement gift from Uncle Sam.&#x201d;</p><p>An inventory of all badges and credentials followed. Finally came the SCI debriefing for Phil, Brian, Clarence, and Scott. It seemed strangely surreal, as they sat and watched the same debriefing DVD that they had shown to countless others. They were all exhausted, sweaty, and grimy with ashes, and they smelled like diesel fuel. Once they had signed their DD Form 1848 debriefing memorandums (which reminded them that they were still bound by the strict terms of their DD Form 1847-1 SCI nondisclosure agreements for the rest of their lives), they were officially read off of SCI.</p><p>While they were signing their debrief/nondisclosure agreements, two members of the FEMA staff arrived. These men seemed confused and uncertain of what they should do in the Mother of All Emergencies. They soon gravitated to the television and watched CNN, transfixed, like millions of other Americans.</p><p>After signing out for the last time and a few handshakes out in the hall, the Tall Oakers simply drove off to an uncertain future.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>Phil returned to his apartment exhausted. He grabbed some leftover sushi takeout boxes from his refrigerator and ate, sipping a bottle of lemon-flavored sparkling spring water. He then resum...</p></p><h2>The High Blood Pressure Hoax</h2><p>Blood pressure drugs guarantee you will get worse, for they actually deplete the nutrients that cause high blood pressure, making sure you will need even more medications. They also shrink the brain and raise your risk of heart attack, senility and blindness. High blood pressure is not a deficiency of blood pressure-lowering drugs. But there are dozens of ways you can permanently cure your high blood pressure without drugs. And since healthy blood vessels determine the longevity of every organ in the entire body, you need this book even if you don&#39;t have high blood pressure, for vascular health is key to total body health and longevity. First of all every single cell of your body depends on the health of your blood vessels that supply them. If you don&#39;t want to get Alzheimer&#39;s, then you need a healthy brain, but it is only as healthy as its blood supply. Likewise, if you don&#39;t want cancer (or you are trying to heal it), it starts (and spreads) in areas of poor circulation. The High Blood Pressure Hoax will show you that for every ailment even one as simple as high blood pressure, there are multiple causes and multiple cures. You have a lot to choose from. In fact, I would suggest you read the entire book before you chose your program. For by understanding how the various causes work, you (who know your body and medical history better than anyone else) have the optimum opportunity for choosing the best solution for you. This is the ultimate plan for vascular health, but it doesn&#39;t stop there. It also continues on from where Detoxify or Die left off and takes you to more powerful levels of detoxification. I can&#39;t wait to empower you!

But these mountains are as perilous as they are beautiful: here is where the Donner Party was trapped and where scores of unlucky hikers must be rescued every year. <em>The Last Season</em> tells the inspiring, poignant story of Morgenson, who, over the course of twenty-eight summers living alone in this craggy wilderness, became a celebrated ranger in the National Park Service's most adventurous unit. For the solitary, introspective Morgenson, who grew up in Yosemite Valley and as a young man honed his mountaineering skills in the Himalayas, this was more than a job -- it was a calling. He became fiercely devoted to preventing outside forces from encroaching on the wilderness he loved.</p><p>But over the years, the isolation Morgenson had once cherished took its toll, and he grew increasingly estranged from his wife and friends. When, at the height of his struggles, he went missing without a trace in Kings Canyon National Park, where he had long patrolled, many suspected suicide or foul play. Morgenson, after all, had once said, "The least I owe these mountains is a body." As one of the Park Service's most intensive search-and-rescue operations unraveled, some wondered if they were searching for a man who did not want to be found.</p><p>Destined to become a classic in mountain literature, <em>The Last Season</em> is a work that is as captivating in its writing as it is compelling in its sense of adventure.

A young Massachusetts native, Francis was only three years removed from his youthful career as a lowly caddie. Harry was twice his age, the greatest British champion in history, and innovator of the modern grip and swing. Through exacting hard work, perseverance, and determination, Vardon had escaped a hopeless life of poverty; the unknown Ouimet dared to dream of following in his hero&#39;s footsteps. When the two men finally came together in their legendary battle at the 1913 U.S. Open, its heartstopping climax gave rise to the sport of golf as we know it today. Weaving the stories of Ouimet and Vardon as his narrative, Mark Frost creates a uniquely involving, intimate epic; equal parts sports biography, sweeping social history, and emotional human drama. Including historical photographs, The Greatest Game Ever Played is sure to be a must-read for millions of sports and history fans, and all who have ever dared to reach for their dreams.</p><p>Mark Frost is the author of the bestselling novels <i>The List of 7, The 6 Messiahs</i>, and <i>Before I wake</i>. This is his first nonfiction book. He received a Writer's Guild Award and an Emmy nomination for his work as executive story editor on the acclaimed television series <i>Hill Street Blues</i>, and was the co-creator and executive producer of the ABC television series <i>Twin Peaks</i>. He lives in Los Angeles and upstate New York.*Starred Review* The story of Francis Ouimet, the first amateur to win the U.S. Open golf tournament, is just too good to be true: it's <i>Rocky</i> without the sequels, it's Jack without his beanstalk, it's Tiger without Nike. But it's true, and as told by veteran thriller writer Frost, it's the most compelling sports book since Laura Hillenbrand's best-selling <i>Seabiscuit</i>. Born in 1893, Ouimet grew up poor, directly across the street from The Country Club in Brookline, Massachusetts, where Boston's blue bloods tried their hands at the new sport of golf. The game caught young Francis in its grip, and despite his father's disapproval, he became a caddie at the club and taught himself to play. Frost jumps between Ouimet's story and the surprisingly similar saga of British champion Harry Vardon, who was also born poor and contended with a disapproving father. Frost builds his characters--not just Ouimet and Vardon but also Francis' caddy, 10-year-old Eddie Lowery--with the skill of a novelist (occasionally but believably using invented dialogue). The climax of the narrative--the recounting of the 1913 U.S. Open at Brookline, where the unheralded, 20-year-old Ouimet beat both his idol Vardon and the other reigning British professional, Ted Ray--is genuinely exciting, a marvelous re-creation of a signature moment in golf history. Underdog stories have become among the sappiest cliches in pop-culture's arsenal, but this one reminds us why they worked in the first place. <i>Bill Ott</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Now Europe's foremost philosopher and activist confronts his spiritual roots and the religion that has always inspired and shaped him&#x2014;but that he has never fully reckoned with.<br><br> <i>The Genius of Judaism</i> is a breathtaking new vision and understanding of what it means to be a Jew, a vision quite different from the one we&#x2019;re used to. It is rooted in the Talmudic traditions of argument and conflict, rather than biblical commandments, borne out in struggle and study, not in blind observance. At the very heart of the matter is an obligation to the other, to the dispossessed, and to the forgotten, an obligation that, as L�vy vividly recounts, he has sought to embody over decades of championing &#x201c;lost causes,&#x201d; from Bosnia to Africa&#x2019;s forgotten wars, from Libya to the Kurdish Peshmerga&#x2019;s desperate fight against the Islamic State, a battle raging as we speak. L�vy offers a fresh, surprising critique of a new and stealthy form of anti-Semitism on the rise as well as a provocative defense of Israel from the left. He reveals the overlooked Jewish roots of Western democratic ideals and confronts the current Islamist threat while intellectually dismantling it. Jews are not a &#x201c;chosen people,&#x201d; L�vy explains, but a &#x201c;treasure&#x201d; whose spirit must continue to inform moral thinking and courage today.<br><br> L�vy&#x2019;s most passionate book, and in many ways his most personal, <i>The Genius of Judaism</i> is a great, profound, and hypnotic intellectual reckoning&#x2014;indeed a call to arms&#x2014;by one of the keenest and most insightful writers in the world.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>The Genius of Judaism</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;In <i>The Genius of Judaism, </i>L�vy elaborates on his credo by rebutting the pernicious and false logic behind current anti-Semitism and defends Israel as the world&#x2019;s most successful multi-ethnic democracy created from scratch. L�vy also makes the case for France&#x2019;s Jews being integral to the establishment of the French nation, the French language, and French literature. And last, but certainly not least, he presents a striking interpretation of the Book of Jonah. . . . A tour de force.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Forbes</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Ardent . . . L�vy&#x2019;s message is essentially uplifting: that the brilliant scholars of Judaism, the authors of the Talmud, provide elucidation into &#x2018;the great questions that have stirred humanity since the dawn of time.&#x2019; . . . A philosophical celebration of Judaism.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;L�vy (<i>Left in Dark Times</i>), a prominent French journalist and politically engaged philosopher, turns his observations inward here, pondering the teachings of Judaism and the role they have played in contemporary European history as well as in his own life and intellectual inquiry. . . .

These developments appear designed to put entire countries, and even the world, in a state of siege and emergency response.<br><br>The fact remains that anti-Semitism exists.<br><br>Some had thought it dead, obsolete, cast aside.<br><br>Wrong.<br><br>It is back.<br><br>Making new connections.<br><br>It has even begun to strike and to kill&#x2014;to growing indifference&#x2014;in French cities.<br><br>And, moreover, because observers of the phenomenon often seem blind to its new reality and, believing that they are confronting it, grapple only with its shadows, I see no option but to begin by describing the new guise of the oldest form of hate.<br><br>the virus and its mutations<br><br>For, in the beginning, are words.<br><br>Anti-Semitism is a very special form of madness, one of the features of which has always been, at every step in its history, choosing the right words to make its madness look reasonable.<br><br>At bottom, it is a language of pure rage, of brute violence without logic, which knows that it is never more convincing, never so strong or blessed with such a bright future, as when it succeeds in dressing up its resentment in legitimate-looking clothes.<br><br>And the anti-Semite is someone who, at the end of the day, has always managed to make it appear as if the hate that he feels for some is no more than the effect or reflection of the love he claims to feel for others.<br><br>There was the time when the anti-Semite said, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t hate the Jews so much as I adore the Lord Jesus Christ, whom the Jews so viciously abused.&#x201d; That was the Christian argument against a deicidal people.<br><br>There was the time, epitomized by the Enlightenment and its methodical nonbelief, when the anti-Semite corrected the first proposition, going so far as to reverse it: &#x201c;These people must be detested not because they killed Christ but because they invented him.&#x201d; That was the agnostic if not atheistic anti-Semitism of those who, like Voltaire, faulted the Jews not for being deicidal but for having invented monotheism.<br><br>Toward the end of the nineteenth century, when the capitalist mode of production was firmly established, there arrived a third form of hate, which consisted of saying, &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t care if the Jews invented or killed Christ&#x2014;we are not firm enough in our belief or unbelief to give this matter the importance that devotees on both sides gave it over the centuries. We are socialists. We care about the underdog and, filled with this concern, with our consuming love for the sacred common man, determined to find and break the chains that hold him down, we have no choice but to declare that the Jews are at the center of the most extensive system of extortion ever devised by man. And it is for this reason that we go after them.&#x201d; That was the anti-Semitism of French polemicist �douard Drumont, of the segment of the workers&#x2019; movement that opposed the pro-Dreyfus party, which was perceived as the incarnation of the &#x201c;banker&#x2019;s spirit&#x201d; and the &#x201c;mercantilist mind.&#x201d; It is that of the socialists who saw Dreyfus himself as the clandestine conductor of the gang of &#x201c;rapacious crows,&#x201d; as the &#x201c;yids of finance and politics,&#x201d; or even as a naked pretext employed by the &#x201c;Jewifying and swindling crowd&#x201d; to &#x201c;wash away all the stains of Israel&#x201d; (from a manifesto dated January 19, 1898, and signed by most of the socialist pundits of that time, including the great Jean Jaur�s). It is the socialism for imbeciles that swears not to have anything against Jews (really, nothing!) but everything (really, everything!) against &#x201c;Jewish capitalism&#x201d; using Dreyfus&#x2019;s name to &#x201c;rehabilitate&#x201d; itself and &#x201c;prevail&#x201d; in the war it is waging against &#x201c;the emaciated Christian nobility&#x201d; allied with the &#x201c;clerical&#x201d; minority of the bourgeoisie (from the same manifesto).<br><br>More recently there was a fourth strain, contemporaneous with the triumph of the life sciences, which made possible a vision of the world unknown in ancient times (and, in particular, in the Christian age, when the monogenesis of the sons of Adam was never really disputed). That fourth strain was the racist vision of the world. &#x201c;Like the socialists, we are neither Christian nor anti-Christian. We really don&#x2019;t care whether the Jews are tied to the deadly world of money. But what is in fact worrisome is that they constitute another race, an impure, mongrel race. And we find ourselves in the regrettable position of observing the ravages that that race has caused in the healthy and beautiful Aryan races.&#x201d; This is a wholly separate strain of anti-Semitism, distinct in its mottoes and its consequences. Born with Renan, Vacher de Lapouge, Chamberlain, and Gobineau, it is the anti-Semitism that made possible Hitler&#x2019;s Final Solution.<br><br>Four forms of anti-Semitism, each distinct from the one that preceded it.<br><br>Four forms that had to differ in order to resonate with the spirit of the era, adapt themselves to the era&#x2019;s capacities for action and perhaps to what it wanted to hear&#x2014;and so to expand their audience and propagate optimally within the social echo chamber.<br><br>Forms that are like so many faces of the same demon spirit, which take over from one another, replace one another, and are, in Hegelian parlance, successively &#x201c;relieved,&#x201d; either because the earlier face was no longer consistent with the sensibilities or the ideological needs of the new period (What does a follower of Voltaire care about the theme of a deicidal people? What does a follower of Hitler care about eliminating oppression?) or because the mask cracks and the alibi can no longer disguise the plainly criminal foundation for which it has served as a screen (as in the moment when Jaur�s, who not only signed but also wrote most of the manifesto of January 19, 1898, cautioning the proletariat against taking sides between the two &#x201c;rival bourgeois factions&#x201d; that were tearing each other apart over Dreyfus, understands the trap into which he has fallen and chooses Zola&#x2019;s side) or because the mechanism put in place proves more criminal than anticipated (as was the case with the many anti-Semitic Catholics who realized, at the end, the unsuspected scale of the crimes committed in the name of Catholicism; as with the disciples of Maurras or even of Drumont, some of whom recoiled in horror before the evidence of the gas chambers and the reality of extermination!).<br><br>beasts cured of the plague?<br><br>That is where we stand today.<br><br>That is precisely what is happening, once again, in the early years of this century.<br><br>There are still anti-Semitic Catholics, of course, but they are an isolated minority who keep a low profile when, by chance, they score a point, as when they persuaded John Paul II to canonize one of his predecessors, Pius IX, who believed Jews were &#x201c;dogs&#x201d; that could be heard &#x201c;barking in the streets&#x201d; and &#x201c;bother us wherever we go.&#x201d;<br><br>There are still followers of Voltaire, unreconstructed tormentors of priests, die-hard secularists, who continue to think that the religion of the One God is the mother of all dictatorships, an insult to the freedom of the mind, a disease&#x2014;and that the only way to get rid of Christianity is to hit it over the head or, even better, to pull it up by the roots, which, as everyone knows, are Jewish. But this, too, is marginal; it is a rear-guard struggle. Apart from a few God-is-dead throwbacks and oddly wired Nietzscheans, as well as those who mix everything up and confuse the fundamentalist deviations of theo-political Islam with Islam writ large, not too many people believe that the war on faith is an urgent matter.<br><br>The habit of equating Jews with money and the Pavlovian diabolization that results from that equation have not been relegated to ancient history. But on this score the words of Georges Bernanos are borne out. In an article entitled &#x201c;The Jewish Question&#x2014;Again,&#x201d; which appeared in a Brazilian newspaper on May 24, 1944, Bernanos asserted that Hitler had &#x201c;dishonored&#x201d; anti-Semitism. An awful thing to say, of course, because it implies that anti-Semitism could be &#x201c;honorable.&#x201d; But it expresses the terror that gripped the heirs of Socialism for Dummies when they discovered the vast cemeteries that Nazism had strewn around Europe, for which the tale of &#x201c;moneyed Jews&#x201d; was partly responsible. And the same remark might explain today how neither the financial crisis nor the patent misdeeds of globalized capitalism, nor, in France, the path taken by the young minister of the economy, Emmanuel Macron, through a bank with a name (Rothschild) that was, along with that of the Foulds and P�reires, one of the targets of Drumont&#x2019;s La France juive, will succeed in re-inflaming, except residually, the fevers of the era of the Dreyfus affair.<br><br>As for racist anti-Semitism; as for the idea that it is genes or consistency of biological or cultural traits that make Jews a legitimate target of hate; as for the will to &#x201c;free the race,&#x201d; that is, to relentlessly and mercilessly &#x201c;destroy&#x201d; the foreign &#x201c;forces&#x201d; that are corrupting its healthy, glowing purity; as for the charge that had been made to a &#x201c;horrible little Jew&#x201d; (Georges Bernanos is speaking) named Adolphe Cr�mieux for naturalizing &#x201c;en masse&#x201d; a whole &#x201c;horde&#x201d; of Algerian Jews who had &#x201c;nothing to do&#x201d; with France, shared none of its &#x201c;history&#x201d; or &#x201c;values,&#x201d; and did not even have the merit, like their Arab neighbors, of having formed military units to go and shed their blood in France&#x2019;s wars: Well, here we are at the heart of what Hitlerism indeed rendered practically inaudible. Tiny cells&#x2014;sure. Handfuls of illiterates nostalgic for the Third Reich&#x2014;that, too. But crowds of Europeans dreaming, seventy years after Auschwitz, of &#x201c;destroying&#x201d; the &#x201c;Jewish race . . . by any means&#x201d;? A political force calling for the revocation of the decree that I have to thank for the fact that, like many other children of soldiers in the French African army of 1943, I today am French? A mass movement calling, as did Drumont and Bernanos (not to mention Wagner and Chamberlain), for the &#x201c;excision&#x201d; of the Jewish &#x201c;tumor&#x201d;? No, we will not see that again.<br><br>In other words, anti-Semitism can reappear as a major force only by assuming a new guise.<br><br>It can recommence firing people up and mobilizing them on a grand scale only by acquiring a new way of speaking and a new sales pitch.<br><br>And that, in fact, is what has been happening for the last two or three decades with the gradual articulation and accumulation of a set of propositions that are, I repeat, new enough not to be fatally compromised by the criminal scenes of the past and, even more importantly, appear to be in step with present-day sensibilities, emotions, and preoccupations&#x2014;and even with current notions of what is just, true, and good.<br><br>the foundations for future ravings<br><br>Proposition no. 1: We have nothing against the Jews. We reject in word and deed the toxic ideology that was anti-Semitism in ages past. But we must regretfully point out that being Jewish seems, in a great many cases, to be defined by allegiance to Israel, which is (1) illegitimate, because it was planted where it did not belong, and (2) colonialist, racist, fundamentally criminal, and even fascist in its attempts to silence the voices of its opponents. And so, despite our goodwill and anti-racist vigilance, despite the sympathy that we have always had and continue to have, in principle, with this victimized people and its ageless ordeals, we do not see how we can consider those who call themselves Jews innocent of this fascism. This is the anti-Zionist argument. It goes as follows: &#x201c;How nice the Jew seemed during the war the world waged for him. But then came Zionism and, with it, the conversion of victim into executioner and the tragic and ruinous dialectic by which the Jew declares war against the world. No, that is not acceptable.&#x201d;<br><br>Proposition no. 2: We have nothing (truly, nothing) against the Jews, they say. Their suffering over the centuries inspires universal compassion. But it strikes us that the central argument of Zionism&#x2014;the argument on which the right of Israel to exist is based and justified, and which is trotted out like a &#x201c;moral sledgehammer&#x201d; (the phrase was used by German novelist Martin Walser during a 1999 debate over the form of the memorial planned for the center of Berlin) whenever one raises the objection of the unforgivable spoliation that lies at the source of that existence&#x2014;is the chapter in their history of suffering referred to as the Holocaust. So, they continue, what about this &#x201c;Holocaust&#x201d;? Is it not obvious that it is a murky crime whose historical verity has yet to be fully established? A misfortune that, if not wholly imaginary, is exaggerated by survivors and the children of survivors, who have made it into a religion? And even if not imagined or exaggerated, even if the numbers are accurate and the killing procedures are as described in the abundant literature associated with the &#x201c;Holocaust industry,&#x201d; what are six million deaths on the scale not only of world history but of the wars of the twentieth century? And what is the purpose of the insistent claim to be the survivors of an unprecedented crime, unique in the annals of history and incomparable to any other, if not to make people feel guilty and, in the name of an infinite debt, demand limitless reparations? The reader will have recognized the more or less radical facets of this strange rant, which we know as Holocaust denial, Holocaust revisionism, and negationism. And we can see how a second terrible complaint is set up: How pathetic that these unscrupulous people lay claim to a dubiously exceptional status in order to build a state the very principle of which is unjustifiable! Shame on these traffickers in cadavers, who stop short of no lie, no moral swindle, no trick of memory, to arrive at their criminal ends! They deserve not only hate but scorn, these brazen calculators who, to quash the legitimate objections that their underhanded actions inspire in good people, dare to manipulate something that, since time immemorial, humanity has held sacred: the memory of their dead.</p><h2>The Princess Bride (Ballantine Reader&#39;s Circle)</h2><p>What happens when the most beautiful girl in the world marries the handsomest prince of all time and he turns out to be...well...a lot less than the man of her dreams?<br><br>As a boy, William Goldman claims, he loved to hear his father read the "S.

Guaranteed to entertain both young and old alike by combining scenes of rowsing fantasy with hilarious reality, THE PRINCESS BRIDE secures Goldman's place as a master storyteller.<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><p><i>The Princess Bride</i> is a true fantasy classic. William Goldman describes it as a "good parts version" of "S. Morgenstern's Classic Tale of True Love and High Adventure." Morgenstern's original was filled with details of Florinese history, court etiquette, and Mrs. Morgenstern's mostly complimentary views of the text. Much admired by academics, the "Classic Tale" nonetheless obscured what Mr. Goldman feels is a story that has everything: "Fencing. Fighting. Torture. Poison. True love. Hate. Revenge. Giants. Hunters. Bad men. Good men. Beautifulest ladies. Snakes. Spiders. Beasts of all natures and descriptions. Pain. Death. Brave men. Coward men. Strongest men. Chases. Escapes. Lies. Truths. Passion. Miracles." <p> Goldman frames the fairy tale with an "autobiographical" story: his father, who came from Florin, abridged the book as he read it to his son. Now, Goldman is publishing an abridged version, interspersed with comments on the parts he cut out. </p> <p> Is <i>The Princess Bride</i> a critique of classics like <i>Ivanhoe</i> and <i>The Three Musketeers</i>, that smother a ripping yarn under elaborate prose? A wry look at the differences between fairy tales and real life? Simply a funny, frenetic adventure? No matter how you read it, you'll put it on your "keeper" shelf. <i>--Nona Vero</i></p>Believe it or not, my future husband used this book to win my hand. I think giving it to me as a gift was his way of proving that he is a hopeless romantic, since the book is so wonderfully hopelessly romantic. So far, he's lived up to it! If you've only seen the movie, but love it, then you should definitely read the book. Also look for the 25th Anniversary (yes, it's really been that long) edition this Christmas--it includes the first chapter of the forthcoming sequel, Buttercup's Baby. <br></p><h2>What Mrs McGillicuddy Saw!

Few will be unmoved by the tactics employed by whites to disrupt the subsequent boycott; at the center, always, is Parks's dignified, calm recounting of outrages against her and other women and men, giving her words weight and impact as no raw fury could. Like sitting at the knee of an elder with much to tell, reading her story leads to ever more questions ('What was it really like then?') and shock that such injustices not only existed in the recent past but still linger."&nbsp;<i>- Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p>Rosa Parks also worked with Jim Haskins to write <b>Rosa Parks: My Story</b> (Dial and Puffin), an award-winning book for older readers. Mrs. Parks was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor in June 1999. She lives in Detroit, Michigan.Many readers of this absorbing autobiography will be familiar with the incident for which Rosa Parks is best known: on December 1, 1955, she refused to surrender her seat to a white person on a Montgomery, Ala.,stet comma/rl city bus. What this book provides is a framework that will enable its audience to put this historic moment into a broader context, and to appreciate the monumental effect on one woman and on an entire nation. Long before Parks's stand against racial segregation, her "very strong sense of what was fair" had provoked her to launch her own personal campaign against injustice. In lively anecdotal style, she describes her early family life and schooling, her run-ins with disdainful white children, her courtship and marriage to Raymond Parks and her active role in the Montgomery NAACP and in the civil rights movement. The simplicity and candor of this courageous woman's voice make these compelling events even more moving and dramatic. Some readers will be stunned by Parks's firsthand accounts of violence against blacks; all will be deeply impressed by her boundless energy and courage.

Kamen sets the notorious Christian tribunal into the broader context of Islamic and Jewish culture in the Mediterranean, reassesses its consequences for Jewish culture, measures its impact on Spain&#39;s intellectual life, and firmly rebuts a variety of myths and exaggerations that have distorted understandings of the Inquisition. He concludes with disturbing reflections on the impact of state security organizations in our own time&#34;--</p><p>Mention the Spanish Inquisition and immediately thoughts of brutal torture and callous witch-hunts spring to mind. Popular belief holds up this infamous institution as a symbol of religious and political intolerance--against the Protestants, Jews, Catholic heretics, and political orders such as the Knights Templar. Yet when Henry Kamen first wrote <i>The Spanish Inquisition</i> in 1965, he argued that the Inquisition was not as powerful or cruel as commonly conceived. <p> This updated version of Kamen's hypothesis continues and reaffirms his original arguments. In this edition, Kamen provides additional evidence derived mostly from monographic studies conducted by other scholars that separates myth from reality; Kamen suggests that the Inquisition did not enjoy widespread popularity, in Spain or the rest of Europe, and that it was used as a device to scare off enemies. He also concludes that the failure of the Spanish populace to accept Lutheran principles had more to do with popular indifference toward Protestantism than interference from the Inquisition. Though Kamen's book is occasionally lacking in social analysis, this revisionist overview of the Inquisition's impact on Europe is rich in detail and will appeal to anyone who has an interest in this period.</p>A very well researched, kaleidoscopic study of late medieval and early modern Europe's most notorious--if hardly its most devastating--religious and racial witch hunt. Kamen, a veteran British historian of the Iberian Peninsula (Philip of Spain, 1997, etc.), professor of the Higher Council of Scientific Research, Barcelona, and a fellow of the Royal Historical Society, traces the Inquisition's various classes of victims. These included the conversos (recent Jewish converts to Catholicism, who composed the majority of the Inquisition's victims), followers of the humanist Erasmus, Lutherans and other Protestants (including foreigners), Moriscos (recent Muslim converts), and Catholics whom the tribunal deemed ``heretical,'' often on flimsy evidence. Kamen is informative on the structure and problems of the Inquisition, noting for example the struggles between the papacy and the Spanish crown over its control (the latter gained the upper hand), corruption by some of its officials, and regional differences in enforcing its decrees. His main ``revision'' is to historicize the Inquisition, in the sense of contextualizing its brutal intolerance; he notes for example that ``the Netherlands [in the mid-16th century] already possessed an Inquisition of its own'' and that the courts in Antwerp (then part of Holland) ``between 1557 and 1562 executed 103 heretics, more than died in the whole of Spain in that period.'' Kamen also points out how Protestant and other writers mythified the Inquisition, exaggerating its cruelties in the service of anti-Catholic propaganda. Historians also err, Kamen argues, in assigning to the Inquisition primary blame for Spain's decline as a European power; he marshals impressive evidence against this thesis. However, Kamen occasionally over-relativizes the Inquisition, going so far as to say that it created no new problems for Spain. Yet the strengths of Kamen's work, which undoubtedly will prove controversial, far exceed its shortcomings. While its wealth of detail will appeal more to academics and other specialists than to lay readers, its clear prose makes it accessible to all. -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.

In terms of living, it is a time of courting, birthing, foraging and feeding, avoiding being eaten, growing, and lastly preparing for winter. Furthermore, unlike in winter or life under severe desert conditions, nothing is static. Most of us live in a world where timing is everything. Here in Vermont and Maine where I live, there is about a week to prepare the soil, another to plant the peas, another to put in the tomato plants. There is a week where the bees pollinate the apple trees and a week for us to harvest the fruit, and another to dig the potatoes. All nature is on a tight schedule. The wood frogs mate in mid-April, the robins return late April, the blueberries bloom in May, and the geese migrate north the second week in October. Summer as we know it is not a uniform struggle against excessive heat and lack of water. It is instead a continually shifting schedule of living where the lives of one species adjust to those of others.</p> <p>So, as I set out to write <i>Summer World</i>, my focus changed. One potential approach was to discuss various topics such as mating, nesting, feeding and predator avoidance. Instead, it seemed possibly more engaging to concentrate on conspicuous aspects of the lives of common, every-day animals and plants that we tend to take for granted but that are marvelous because of their hidden agendas and concealed complexities.</p> <p>It seems to me that we are in a perpetual crisis mode where attention is rightly focused on what is wrong with the world, although too little appreciation is given to what is right with it. Nature is always right. It always bats last; it is the final arbiter of all things that concern every living thing. So I focused on the first thing I saw that captured my attention: mating wood frogs. This species breeds in large crowds that gather for a one- to several-day orgy in almost every temporary little pool, of which there are more that a dozen within my neighborhood. It was a joy to watch the frogs&#x2019; antics, and I tried to trick them to find out what they respond to, and to then contemplate and figure out their various stratagems. The frogs were strange, comical and counter-intuitive. The noisy males were not only competing fiercely to catch any female they could but also unknowingly, I presume, cooperating in attracting them. Nothing that they did was obvious to me without first delving into their detailed life histories.</p> <p><b> Continue Reading On <i>Summer World</i></b> [PDF]</p><p>The author of numerous bestselling and award-winning books, Bernd Heinrich is a professor of biology at the University of Vermont.

BOMC. First serial, Time. Tour.</p><p>This autobiography of Lt. Colonel Oliver North covers his childhood, his military career--including Vietnam, his troubled marriage, near nervous breakdown and his own version of the events that became known as Iran-Contra. The subjective storytelling techniques he and co-author William Novak chose work well in the audio format. Without being too obvious, Christopher Hurt gives the impression of someone telling his own story sounding confused, angry, incredulous or grateful, as needed. The program includes some notes and an appendix with two documents: a commendation from Ronald Reagan and a plea for clemency prepared by his lawyers. W.W.G. (c)AudioFile, Portland, MaineWritten in secret as if it were a covert operation, then suddenly released, this is unquestionably the "event" book of the year. Here, finally, we might expect to get answers to our questions about what became known as "Iran-contra." Was Marine Lieutenant Colonel North a "loose cannon" on the National Security Council, making U.S. foreign policy on his own? And just what did President Reagan really know about Iran-contra? North writes that Reagan "knew everything" about Iran-contra's covert operations. So too did Vice President Bush. Unfortunately, there is no specific document in the book proving that. What there is, however, is a preponderance of material that leads to an inevitable conclusion: North was a hard-working, well-trained, loyal Marine incapable of undertaking a covert operation without approval by his superiors. For the first time, we hear of and read a document sent to Reagan by North's lawyers, setting forth a sound legal argument for a presidential pardon for North. The letter, we learn, was never acknowledged. There are a number of such chilling moments in this important book. Recommended for most libraries.<br><i>- Chet Hagan, Berks Cty. P.L.

All they were composed of was memories and heart. Atop one of Sept-Tours&#x2019; round towers, Emily Mather pressed a diaphanous hand against the spot in the center of her chest that even now was heavy with dread.<br><br> <i>Does it ever get easier?</i>&nbsp;Her voice, like the rest of her, was almost imperceptible.&nbsp;<i>The watching? The waiting? The knowing?<br></i><br> <i>Not that I&#x2019;ve noticed,</i>&nbsp;Philippe de Clermont replied shortly. He was perched nearby, studying his own transparent fingers. Of all the things Philippe disliked about being dead&#x2014;the inability to touch his wife, Ysabeau; his lack of smell or taste; the fact that he had no muscles for a good sparring match&#x2014;invisibility topped the list. It was a constant reminder of how inconsequential he had become.<br><br> Emily&#x2019;s face fell, and Philippe silently cursed himself. Since she&#x2019;d died, the witch had been his constant companion, cutting his loneliness in two. What was he thinking, barking at her as if she were a servant?<br><br> <i>Perhaps it will be easier when they don&#x2019;t need us anymore,</i>&nbsp;Philippe said in a gentler tone. He might be the more experienced ghost, but it was Emily who understood the metaphysics of their situation. What the witch had told him went against everything Philippe believed about the afterworld. He thought the living saw the dead&nbsp;<i>because&nbsp;</i>they needed something from them: assistance, forgiveness, retribution. Emily insisted these were nothing more than human myths, and it was only when the living moved on and let go that the dead could appear to them.<br><br> This information made Ysabeau&#x2019;s failure to notice him somewhat easier to bear, but not much.<br><br> &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t wait to see Em&#x2019;s reaction. She&#x2019;s going to be so surprised.&#x201d; Diana&#x2019;s warm alto floated up to the battlements.<br><br> <i>Diana and Matthew,</i>&nbsp;Emily and Philippe said in unison, peering down to the cobbled courtyard that surrounded the ch�teau.<br><br> <i>There,</i>&nbsp;Philippe said, pointing at the drive. Even dead, he had vampire sight that was sharper than any human&#x2019;s. He was also still handsomer than any man had a right to be, with his broad shoulders and devilish grin. He turned the latter on Emily, who couldn&#x2019;t help grinning back.&nbsp;<i>They are a fine couple, are they not? Look how much my son has changed.<br></i><br> Vampires weren&#x2019;t supposed to be altered by the passing of time, and therefore Emily expected to see the same black hair, so dark it glinted blue; the same mutable gray-green eyes, cool and remote as a winter sea; the same pale skin and wide mouth. There were a few subtle differences, though, as Philippe suggested. Matthew&#x2019;s hair was shorter, and he had a beard that made him look even more dangerous, like a pirate. She gasped.<br><br> <i>Is Matthew . . . bigger?<br></i><br> <i>He is. I fattened him up when he and Diana were here in 1590. Books were making him soft. Matthew needed to fight more and read less.&nbsp;</i>Philippe had always contended there was such a thing as too much education. Matthew was living proof of it.<br><br> <i>Diana looks different, too. More like her mother, with that long, coppery hair,</i>&nbsp;Em said, acknowledging the most obvious change in her niece.<br><br> Diana stumbled on a cobblestone, and Matthew&#x2019;s hand shot out to steady her. Once, Emily had seen Matthew&#x2019;s incessant hovering as a sign of vampire overprotectiveness. Now, with the perspicacity of a ghost, she realized that this tendency stemmed from his preternatural awareness of every change in Diana&#x2019;s expression, every shift of mood, every sign of fatigue or hunger. Today, however, Matthew&#x2019;s concern seemed even more focused and acute.<br><br> <i>It&#x2019;s not just Diana&#x2019;s hair that has changed.&nbsp;</i>Philippe&#x2019;s face had a look of wonder.&nbsp;<i>Diana is with child&#x2014;Matthew&#x2019;s child.<br></i><br> Emily examined her niece more carefully, using the enhanced grasp of truth that death afforded. Philippe was right&#x2014;in part.&nbsp;<i>You mean &#x201c;with&nbsp;</i>children.<i>&#x201d; Diana is having twins.<br></i><br> <i>Twins,&nbsp;</i>Philippe said in an awed voice. He looked away, distracted by the appearance of his wife.&nbsp;<i>Look, here are Ysabeau and Sarah with Sophie and Margaret.<br></i><br> <i>What will happen now, Philippe?</i>&nbsp;Emily asked, her heart growing heavier with anticipation.<br><br> <i>Endings. Beginnings,</i>&nbsp;Philippe said with deliberate vagueness.&nbsp;<i>Change.<br></i><br> <i>Diana has never liked change,&nbsp;</i>Emily said.<br><br> <i>That is because Diana is afraid of what she must become,&nbsp;</i>Philippe replied.<br><br> * * *<br><br> Marcus Whitmore had faced horrors aplenty since the night in 1781 when Matthew de Clermont made him a vampire. None had prepared him for today&#x2019;s ordeal: telling Diana Bishop that her beloved aunt, Emily Mather, was dead.<br><br> <i>Marcus had received the phone call from Ysabeau while he and Nathaniel Wilson were watching the television news in the family library. Sophie, Nathaniel&#x2019;s wife, and their baby, Margaret, were dozing on a nearby sofa.<br></i><br> <i>&#x201c;The temple,&#x201d; Ysabeau had said breathlessly, her tone frantic. &#x201c;Come. At once.&#x201d;<br></i><br> <i>Marcus had obeyed his grandmother without question, only taking time to shout for his cousin, Gallowglass, and his Aunt Verin on his way out the door.<br></i><br> <i>The summer half-light of evening had lightened further as he approached the clearing at the top of the mountain, brightened by the otherworldly power that Marcus glimpsed through the trees. His hair stood at attention at the magic in the air.<br></i><br> <i>Then he scented the presence of a vampire, Gerbert of Aurillac. And someone else&#x2014;a witch.<br></i><br> A light, purposeful step sounded down the stone corridor, drawing Marcus out of the past and back into the present. The heavy door opened, creaking as it always did.<br><br> &#x201c;Hello, sweetheart.&#x201d; Marcus turned from the view of the Auvergne countryside and drew a deep breath. Phoebe Taylor&#x2019;s scent reminded him of the thicket of lilac bushes that had grown outside the red-painted door of his family&#x2019;s farm. Delicate and resolute, the fragrance had symbolized the hope of spring after a long Massachusetts winter and conjured up his long-dead mother&#x2019;s understanding smile. Now it only made Marcus think of the petite, iron-willed woman before him.<br><br>&#x201c;Everything will be all right.&#x201d; Phoebe reached up and straightened his collar, her olive eyes full of concern. Marcus had taken to wearing more formal clothes than concert T-shirts around the same time he&#x2019;d started to sign his letters Marcus de Clermont instead of Marcus Whitmore&#x2014;the name she&#x2019;d first known him by, before he had told her about vampires, fifteen-hundred-year-old fathers, French castles full of forbidding relatives, and a witch named Diana Bishop. It was, in Marcus&#x2019;s opinion, nothing short of miraculous that Phoebe had remained at his side.<br><br>&#x201c;No. It won&#x2019;t.&#x201d; He caught one of her hands and planted a kiss on the palm. Phoebe didn&#x2019;t know Matthew. &#x201c;Stay here with Nathaniel and the rest of them. Please.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;For the final time, Marcus Whitmore, I will be standing beside you when you greet your father and his wife. I don&#x2019;t believe we need discuss it further.&#x201d; Phoebe held out her hand. &#x201c;Shall we?&#x201d;<br><br>Marcus put his hand in Phoebe&#x2019;s, but instead of following her out the door as she expected, he tugged her toward him. Phoebe came to rest against his chest, one hand clasped in his and the other pressed to his heart. She looked at him with surprise.<br><br>&#x201c;Very well. But if you come down with me, Phoebe, there are conditions. First, you are with me or with Ysabeau at all times.&#x201d;<br><br>Phoebe opened her mouth to protest, but Marcus&#x2019;s serious look silenced her.<br><br>&#x201c;Second, if I tell you to leave the room, you will do so. No delay. No questions. Go straight to Fernando. He&#x2019;ll be in the chapel or the kitchen.&#x201d; Marcus searched her face and saw a wary acceptance. &#x201c;Third, do not, under any circumstances, get within arm&#x2019;s reach of my father. Agreed?&#x201d;<br><br> Phoebe nodded. Like any good diplomat, she was prepared to follow Marcus&#x2019;s rules&#x2014;for now. But if Marcus&#x2019;s father was the monster some in the house seemed to think he was, Phoebe would do what she must.</p><h2>Lone Wolf and Cub, Vol. 1: Assassin&#39;s Road</h2><p>Dark Horse Comics is proud to present one of the authentic landmarks in graphic fiction, <i>Lone Wolf and Cub,</i> to be published in its entirety for the first time in America.

I was wet and hot with fever and somewhere in the night I started coughing. Each expulsion felt like another blade plunging into my stomach. The nurse checked my bandages, then told me not to cough, which wasn&#x2019;t at all helpful. In spite of the medications they gave me to help me sleep, for most of the night I just lay there, lonely and aching. I wanted McKale more than life. Definitely more than life. Of course, if she were with me, I wouldn&#x2019;t be in this mess in the first place. Exhaustion finally overcame me and I fell asleep around 4 or 5 A.M.<br> <br>The next day I woke to a young nurse walking around my bed looking at monitors and writing on a clipboard. Since I&#x2019;d been admitted to the hospital, a bevy of nurses and doctors had been swarming around me in my delirium, flashing in and out of my consciousness like dancers in a music video. But I didn&#x2019;t remember any of them. This was the first nurse I was cognizant of. She was small, petite, and barely the height of a floor lamp. I watched her for a few minutes then said, &#x201c;Morning.&#x201d;<br> <br>She looked up from her clipboard. &#x201c;Good afternoon.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What time is it?&#x201d; I asked. It was kind of a funny question since I didn&#x2019;t even know what day, or week, it was. The last two weeks had run together like eggs in a blender.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s almost twelve-thirty,&#x201d; she said, then added, &#x201c;Friday.&#x201d;<br> <br><i>Friday</i>. I had left Seattle on a Friday. I&#x2019;d been gone for just fourteen days. Fourteen days and a lifetime.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Norma,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Are you hungry?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How about an Egg McMuffin?&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>She grinned. &#x201c;Not unless you can find one made of Jell-O.

The butterscotch is edible.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Butterscotch pudding for breakfast?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Lunch,&#x201d; she corrected. &#x201c;Also, in a couple hours we&#x2019;re sending you in for a CT scan.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;When can I take the catheter out?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;When you can walk to the bathroom on your own&#x2014;which we&#x2019;ll attempt after we get the results back from your scan.

A Valium.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t need anything,&#x201d; I said. I didn&#x2019;t care about the scan; I wanted the catheter out of me. In the haze of the last forty-eight hours, I vaguely remembered pulling the catheter out and making a real mess of things.<br> <br>I had two good reasons for wanting it out; first, because it hurt. No one should stick anything up that part of the male anatomy. Second, an infection from a catheter is what killed my wife. The sooner the thing was out, the better.<br> <br>A hospital orderly, a husky young freckled man wearing bright purple scrubs, came for me around two in the afternoon. He unhooked some wires and tubes from my body, then wheeled my entire bed down the linoleum corridor to radiology.

Frank Baum</b>, is part of the <i>Barnes &amp; Noble Classics</i><i>&nbsp;</i>series, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras.

Since its first publication in 1900, <b>L. Frank Baum</b>&#x2019;s story of a little girl carried away by a tornado to the strange and beautiful Land of Oz has had an extraordinary emotional impact on wide-eyed readers young and old.<br><br>As Dorothy journeys down the yellow brick road to the Emerald City, hoping the Great and Terrible Wizard who lives there will help her return home, she shares adventures with the famous trio of characters, defeats a wicked witch, and learns about the power of friendship, loyalty, and self-confidence. While scholars have debated for decades over possible political meanings hidden within the tale, Baum himself claimed he simply wanted to write a &#x201c;modernized fairy tale, in which the wonderment and joy are retained and the heartaches and nightmares are left out.&#x201d; As it has done for generations past, this classic of fantasy adventure speaks movingly about what every child needs: the Woodman&#x2019;s compassion, the Lion&#x2019;s courage, and the Scarecrow&#x2019;s wisdom.<br><br><b>With original illustrations by William Wallace Denslow.</b><br><b>J. T. Barbarese</b> teaches at Rutgers University in Camden, New Jersey, where he is a member of the Rutgers Center for Children and Childhood Studies. He is the author of four books of poetry and a translation of Euripides.</p><p>To commemorate the 100th anniversary of the publication of L. Frank Baum's <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>, master paper engineer Robert Sabuda has created a pop-up version of Dorothy's adventures in Oz that fans will find hard to resist. Modeling his depictions of Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, and the rest after W. W. Denslow's original art, Sabuda adds a third dimension that would have rocked Denslow's--and Baum's--world. A rapidly spinning cyclone actually casts a breeze over the startled reader's face. Glorious red poppies wave seductively in a field. And the Emerald City positively glitters with green, especially when young readers try on the special tinted "Spectacles for You" provided in a pocket on the page. The abridged text, provided in minibooklets set onto each page, covers enough basics for the Oz novice, but we recommend a read-aloud of the original, as well, for all the glory and detail of Baum's fantastic tale. Sabuda's homage to the classic is truly spectacular; even purists will gasp in delight at the sight of the humbug wizard floating away in his shiny green, gold, and blue hot-air balloon. This great introduction to the story of Oz doubles as a fun collector's item.

She and her husband, Roy, have three grown children and live in Minnesota. size : 5.2 x 8From Chapter One - Threats in the Night<br> Along whistle sounded in the night. Startled, Katherine O'Connell jerked awake. Her eyes flew open as she wondered, <i>Where am I</i>? <br> A dim light pierced the darkness. Beneath Kate, even the floor rumbled. <br> Again the whistle sounded. Its mournful call helped Kate remember. She was on a train traveling to Michigan's Upper Peninsula. <i>Soon I'll be in Copper Country! I'll meet my Irish cousin, Megan!</i> <br> Even the thought brought Kate more fully awake. In the seat facing hers, Kate's stepbrother Anders was still sleeping. So was their friend Erik Lundgren. <br> Slowly Kate stood up and stepped around her brother's big feet to reach the aisle. As Kate started through the railroad car, a man glanced up, staring at her with resentful eyes. <br> Kate shivered and looked away. Just as quickly she glanced back. She had never seen the man before. Why should he act as if he disliked her? Whoever the man was, he had already pulled a hat down over his face. <br> When Kate reached the rear of the car, she took a long drink at the water cooler. During the night, the gas lights had been turned down, leaving long shadows. <br> <i>I'll wash up now</i>, Kate thought. In that third week of July 1907, black clouds of smoke often blew in through the open windows. All through the long, hot trip from northwest Wisconsin, soot and cinders had found their way onto Kate's clothing. <br> The water felt good against her face. When she came out of the washroom, she took another drink. From somewhere she heard voices. <br> Curious as always, Kate followed the dimly lighted hallway outside the washroom. Beyond a partly open door, two people stood on the platform at the end of the car. <br> "I tell you, they'll cause trouble," a man said. <br> "A bunch of brats?" The second voice was low, yet scornful. With the rumble of the train, Kate could barely hear. "How can they upset our plans?" <br> "I saw them, and they're not stupid. The boys are over six feet tall." <br> <i>Six feet tall</i>? Kate thought. Whoever the person was, he had to be talking about Anders and Erik. In the land of Swedish-Americans where they lived, that height wasn't unusual for thirteen-year-olds. But now someone had noticed it. <br> Kate edged forward, as close to the door as she dared. Both people wore men's business suits and hats. With their backs toward Kate, they stood next to the railing that surrounded the platform. <br> "I heard them talking," the man went on. "The boys look strong. Good muscles in their shoulders. They're used to working." <br> The other person laughed. "Not like you, huh? What are you, Curly-a coward?" <br> Again Kate crept forward. Above the clickety-clack of the wheels, she could barely hear the second voice. <br> "You said it was a quick find, an easy steal," answered the man named Curly. "Already you've been there six months. When are you going to find something?" <br> "It takes time." The other voice was still muffled by the sounds of the train. "I'll find that map yet." <br> "I'm tired of working for peanuts!" Curly's voice rose in anger. "Let's get out while we still can." <br> "No!" The word was sharp and angry. <br> Kate jumped back. Just in time she remembered the dim light behind her. If the men turned around, they would see her. <br> "I'm not giving up now," the second voice went on. "Just do what I tell you!" <br> Curly's hoarse laugh cut off the rest of the words. "You're not my boss!" <br> The other voice broke in again. "It all fits-the O'Connells and the Mitchells together." <br> Kate's stomach tightened. Her cousin Megan's father worked for a man named James Mitchell. <br> "It's too dangerous," Curly warned. <br> "Hush, you fool!" <br> "Don't call <i>me</i> a fool!" Curly exclaimed. <br> "We're wasting time when we need to plan," the other voice answered. "Once we get there, we can't be seen together." <br> "Well, do you have any more ideas?" Curly asked. "Good ones, I mean." <br> "Let's use the brats you're so afraid of." <br> A band of fear tightened around Kate's heart. The person had to mean Anders and Erik and probably her. <br> "Maybe they'll find something we haven't. Let <i>them</i> solve the mystery. Let them lead us to the treasure!" <br> <i>The treasure</i>? Without thought of her own danger, Kate crept forward again, straining to hear. <br> "They probably don't even know about it," Curly answered. <br> "They will," the second voice said. "Everyone coming into the area hears the story, just like we did." <br> "All right!" Curly sounded resentful. "One more try. But this time I'll make sure we succeed!" <br> "Don't come see me unless it's late at night," the other voice said. "If you leave a message, make sure it's in our secret code." <br> "Sure, sure." It was plain Curly didn't like the orders. His face still turned toward the end of the train, he stepped away from the railing, moving closer to Kate. <br> Filled with panic, she scrambled into the hallway. When she reached the water cooler, she stopped as though planning to take a drink. <br> As she carefully looked back, a man's hand reached out, pushing the door to the platform farther open. Turning, Kate hurried up the aisle past the seats filled with sleeping people. <br> Halfway through the car, Kate glanced around. No one seemed to be following her. Just the same, she felt relieved when she reached Anders and Erik again. Dropping into her seat, she reached forward and tugged her brother's arm. "Anders! Wake up!" <br> Her brother groaned. <br> "Anders!" Kate's whisper sounded hoarse. <br> As though brushing off a pesky fly, Anders swung his arm, almost hitting Kate's face. <br> "Anders!" Kate was angry now. "It's important!" <br> "Shhh!" someone hissed from across the aisle. "We're trying to sleep!" <br> Desperately, Kate kicked her brother's foot. When Anders still didn't waken, she shook Erik's shoulder. "I need help!" she whispered.</p><h2>A Separate Reality: Further Conversations with Don Juan</h2><p>The author chronicles his efforts to expand his consciousness and increase his awareness of life through his apprenticeship to an Indian sorcerer</p><p>Born in 1925 in Peru, anthropologist <b>Carlos Castaneda</b> wrote a total of 15 books, which sold 8 million copies worldwide and were published in 17 different languages.

After graduating from college in New York, he joined the Marine Corps and served in Vietnam as an officer and helicopter gunship pilot. Following the war, he went to work in sales for Xerox Corporation and, in 1977, started a company that brought the first nylon and Velcro ?surfer&#x201d; wallets to market. He founded an international education company in 1985 that taught business and investing to tens of thousands of students throughout the world. In 1994, he sold his business and, through his investments, was able to retire at the age of forty-seven. During his short-lived retirement, he wrote <i>Rich Dad, Poor Dad</i> and coauthored <i>Why We Want You To Be Rich</i> with Donald Trump. He lives in Arizona.<p>www.richdad.com</p>Kiyosaki draws upon the counsel of 21 of his closest big business pals to prepare his audience to properly assess property values, locate foreclosures, lower taxes and even find hidden investment opportunities. The book couldn't come at a more appropriate time, given the rising number of home foreclosures, and luckily seasoned narrators Jim Bond, Sandra Burr and Bruce Reizen make listening an enjoyable and personable experience. Many such guides fail to reach listeners because of their less than inspired narrations; this talented cast not only injects life into their respective readings, but also manage to get the point across without sounding the least bit robotic. <i>A Vanguard paperback (Reviews, May 25).

Instead, our brains link with those of the people close to us, in a silent rhythm that makes up the very life force of the body. These wordless and powerful ties determine our moods, stabilize and maintain our health and well-being, and change the structure of our brains. In consequence, who we are and who we become depend, in great part, on whom we love.<br><br><b>A General Theory of Love</b> applies these and other extraordinary insights to some of the most crucial issues we face in our lives. Its authors explain how relationships function and where love goes wrong, how parents shape a child's developing self, how psychotherapy really works, what curbs and what fosters violent aggression in our children, and how modern society regularly courts disaster by flouting emotional laws it does not yet recognize.<br><br>A work of rare originality, passion, and eloquence, <b>A General Theory of Love</b> will forever change the way you think about human intimacy.<br></p><p>Poor, poor science--it gets blamed for everything. While it might be true that some of our alienation and unhappiness stem from a too-rational misunderstanding of emotion, it's also true that science is its own remedy. <i>A General Theory of Love</i>, by San Francisco psychiatrists Thomas Lewis, Fari Amini, and Richard Lannon, is a powerfully humanistic look at the natural history of our deepest feelings, and why a simple hug is often more important than a portfolio full of stock options. Their grasp of neural science is topnotch, but the book is more about humans as social animals and how we relate to others--for once, the brain plays second fiddle to the heart.<p> Though some of their social analysis is less than fully thought out--surely e-mail isn't a truly unique form of communication, as they suggest--the work as a whole is strong and merits attention. Science, it turns out, does have much to say about our messy feelings and relationships. While much of it could be filed under "common sense," it's nice to know that common sense is replicable. Hard-science types will probably be exasperated with the constant shifts between data and appeals to emotional truths, but the rest of us will see in <i>A General Theory of Love</i> a new synthesis of research and poetry. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p>"A revolutionary book. In the tradition of Lewis Thomas, its authors transform hard science into page-turning lyricism. Every page provokes a shock of recognition as we see why the sources of our happiness lie far deeper in our brains than material goods, traditional psychotherapy, or self-help books have the power to reach. A reference book on life, this work deserves to be read and reread. It goes to the heart of what it means to be human."<br>--Madeline Levine, Ph.D., author of See No Evil: A Guide to Protecting Our Children from Media Violence<br>"Advancing a thesis as exciting in its way as Einstein's general theory of relativity, A General Theory of Love forges a wealth of fresh scientific research into a coherent thesis about the role of intimacy in our lives that is as eloquent as it is persuasive."<p><br>--Leonard Shlain, M.D., author of The Alphabet Versus the Goddess and Art &amp; Physics<br>"A new and exciting integration of insights from many fields, A General Theory of Love provides an original understanding of human behavior.

The authors explain the biological reasons behind what we already know in our hearts: Our need for love is wired deeply within us, and from infancy to old age our happiness depends upon receiving it.

It is a work of history on a grand scale, at once sweeping and detailed, closely reasoned and passionately argued, that succeeds in painting an unforgettable picture--alive with conspirators and philosophers, utopians and nihilists--of the making of the modern world.</p><p>EDMUND WILSON (1895&#x2013;1972) is widely regarded as the preeminent American man of letters of the twentieth century. Over his long career, he wrote for <i>Vanity Fair</i>, helped edit <i>The New Republic</i>, served as chief book critic for <i>The New Yorker</i>, and was a frequent contributor to <i>The New York Review of Books</i>.

It was published in book form in 1940 although much of the material had previously appeared in The New Republic. The work discusses European socialism, anarchism, and various theories of revolution from their origins to their implementation. It presents ideas and writings of political theorists representing all aspects of socialist, anarchist, and what would later be known as communist thought, among them Jules Michelet, Henri de Saint-Simon, Robert Owen, Mikhail Bakunin, Anatole France, Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Leon Trotsky, and Vladimir Ilich Lenin--who arrived at Petrograd's (St. Petersburg's) Finland Station in 1917 to lead the Bolshevik revolution. -- <i>The Merriam-Webster Encyclopedia of Literature</i></p><h2>Ben and Me</h2><p>Amos, a poor church mouse, becomes Ben Franklin&#39;s cherished companion and valued advisor</p><p>In <i>A New and Astonishing Life Of Benjamin Franklin As Written by His Good Mouse AMOS,</i> young readers will discover that while the good Mr. Franklin got considerable credit, many of his most important contributions <i>really</i> originated with Amos, a less-than-humble rodent.

He was in Russia in 1917 and witnessed the Revolution, which he reported for the Manchester Guardian. After escaping to Scandinavia, he settled in the Lake District of England with his Russian wife where, in 1929, he wrote Swallows and Amazons. Thus began a writing career that has produced some of the best children s literature of all time.Alex Jennings performs this beloved classic of English children's literature in splendid fashion. His shaded character portrayals and enthusiastic narration make it clear that he loves the book. Published in 1930, Swallows and Amazons is about six children who sail, camp, and find timeless adventure during a holiday in England's Lake District. It is a literate book full of magic for children and adults, which Jennings's reading amplifies. The many characters are distinct individuals--from the Australian mom to a neighboring farm wife to serious older siblings and the head-over-heels enthusiastic younger kids. Jennings's pace quickens when the sailboat battles occur and relaxes when the children collapse around the fire. Listening, we lose ourselves in the golden days.

Equine therapist Linda Kohanov tells of an extraordinary spiritual awakening she experienced with her black mare, Rasa. This incident led her to investigate the apparent metaphysical as well as scientific aspects of the human-horse bond. Using neurological research, cultural history, mythology, and firsthand anecdotes from years of teaching and facilitating equine therapy, Kohanov examines the profound communion that people, and women in particular, often experience with horses. Some of the areas Kohanov explores are how the equine mind compares with the human mind, and what horses can teach humanity.</p><p><i>The Tao of Equus</i>, which literally translates as "the way of the horse," explores the possibility that horses are highly evolved, spiritual beings who offer humans opportunities for healing and personal growth. Linda Kohanov is the owner of Epona Equestrian Services, an Arizona-based collective of trainers and counselors that explore the therapeutic potential of equestrian pursuits. Although she does discuss horse training and horse behavior, Kohanov is most interested in what horses can teach us. Moving beyond the realm of horse whispering, Kohanov studies how horses awaken intuition in humans while also mirroring our unspoken feelings and fears. At its core, this book reminds us to be mindful as we approach the horse-human relationship. Like human-to-human relationships, we have to do our own personal and spiritual work before we can expect to create a meaningful and cooperative interspecies connection. Kohanov is a steadfast writer who isn't shy about claiming a strong feminine approach, showing how mythology and history are filled with examples of powerful woman-horse connections. She also has the courage to reveal her paranormal experiences with these intensely emotional and intuitive animals--stories that may sound familiar to anyone who has ever loved and dreamed of horses. <i>--Gail Hudson</i>"A startling challenge to anyone wishing to limit consciousness to humans."<br> -- <b>Larry Dossey, MD</b> <br><br> "Linda Kohanov's stories about the mystery of healing and transformation between human and horse are extraordinary, magical. Linda has done her homework, and her book stands well on its research, but it dances on its stories. A book that can change minds, hearts, and attitudes."<br> -- <b>Susan Chernak McElroy</b>, author of <i>Animals as Teachers and Healers</i> <br><br> "This work represents an extraordinarily moving account of a gifted thinker, writer, teacher, and horsewoman who dares to venture deep within to explore the truth of the connection that merges horse, human, emotion, and spirit."<br> -- <b><i>Riding</i></b> <br><br> "<i>The Tao of Equus</i> is part memoir, part literature, mythology, and philosophy lesson, and part psychology text. More than anything, [Linda Kohanov] had the courage to investigate dreams and visions many may dismiss. As you read, you'll ponder your own dreams and coincidences, and consider what your horse may be waiting to teach you."<br> -- <b><i>Horse &amp; Rider</i></b> <br><br> "This articulate, well-researched story brings together many disciplines of learning and weaves a magic carpet for discovery with our horses. <i>The Tao of Equus</i> will allow your imagination to take flight, and give you insight into yourself and your equine partner."<br> -- <b><i>The Equestrian News</i></b> <br><br> "This inspirational book would make an excellent gift not only for horse lovers, but for anyone dealing with fundamental questions of grief, sadness, and healing."<br> -- <b><i>BookPage</i></b> <br><br> "Effective psychotherapy 'contains' a mysterious energy that synchronously interweaves the interaction of therapist and client. Linda Kohanov takes us on a marvelous excursion of her evolutionary relationship with horses, highlighting equine-facilitated psychotherapy and the Tao energy that horses have to offer in the service of this work. I highly recommend this book to everyone interested in innovative psychotherapy and more than just a superficial look at horses."<br> -- <b>Fred P. Gallo, PhD</b>, author of <i>Energy Psychology</i>, <i>Energy Tapping</i>, and <i>Energy Psychology in Psychotherapy</i></p><h2>Encore Provence</h2><p>After trying--what folly!--to live in other places, Peter Mayle is back in his beloved Provence. He celebrates his homecoming by sharing with us a whole new feast of adventures, discoveries, hilarities, and culinary treats, liberally seasoned with a joyous mix of Gallic characters. The pauses for refreshment include an unforgettable meal in a converted gas station, a rendezvous with the very best bouillabaisse, and visits to eventful weekly markets.<br><br>But there is life after lunch, and we also discover a school for noses in Haute Provence, a gardener who grows black tomatoes, the secret of the oversexed butcher, a celebration of Alowine (Halloween) Provence-style, and the genetic effects of two thousand years of <i>fois gras.</i> There is a memorable tour of Marseille, a comprehensive lesson on olive oil, a search for the perfect cork-screw, and invaluable recommendations for splendid local cheeses, wines, honey, bread, country restaurants, and off-the-beaten-track places to stay.<br><br>Never has Peter Mayle written with more unabashed pleasure about his heaven on earth.</p><p>"Provence, again?" one may think, seeing Peter Mayle's latest effort. "Has the man nothing better to do than promote a region that's already overhyped and overpriced? Can't he turn his eye to a place that needs a touristic boost, like Bulgaria?"<p> However, there are reasons to plunge into the third Proven�al book by Englishman Mayle, formerly a Madison Avenue copywriter whose bestselling <i>A Year in Provence</i> made the area a must-see for tourists and helped to quadruple real estate prices there. After four years in Long Island, Mayle has returned to France with continuing adoration.</p><p> Mayle discloses a world missed by tourists, be it the questions dry cleaners ask about wine stains or the mysterious murder of a small-town butcher given to making housewives happy with more than his displayed meat. He also incorporates guide-like tips--listing markets, cheese makers, and the essential how-tos of perfume sniffing and olive-oil tasting. What's more, this book gives a peek into the life of a bestselling writer. The role is not always an enviable one.</p><p> Mayle no longer fits into life in America--the vocabulary alone is enough to throw him off--yet in Provence, he is regarded as little more than a moneyed foreigner. Speared by the British press, he laments, "One of my crimes is to have encouraged people to visit the region ... far too many people ... and people of the wrong sort," an accusation that he denies.</p><p> And Mayle comes off as positively defensive in his attack of former <i>New York Times</i> food critic Ruth Reichl, who wrote that she was disappointed in the region. The title alone of chapter 3 hints at the sarcastic stabbings to follow: "<i>New York Times</i> Restaurant Critic Makes Astonishing Discovery: Provence Never Existed." Page after page, he roasts Reichl on the spit, creating a hissing Ruth Rotisserie that's most unbecoming from someone of his stature. </p><p> What most causes him to sputter is Reichl's admission that she "had been dreaming of a Provence that never existed."</p><p> "Where had I been living all these years?" writes the man who's helped to perpetrate the illusion of a land that is nothing but lavender fields, sunflowers swaying in the breeze, and fascinating characters every millimeter. "The Provence that Daudet, Giono, Ford Madox Ford, Lawrence Durrell and M.F.K. Fisher knew and wrote about--the Provence that I know--doesn't exist.... It's a sunny figment of our imagination, a romanticized fantasy."</p><p> Maybe. Having recently visited Provence, I agree with Reichl's critical assessment. Therein lies Mayle's ultimate charm. Crack open a bottle of Chateauneuf du Pape, delve into <i>Encore Provence</i>, and voil�: it may be better than actually being there. <i>--Melissa Rossi</i></p>"Delightful, amusing, and appealing." -<i>New York Time Book Review<i></i></i></p><h2>Player's Handbook Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons (2nd Ed Fantasy Roleplaying)</h2><p>Outlines how to determine a character&#39;s abilities, rules for character improvement, and mapping and combat procedures</p><p></p><h2>I Am Spock</h2><p>Filled with behind-the-scenes anecdotes about his years on the <em>Star Trek</em> television series as the remorselessly logical Dr. Spock, the actor and director reflects on his relationship to his hugely popular character.</p><p>No Bio<br><br>No BioAs himself and his Vulcan alter ego, the author reads this memoir, a fascinating look at Nimoy&#39;s life, work and the well-known character who affected both. Listeners need not be &#34;Star Trek&#34; fans; a lot here deals with the universal topics of the creative process and self-integration. Nimoy gives a superlative performance, and the production has the feel of chatting with a friend. The abridgment captures the tone and flavor of the book, hitting all the important points. This work is an ideal choice for audio. One hears Nimoy&#39;s &#34;conversations&#34; with Spock, and the frank style of the book is well conveyed in his easy style of narration. M.A.M.

She lives in an adobe house in the high desert of the American Southwest beneath the big sky and among lizards, hummingbirds, and tumbleweeds.<p>Wishwind<br> &nbsp;<br> Danalong&#x2019;s nostrils flared with the scents of the ocean and his own blood. He staggered inland shedding droplets of seawater on the forest floor. Step by painful step, he was guided only by the pale gleam of moonlight.<br><br>Wet and racked by chills, he gasped for breath as if drowning, but he was on dry land. It was his comrades, his people, who had drowned. The sea had lashed out and the wind had twisted around, thrusting <i>Windswift </i>onto a hidden shelf, gutting it of cargo, crew, and soldiers. The cries and shouts, horses screaming as they spilled into the waves, the crack of masts as they splintered and toppled. The roar of ocean filling Danalong&#x2019;s ears. Swallowing great gulps of water, swirling in the waves, drowning, drowning . . .<br><br>Then his flailing hands had fallen upon a plank of wreckage that appeared out of the darkness like a gift bestowed upon him by the gods, and on this he floated to the shore of an unknown island. <br><br>The surging ocean had slammed him into barnacle- clad rocks that shredded hands, elbows, and knees. Now the cool night air stung the raw wounds.<br><br>He shoved aside tree limbs and crashed through underbrush with drunken momentum, driven inland by instinct, or some force he could not name. Abruptly the thick forest gave way and he stumbled into a moonlit clearing. A vision appeared before him of an ivory-haired woman singing of autumn apples to a fawn as its mother and a bobcat watched on.<br><i><br>Impossible! </i>he thought, and the world darkened.<br><br>Danalong thrashed in the water, waves crashing over his head. The current tried to pull him back under and fill his nose and mouth. The sea took young Jaren and Avery, and Drake and the others.<br>Drawn under one by one, their pale faces and limbs faded beneath the water&#x2019;s dark surface.<br><br>&#x201c;No!&#x201d; he cried and realized he wrestled with blankets and not the ocean. Sunshine and the scent of evergreens flowed through a window above where he lay on a coarse mattress and eased his panic. He was in a one-room croft of stone and the hearth crackled with a day fire. Dried herbs hung from the rafters above. A table laden with bread, honey, and berries occupied the center of the room. All else was obscured in contrasts of sunlight and shadow.<br><br>Might this be Coutre Harbor, he wondered, and the wreck no more than a nightmare? He listened for a time to the piping song of a thrush outside and the rustling of leaves in a breeze. No, not Coutre Harbor, he decided, which would be rank and noisy as a busy seaport always was. The wreck had been no nightmare. The <i>Windswift </i>was truly gone.<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; he whispered. He&#x2019;d been on a vital mission for King Jonaeus to gather Lord Arey&#x2019;s troops and lead them to the coast of Coutre, where intelligence said Mornhavon&#x2019;s forces planned an assault. If Mornhavon took the eastern provinces, it would cost the Sacor Clans the war, and all the years of suffering and slaughter would be for naught. Now with the ship&#x2019;s loss, the king would receive no reinforcements at all, for <i>Windswift&#x2019;s </i>sister ship, <i>Wishwind, </i>carrying additional troops and supplies, had vanished in a gale days ago.<br><br>He recalled strong currents and high waves as they approached the Northern Sea Archipelago. It had been the shipmaster&#x2019;s plan to use the islands to conceal their approach from Mornhavon&#x2019;s spies despite the archipelago&#x2019;s dangerous tides and currents. Even more perilous in the minds of some sailors was the archipelago&#x2019;s reputation for the uncanny. Rife in the dark berths of ships and the taverns of every port town were tales of witches casting spells over unwary mariners and sinking ships, and of the ancient sea kings who were said to slumber in island caves until they awoke once more to dominate the lands.<br><br>The shipmaster of <i>Windswift </i>scoffed at superstition and was confident in his ability to navigate the archipelago&#x2019;s hazards and the night&#x2019;s fickle winds. His miscalculation, however, not only cost countless lives aboard ship, but possibly the war itself.<br> <i><br>Both ships lost. No hope.</i><br><br>The croft&#x2019;s door opened, and the willowy, ivory-haired woman of Danalong&#x2019;s previous vision stepped inside and appraised him with granite- gray eyes.<br><br>&#x201c;You should eat, child,&#x201d; the woman said, and she gestured at the table.<br><br>&#x201c;Who are you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I am Marin. Eat. It is late noon and your stomach is empty.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I must go to the shore,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;We were wrecked&#x2014; my ship. I must help my people.&#x201d; Then he added more quietly, &#x201c;If any survive.&#x201d; He held little hope that any others had survived the violence of the sea.<br><br>&#x201c;Eat,&#x201d; Marin told him. &#x201c;If there are survivors, you are in no condition to aid them at the moment.&#x201d;<br><br>Danalong wrapped the blanket around himself for underneath he wore only his own skin. His clothes dried before the fire. When he sat at the table he just stared at the food unable to actually eat. Marin broke off a piece of bread and spread it with honey and placed it in his hand.<br><br>&#x201c;You must find your strength again. You are no good to anyone right now, Green Rider, least of all yourself.&#x201d;<br><br>He obeyed but did not taste the food. His mind was too full of the previous night&#x2019;s disaster and wondering about this Marin woman who seemed to know who, or at least what, he was, though his green cloak and winged horse brooch would&#x2019;ve given that away. Still, her manner was <i>knowing. </i>He felt no threat from her, but found her penetrating gaze and silence uncomfortable.<br><br>Finally, when he finished, Marin spoke. &#x201c;Your clothes are dry if you choose to wear them.&#x201d;<br><br>He hadn&#x2019;t much hope for his uniform to be in any condition to wear, but discovered the tunic and trousers had been stitched and patched, and the cloak was in fine shape. Once dressed, he exhaled in relief, feeling more himself.<br><br>Marin led him outside for fresh air. The croft, cloaked by flower-specked vines, sat by a lake. It was as placid as the sea had been furious.<br><br>Marin scurried to and fro inspecting flowers and trees, chattering to them like old friends. Danalong followed slowly and stiffly, shoulders erect and hands clasped behind his back. He wondered how this Marin woman had come to live on this island the charts indicated was uninhabited, and found her obvious joy in the surrounding nature eccentric.<br><br>Danalong had been born into war, had grown up in an orphan camp, his own face mirrored in those of the other children&#x2014;pinched with starvation as they were forced to fletch arrows, or labor in forges and tanneries in service to the war effort. When they grew strong enough to wield the weapons they made, they were sent off to fight. Child warriors returned as grim veterans missing limbs and eyes, haunted by all they had witnessed. If they returned at all.<br><br>To Danalong, nature was important only in how it affected troop movements and strategy, how it could prove an advantage or disadvantage in a given battle. How it could sustain armies. In and of itself, he had given it little consideration, and the only flowers he ever noticed were those placed on graves.<br><br>&#x201c;I heard how the ocean carried you ashore.&#x201d; Marin could have been speaking to the trillium blossom she cupped in her hand.<br><br>&#x201c;My people . . . &#x201d; Their screams echoed like a fresh wound in Danalong&#x2019;s mind. All he could see were bodies with familiar faces floating among the wreckage.<br><br>&#x201c;It happens.&#x201d; Marin sighed. &#x201c;Your shipmaster misjudged the wind.&#x201d;<br><br>Danalong clawed back a wisp of hair. &#x201c;The wind turned on us.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t blame the wind, child,&#x201d; was the gentle reply. &#x201c;It is not the first time nor the last. I know that you&#x2019;re worried about the war now that those on the battlefront will be denied aid against the invaders. You are angry because among their leader&#x2019;s atrocities against your people, he burned the woodlands of your coastal home. A pity, for those were ancient and goodly trees.&#x201d;<br><br>They had been Danalong&#x2019;s only refuge as a child. &#x201c;How do you know so much?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I hear and see things.&#x201d;<br> <i><br>Sea witch, </i>Danalong thought. She had to be. Why else would she be living on this island? She must scry for her knowledge with magic. He had felt no threat from her, but now he gazed after her in suspicion as she continued along the path. Maybe she was even one of Mornhavon&#x2019;s sorcerers and she had actually caused the demise of both ships. He knew magic only as a weapon, and, among the Green Riders, his was the deadliest of all.<br><br>A sudden unearthly cry stopped him in his tracks. He reached in reflex for a sword that was not there, a sword he&#x2019;d thrown into the ocean along with his armor so they would not drag him down into the depths.<br><br>&#x201c;The loon is back!&#x201d; Marin pointed to the near shore of the lake.<br><br>A loon. Of course. Danalong relaxed. Loons were rare on the mainland for war had ravaged much that had been beautiful, including the lakes.<br><br>The loon floated low in the water among reeds, then dove without so much as a splash.<br><br>&#x201c;He has just returned from winter on the ocean.&#x201d; Marin gazed long at the lake, her eyes distant. <br>&#x201c;Ancient is the loon&#x2019;s kind. They knew this land long before humankind ever stepped foot upon it. Before even the Eletians. And while other creatures may pass from existence and memory, the loons remain, surviving many millennia, no matter the travails of the lands.&#x201d;<br><br>The loon reappeared farther down the lake and called out again, a haunting sound.<br><br>&#x201c;And sometimes I think,&#x201d; Marin continued, &#x201c;they were gifted with the voice to express the loneliness of the ages in a way we cannot.&#x201d;<br><br>They lingered by the lake with its plash of waves and the fresh scent of spring growth. Serenity enveloped Danalong, but then he frowned and shook himself as if from a spell. The lulling quality of the lake had distracted him from the tragedy of the <i>Windswift. </i>How could he stand here in this beautiful place when his companions had perished? And yet, he could not express his sorrow. He learned as a child that tears would never bring back his family or friends, and had since hardened himself against weeping.<br> <i><br>I can only honor the lost and redeem myself in battle, </i>he thought. His way was to seek vengeance, but it brought only bitter solace. And one question recurred after every battle, and now after the shipwreck: <i>Couldn&#x2019;t I have saved some of them? </i>His special magical ability was of no help when it came to <i>saving </i>lives.<br><br>&#x201c;It may seem harsh,&#x201d; Marin said as if reading Danalong&#x2019;s thoughts, &#x201c;but life is for survivors.&#x201d;<br> Danalong turned on Marin. &#x201c;You would say that after all I&#x2019;ve lost? The wreck, friends killed in the fighting? Lives lost because the invaders want our land and resources? Mornhavon tortures and enslaves the innocent.&#x201d;<br><br>Marin sighed heavily. A breeze rippled across the lake. Cattails tossed in its wake and poplar leaves quaked. The air cooled as dusk gathered, and a full moon rose milky white to bob above the treetops.<br><br>Danalong still faced Marin, awaiting a response, his body rigid. The wisp of hair now clung damply to his forehead. Shadows grew long before Marin answered.<br><br>&#x201c;I do not lean toward the ways of those like Mornhavon. There have been many such as he through the ages of this world, but like all else, they&#x2019;ve crumbled to dust with time. They fight for dominance as eaglets in the nest, the strongest killing its sibling. Survival.&#x201d; Marin clasped Danalong&#x2019;s hand. &#x201c;Child, you are a survivor. You survived a shipwreck and the violence of the sea. Tomorrow we shall garden, and then maybe you will understand.&#x201d;<br><br>Gardening? When he had survivors to look for? He also needed to reach the king to warn him no aid would be arriving from Arey.<br><br>&#x201c;I appreciate your help,&#x201d; he told Marin. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been very kind. But, as much as I&#x2019;d like to. . . garden, I&#x2019;ve survivors to search for. And might you have a boat? I must reach King Jonaeus. It is quite urgent.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The young ones are always in such haste.&#x201d; She clucked her tongue. &#x201c;Child, the healing of wounds takes time, and there is no better salve than gardening.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;As for a boat?&#x201d; She chuckled. &#x201c;Now what would <i>I </i>do with a boat?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But I need to&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hush, child. Tomorrow we garden.&#x201d;<br><br>A warmth seemed to radiate from Marin that soothed Danalong&#x2019;s fury. Yes, wounds needed healing. He exhaled a deep breath, and watched in fascination as she turned her palm upward and a star seemed to settle on it to light the way.</p></p><h2>The Balkan Trilogy (The Great Fortune / The Spoilt City / Friends and Heroes)</h2><p>Miranda&#39;s life is starting to unravel.

She married just before World War II and went to live in Bucharest with her husband. Her experience there formed the basis of the work that makes up <b>The Balkan Trilogy</b>. As the Germans approached Athens, she and her husband evacuated to Egypt and ended up in Jeruslam where her husband worked at the Palestine Broadcasting Station. They returned to London in 1946 and lived there until her death in 1980.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>Series of three novels by Olivia Manning, first published together posthumously in 1981. Consisting of The Great Fortune (1960), The Spoilt City (1962), and Friends and Heroes (1965), the trilogy is a semiautobiographical account of a British couple living in the Balkans during World War II. The complex narrative, composed of several different voices, is noted for its vivid historicity. In The Great Fortune, newlyweds Guy and Harriet Pringle encounter an increasingly fascist environment in Bucharest, Romania, in 1939. Guy is a gregarious university lecturer whose liberal views contrast with those of his reserved wife. Clarence Lawson is a colleague of Guy who worships him and finds Harriet attractive. In The Spoilt City, Harriet faces marital problems and befriends Sasha Drucker, a Romanian army deserter, and Prince Yakimov, a Russian emigre. Just before the arrival of German troops in Bucharest, Guy sends Harriet to Greece, where they are reunited in Friends and Heroes. Guy acquires a teaching post and becomes involved in communist politics. By the end of the novel, the Pringles repair their marriage and flee to Cairo, where their story is continued in The Levant Trilogy. -- <i>The Merriam-Webster Encyclopedia of Literature</i></p><h2>Bodhisattva of Compassion: The Mystical Tradition of Kuan Yin (Shambhala Dragon Editions)</h2><p>This portrait of the Buddhist embodiment of compassion is both an informative study by a leading scholar of Buddhism and an engaging account of the author's search for the mystical significance of the goddess. An object of joyous devotion in Chinese folk religion, Kuan Yin is revered for her saving power: it is said that anyone in distress who calls on her with sincerity will be rescued from suffering and harm. On a deeper level, Kuan Yin symbolizes the liberating energy of compassion, which is an indispensable aid in the quest for enlightenment. <br><br>John Blofeld evokes the charming presence of Kuan Yin through colorful anecdotes, personal experiences, and descriptions of Buddhist rituals and legends encountered during his travels throughout China. At the same time, he offers a learned account of the goddess's history and importance in Chinese thought and religion. He explores the origin of the Bodhisattva of Compassion in India and Tibet, in the form of Avalokiteshvara (Tibetan: Chenresig), a male deity who evolved into the gentle mother/maiden figure of Chinese Buddhism. Meditation and visualization techniques associated with Kuan Yin are given, and her principal iconographic forms are described. Illustrated with images from Chinese and Tibetan sacred art, the book also contains translations of devotional poems and yogic texts. <i>Bodhisattva of Compassion </i> is undoubtedly the most complete and illuminating picture of Kuan Yin available.</p><p>vokes the charming presence of the Goddess of Compassion through colorful anecdotes and descriptions of rituals and legends.John Blofeld (1913&#x2013;1987) was a world-renowned scholar and writer who devoted his life to the study of Eastern religion, especially Taoism and Buddhism.</p><h2>The American Miracle: Divine Providence in the Rise of the Republic</h2><p><b>Bestselling author and radio host Michael Medved recounts some of the most significant events in America&#x2019;s rise to prosperity and power, from the writing of the Constitution to the Civil War.

The eerie events of that epochal Independence Day suggested the intervention of supernatural forces, mixing death and dedication in such powerful ways that observers of all faiths, and of no faith, saw evidence of destiny&#x2019;s direction in American affairs. Even now, after nearly two hundred years of turbulent history, recollections of that &#x201c;Glorious Fourth&#x201d; can compel the most skeptical scholars to acknowledge weird, wonderful aspects in the rise of the Republic, and to reconsider the disconcerting old idea that God shows special tenderness toward the American experiment.</p><p>On the occasion of the fiftieth Fourth of July, such confidence in providential protection seemed not only logical but unavoidable. After all, the older citizens of the federal Union had already witnessed a half century of miracles, highlighted by the new nation&#x2019;s prodigious growth and unprecedented prosperity. Americans viewed themselves as a chosen people, selected for special responsibilities to accompany their special blessings, and so looked to biblical references to establish the proper context for major public celebrations.</p><p>The preparations for the anniversary repeatedly invoked the Old Testament notion of jubilee, citing a well-known verse in Leviticus: &#x201c;And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year and proclaim liberty throughout all the land and unto all the inhabitants thereof; it shall be a jubilee unto you&#x201d; (25:10). After all, a portion of this same verse had been inscribed onto the Liberty Bell itself--already a cherished national icon just two generations after it reputedly rang out in Philadelphia&#x2019;s Independence Hall to celebrate signing of the Declaration.</p><p>A half century later, leaders in every corner of the country arranged for pealing bells in cities, villages, and crossroads churches, in recognition of the breathtaking growth of the young Republic. The most recent census showed almost twelve million inhabitants--nearly five times the population that had launched a world-changing revolution. Even more dramatic, a loose coalition of thirteen thinly settled colonies, clinging to a relatively narrow band of territory at the edge of the Atlantic, had given way to twenty-four flourishing states with plausible dreams of an American empire someday reaching all the way to the Pacific.</p><p>In the midst of this dizzying change, Americans of the era clung to their precious remaining connections to the nation&#x2019;s heroic origins, expressing special gratitude for the unlikely survival of the two titans who had played the most prominent roles in declaring independence. At a time when male life expectancy barely reached forty years, John Adams, the &#x201c;Atlas of Independence&#x201d; and the second president of the United States, had passed his ninetieth birthday with his faculties and health remarkably intact. From his ancestral home outside of Boston, he watched with passionate engagement as his oldest son (and intellectual soul mate) presided over the government in faraway Washington as the sixth president. In fact, one of the former chief executive&#x2019;s doctors reported that the inauguration of his son in 1825 actually enhanced the old man&#x2019;s strength and vitality. &#x201c;But physicians do not always consider how much the powers of the mind, and what is called good spirits, can recover the lost energies of the body,&#x201d; wrote Benjamin Waterhouse to President John Quincy Adams. &#x201c;I really believe that your father&#x2019;s revival is mainly owing to the demonstration that his son has not served an ungrateful public.&#x201d;</p><p>Six hundred miles away, at the elegant hilltop plantation house he had designed for himself, Adams&#x2019;s old friend (and sometime bitter rival) Thomas Jefferson also defied the actuarial tables. At eighty-three, the third president struggled with various digestive and urinary tract afflictions, but he received frequent visitors and maintained a prolific correspondence, commenting eloquently on current affairs. He told his grandson that &#x201c;I am like an old watch, with a pinion worn out here, and a wheel there, until I can go no longer.&#x201d; He also carefully prepared for his own demise, penning a valedictory poem to his adored surviving daughter, enclosing it in a simple, elegant box she opened only after his death:</p><p>Then farewell, my dear, my lov&#x2019;d daughter, adieu!</p><p>The last pang of life is in parting from you!</p><p>Yet even with his intensifying focus on his own mortality, Jefferson expressed a fierce determination to survive one more Fourth of July so that &#x201c;he might breathe the air of the Fiftieth Anniversary.&#x201d;</p><p>As the great day approached, organizers of the elaborate public festivities in all of the nation&#x2019;s most important cities turned their attention to Adams and Jefferson as potential guests to lend historic weight to their celebrations. In the Continental Congress of 1776, it had been Adams who led the relentless fight for independence and who, once he had succeeded, recommended his young friend Jefferson to draft the declaration that would explain the decision to a wondering world. Now, of the fifty-six patriots who had affixed their signatures to that final document, only these two and one more--eighty-eight-year-old Charles Carroll of Maryland--were alive to see the half-century commemoration of their handiwork.</p><p>Despite pleas from every corner of the country, frail health and the rigors of travel made the journey unthinkable for each of the old men. Adams would have dearly loved to join his son at the White House to preside together over the capital&#x2019;s Grand Jubilee, but a journey to Washington would have consumed more than five days, rattling over rough roads in stiflingly hot stagecoaches and making brief water passages on belching, filthy steamboats.</p><p>Instead, he received visitors in the sprawling, comfortably cluttered two-story Quincy residence, Peacefield, he had called home since 1788. He had inhabited the house for the quarter century since disillusioned voters turned him out of the White House after his single term, following an exceptionally nasty and painfully personal campaign waged against him by followers of Jefferson, his old friend. Adams and his wife, Abigail, first acquired the structure and its forty acres of verdant fields and orchards at the conclusion of his diplomatic service in Europe following the Revolution; it stood just down a country road from the modest saltbox home in which he had been born and raised, and from the similarly unassuming neighboring structure in which his son John Quincy first opened his eyes to the New England sunlight. The old man still owned both buildings and hoped to keep them in the family for perpetuity. His beloved Abigail had left him a widower eight years before with her reported last words, &#x201c;Do not grieve, my friend, my dearest friend. I am ready to go. And John, it will not be long.&#x201d; She rested now in the local churchyard, where her husband of fifty-four years meant to join her when his time came.</p><p>Leaders from Boston hoped to lure the old lion to the festive commemorations they had planned in the nearby city, but Adams declined to make the ten-mile trip. He even turned down the local Independence Day committee from Quincy, though he provided them with a sharply worded letter they could read aloud at the upcoming anniversary. He wrote: &#x201c;My best wishes, in the joys, and festivities, and the solemn services of that day on which will be completed the fiftieth year from its birth, of the independence of the United States: a memorable epoch in the annals of the human race, destined in future history to form the brightest or the blackest page, according to the use or the abuse of those political institutions by which they shall, in time to come, be shaped by the human mind.&#x201d;</p><p>The committee of his neighbors, perhaps hoping that the great man would reconsider his participation in commemorations so close to his home, came calling at Peacefield a few days later. They asked Adams to suggest a toast that could be presented in his honor on the holiday. &#x201c;I will give you,&#x201d; he said without hesitation, &#x201c;independence forever.&#x201d;</p><p>After a moment of silence, his respectful visitors asked if he might consider adding something further. He leaned on his cane and scowled back at them from under his halo of white hair. &#x201c;Not a word,&#x201d; he crisply replied.<br><br></p><p>&#x201c;RAYS OF RAVISHING LIGHT AND GLORY&#x201d;</p><p>His friend Thomas Jefferson felt no similar reluctance to discourse at length. When Mayor Roger Weightman of Washington, D.C., invited all living former presidents--Adams, Jefferson, James Madison, and James Monroe--to attend the festival planned for the seat of government, each respectfully declined, citing the infirmities of age. The &#x201c;Sage of Monticello,&#x201d; however, carefully composed a public response that promptly appeared in newspapers around the country and created a national sensation in the weeks before the holiday. He wrote at a desk in his sun-dappled chamber, where a plaster bust of Adams rested on a shelf and overlooked his colleague&#x2019;s work with assumed approbation. Jefferson wrote:</p><p>I should, indeed, with peculiar delight, have met and exchanged there congratulations, personally, with the small band, the remnant of that host of worthies who joined with us on that day, in the bold and doubtful election we were to make, for our country, between submission and the sword; and to have enjoyed with them the consolatory fact that our fellow citizens, after half a century of experience and prosperity, continue to approve the choice we made. May it be to the world, what I believe it will be, (to some parts sooner, to others later, but finally to all) the signal of arousing men to burst the chains, under which monkish ignorance and superstition had persuaded them to bind themselves, and to assume the blessings and security of self-government. The form which we have substituted restores the free right to the unbounded exercise of reason and freedom of opinion. All eyes are opened or opening to the rights of men. The general spread of the light of science has already laid open to every view the palpable truth, that the mass of mankind has not been born with saddles on their backs, nor a favored few, booted and spurred, ready to ride them legitimately, by the grace of God. These are grounds of hope for others; for ourselves, let the annual return of this day forever refresh our recollection of these rights, and an undiminished devotion to them.<br><br></p><p>With this elegantly crafted testament of faith in the work of his own Revolutionary cohort, Jefferson managed, as he always did, to upstage his old friend. Even John Adams&#x2019;s son, the president of the United States, read Jefferson&#x2019;s words and pronounced himself impressed by the elderly Virginian&#x2019;s vigor of language and clarity of mind.</p><p>But it had been the elder Adams, not the more effusive Jefferson, who first predicted the way a grateful nation would come to rejoice over their bold gamble on nationhood. In an exultant letter to his wife, Abigail, back home in Boston, the irascible and tireless patriot had described a fateful day of decision at the Continental Congress in Philadelphia in 1776 and then recorded an uncanny burst of prophecy, shockingly typical of our founding fathers. The delegate from Massachusetts declared that the second day of July, when his congressional colleagues first voted to authorize permanent separation from the mother country, would become known as&nbsp;the most memorable epocha in the history of America. I am apt to believe that it will be celebrated by succeeding generations as the great anniversary festival. It ought to be commemorated as the day of deliverance, by solemn acts of devotion to God Almighty. It ought to be solemnized with pomp and parade, with shows, games, sports, guns, bells, bonfires and illuminations from one end of this continent to another, from this time forward forevermore. You will think me transported with enthusiasm but I am not. I am well aware of the toil and blood and treasure it will cost us to maintain this Declaration and to support and defend these states. Yet through all the gloom, I can see rays of ravishing light and glory.<br><br></p><p>REJECTING MR. JEFFERSON&#x2019;S &#x201c;SEDITIOUS PAPER&#x201d;</p><p>Unfortunately, it took more than a generation for those rays to shine in a healing, benevolent fashion on the implacably warring factions that afflicted the new nation. To a startling extent, partisanship undermined the development of a national holiday and even spoiled appreciation of the Declaration, which was indelibly associated with its principal author, Jefferson, a profoundly controversial figure for most of his political career. The Federalists who controlled the national government between 1789 and 1801 felt no inclination to honor Jefferson&#x2019;s masterpiece, considering its language too explicitly anti-British and suspiciously, if vaguely, pro-French. On July 4, 1800, two ministers ostentatiously walked out of a public worship service honoring independence when one of their young students insisted on reading aloud from Mr. Jefferson&#x2019;s &#x201c;seditious paper.&#x201d;</p><p>Within a year, one of the most vitriolic elections in American history brought the Jeffersonians into full control in the capital. The new president delivered a famously conciliatory inaugural address, attempting to defuse wild talk of disunion and resistance from some of the indignant Adams loyalists. &#x201c;Every difference of opinion is not a difference of principle,&#x201d; Thomas Jefferson declared. &#x201c;We have called by different names brethren of the same principle. We are all Republicans, we are all Federalists.&#x201d; Nevertheless, his triumphal followers displayed a fervent determination to exclude their vanquished foes from their strictly partisan Fourth of July balls and banquets, much as they themselves had been excluded in previous years.</p><p>Only with the presidency of James Monroe (1817&#x2013;25) did the nation finally welcome the &#x201c;Era of Good Feelings,&#x201d; in which even the most strident politicos could put aside contempt for the opposition long enough to jointly fire cannon, march in flag-waving parades, gorge themselves at public banquets, and toast the Republic with brimming silver bowls of rum in community-wide celebrations of Independence Day. In part, this development reflected the disappearance of the most divisive issue of America&#x2019;s early years: the ongoing world war between Britain and France in which competing U.S. factions took opposite sides. With Napoleon&#x2019;s definitive defeat in 1815, the old Federalists and their heirs had no more reason to fear the rampages of imperial or revolutionary France, just as Jefferson&#x2019;s Democratic-Republican minions felt less inclination toward bitterness against the globally victorious British Empire they had battled in both a bloody revolution and the War of 1812. Monroe won reelection with no organized opposition, and during his second term even aging political warriors, most notably Adams and Jefferson, began to embrace the idea that their common values and shared experiences counted for more than ideological distinctions or colliding ambitions</p><p>After all, the most discerning among them understood that the rising Republic faced more dangerous divisions than...</p></p><h2>The Unthinkable: Who Survives When Disaster Strikes - and Why</h2><p>It lurks in the corner of our imagination, almost beyond our ability to see it: the possibility that a tear in the fabric of life could open up without warning, upending a house, a skyscraper, or a civilization. <br><br>Today, nine out of ten Americans live in places at significant risk of earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, terrorism, or other disasters. Tomorrow, some of us will have to make split-second choices to save ourselves and our families. How will we react? What will it feel like? Will we be heroes or victims? Will our upbringing, our gender, our personality&#x2013;anything we&#x2019;ve ever learned, thought, or dreamed of&#x2013;ultimately matter?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Amanda Ripley, an award-winning journalist for <i>Time</i> magazine who has covered some of the most devastating disasters of our age, set out to discover what lies beyond fear and speculation. In this magnificent work of investigative journalism, Ripley retraces the human response to some of history&#x2019;s epic disasters, from the explosion of the Mont Blanc munitions ship in 1917&#x2013;one of the biggest explosions before the invention of the atomic bomb&#x2013;to a plane crash in England in 1985 that mystified investigators for years, to the journeys of the 15,000 people who found their way out of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. Then, to understand the science behind the stories, Ripley turns to leading brain scientists, trauma psychologists, and other disaster experts, formal and informal, from a Holocaust survivor who studies heroism to a master gunfighter who learned to overcome the effects of extreme fear. <br><br>Finally, Ripley steps into the dark corners of her own imagination, having her brain examined by military researchers and experiencing through realistic simulations what it might be like to survive a plane crash into the ocean or to escape a raging fire. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Ripley comes back with precious wisdom about the surprising humanity of crowds, the elegance of the brain&#x2019;s fear circuits, and the stunning inadequacy of many of our evolutionary responses. Most unexpectedly, she discovers the brain&#x2019;s ability to do much, much better, with just a little help.<br><br><i>The Unthinkable</i> escorts us into the bleakest regions of our nightmares, flicks on a flashlight, and takes a steady look around. Then it leads us home, smarter and stronger than we were before.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how you would react to a disaster? Do you think you would be paralysed with fear, like the diplomat who froze, drink still in hand, as terrorists invaded the Dominican Republic�s embassy in Colombia in 1980? Or might you find yourself pretending it hadn�t happened, like the 9/11 survivor whose first instinct on feeling the shockwaves of the plane crashing into her building was to stay put? Or then again might you suddenly find hidden strengths in yourself, like Joe Stiley, who not only escaped from a dreadful plane wreck, but also managed to survive thirty minutes in the freezing Potomac river waiting for rescue vehicles to arrive? <p>In The Unthinkable award-winning journalist Amanda Ripley talks to risk analysts, psychologists and survivors of some of the most harrowing catastrophes in history in order to piece together how people react in a crisis and why they behave the way they do. She demonstrates that responses ranging from paralysed shock through to frenzied action can be clearly categorised and explained, as can the stages through which most people go when suddenly faced with a disaster � initial denial, cautious deliberation, final decision.She compellingly shows how the rational and irrational parts of our brains interact when put under pressure, and she also reveals the physical effects of sudden stress. And finally she demonstrates that while our reactions are often instinctive and inbuilt, we can also be taught how to master or control them. </p> <p>We all have a �disaster personality� that reveals itself at moments of crisis. In The Unthinkable you can become acquainted with yours .Who knows? One day, understanding how it works may save your life.</p>When the first plane hit the World Trade Center on 9/11, many office workers stayed at their desks.

He worked as an aeronautical engineer and published his first novel, Marazan, in 1926. In 1931 he married Frances Mary Heaton and they went on to have two daughters. During the Second World War he joined the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve where he worked on developing secret weapons. After the war he continued to write and settled in Australia where he lived until his death on 12 January 1960. His most celebrated novels include Pied Piper (1942), No Highway (1948), A Town Like Alice (1950) and On the Beach (1957).I<br><br>James Macfadden died in March 1905 when he was forty-seven years old; he was riding in the Driffield Point-to-Point. He left the bulk of his money to his son Douglas. The Macfaddens and the Dalhousies at that time lived in Perth, and Douglas was a school friend of Jock Dalhousie, who was a young man then, and had gone to London to become junior partner in a firm of solicitors in Chancery Lane, Owen, Dalhousie, and Peters. I am now the senior partner, and Owen and Dalhousie and Peters have been dead for many years, but I never changed the name of the firm.<br><br>It was natural that Douglas Macfadden should put his affairs into the hands of Jock Dalhousie, and Mr Dalhousie handled them personally till he died in 1928. In splitting up the work I took Mr Macfadden on to my list of clients, and forgot about him in the pressure of other matters.<br><br>It was not until 1935 that any business for him came up. I had a letter from him then, from an address in Ayr. He said that his brother-in-law, Arthur Paget, had been killed in a motor car accident in Malaya and so he wanted to redraft his will to make a trust in favour of his sister Jean and her two children. I am sorry to say that I was so ignorant of this client that I did not even know he was unmarried and had no issue of his own. He finished up by saying that he was too unwell to travel down to London, and he suggested that perhaps a junior member of the firm might be sent up to see him and arrange the matter.<br><br>This fitted in with my arrangements fairly well, because when I got this letter I was just leaving for a fortnight's fishing holiday on Loch Shiel. I wrote and told him that I would visit him on my way south, and I put the file concerning his affairs in the bottom of my suitcase to study one evening during my vacation.<br><br>When I got to Ayr I took a room at the Station Hotel, because in our correspondence there had been no suggestion that he could put me up. I changed out of my plus-fours into -a dark business suit, and went to call upon my client.<br><br>He did not live at all in the manner I had expected. I did not know much about his estate except that it was probably well over twenty thousand pounds, and I had expected to find my client living in a house with a servant or two. Instead, I discovered that he had a bedroom and a sitting-room on the same floor of a small private hotel just off the sea front. He was evidently leading the life of an invalid though he was hardly more than fifty years old at that time, ten years younger than I was myself. He was as frail as an old lady of eighty, and he had a peculiar grey look about him which didn't look at all good to me. All the windows of his sitting-room were shut and after the clean air of the lochs and moors I found his room stuffy and close; he had a number of budgerigars in cages in the window, and the smell of these birds made the room very unpleasant. It was clear from the furnishings that he had lived in that hotel and in that room for a good many years.<br><br>He told me something about his life as we discussed the will; he was quite affable, and pleased that I had been able to come to visit him myself. He seemed to be an educated man, though he spoke with a marked Scots accent. 'I live very quietly, Mr Strachan,' he said. 'My health will not permit me to go far abroad. Whiles I get out upon the front on a fine day and sit for a time, and then again Maggie - that's the daughter of Mrs Doyle who keeps the house - Maggie wheels me out in the chair. They are very good to me here.'<br><br>Turning to the matter of the will, he told me that he had no close relatives at all except his sister, Jean Paget. 'Forbye my father might have left what you might call an indiscretion or two in Australia,' he said. 'I would not say that there might not be some of those about, though I have never met one, or corresponded. Jean told me once that my mother had been sore distressed. Women talk about these things, of course, and my father was a lusty type of man.'<br><br>His sister Jean had been an officer in the WAACs in the 1914-1918 War, and she had married a Captain Paget in the spring of 1917. 'It was not a very usual sort of marriage,' he said thoughtfully. 'You must remember that my sister Jean had never been out of Scotland till she joined the army, and the greater part of her life had been spent in Perth. Arthur Paget was an Englishman from Southampton, in Hampshire. I have nothing against Arthur, but we had all naturally thought that Jean would have married a Scot. Still, I would not say but it has been a happy marriage, or as happy as most.'<br><br>After the war was over Arthur Paget had got a job upon a rubber estate in Malaya somewhere near Taiping, and Jean, of course, went out there with him. From that time Douglas Macfadden had seen little of his sister; she had been home on leave in 1926 and again in 1932. She had two children, Donald born in 1918 and Jean born in 1921; these children had been left in England in 1932 to live with the Paget parents and to go to school in Southampton, while their mother returned to Malaya. My client had seen them only once, in 1932 when their mother brought them up to Scotland.<br><br>The present position was that Arthur Paget had been killed in a motor accident somewhere near Ipoh; he had been driving home at night from Kuala Lumpur and had driven off the road at a high speed and hit a tree. Probably he fell asleep. His widow, Jean Paget, was in England; she had come home a year or so before his death and she had taken a small house in Bassett just outside Southampton to make a home for the children and to be near their schools. It was a sensible arrangement, of course, but it seemed to me to be a pity that the brother and the sister could not have arranged to live nearer to each other. -I fancy that my client regretted the distance that separated them, because he referred to it more than once.<br><br>He wanted to revise his will. His existing will was a very simple one, in which he left his entire estate to his sister Jean. 'I would not alter that,' he said. 'But you must understand that Arthur Paget was alive when 1 made that will, and that in the nature of things 1expected him to be alive when Jean inherited from me, and 1 expected that he would be there to guide her in matters of business. 1 shall not make old bones.'<br><br>He seemed to have a fixed idea that all women were unworldly creatures and incapable of looking after money; they were irresponsible, and at the mercy of any adventurer. Accordingly, although he wanted his sister to have the full use of his money after his death, he wanted to create a trust to ensure that her son Donald, at that time a schoolboy, should inherit the whole estate intact after his mother's death. There was, of course, no special difficulty in that. I presented to him the various pros and cons of a trust such as he envisaged, and 1 reminded him that a small legacy to Mrs Doyle, in whose house he had lived for so many years, might not be out of place provided that he was still living with them at the time of his death. He agreed to that. He told me then that he had no close relations living, and he asked me if I would undertake to be the sole trustee of his estate and the executor of his will. That is the sort of business a family solicitor frequently takes on his shoulders, of course. I told him that in view of my age he should appoint a co-trustee, and he agreed to the insertion of our junior partner, Mr Lester Robinson, to be co-trustee with me. He also agreed to a charging clause for our professional services in connection with the trust.<br><br>There only remained to tidy up the loose ends of what was, after all, a fairly simple will. I asked him what should happen if both he and his sister were to die before the boy Donald was twenty-one, and I suggested that the trust should terminate and the boy should inherit the estate absolutely when he reached his majority. He agreed to this, and I made another note upon my pad.<br><br>'Supposing then,' I said, 'that Donald should die before his mother, or if Donald and his mother should die in some way before you. The estate would then pass to the girl, Jean. Again, I take it that the trust would terminate when she reached her majority?'<br><br>'Ye mean,' he asked, 'when she became twenty-one?'<br><br>I nodded. 'Yes. That is what we decided in the case of her brother.'<br><br>He shook his head. 'I think that would be most imprudent, Mr Strachan, if I may say so. No lassie would be fit to administer her own estate when she was twenty-one. A lassie of that age is at the mercy of her sex, Mr Strachan, at the mercy of her sex. I would want the trust to continue for much longer than that. Till she was forty, at the very least.'<br><br>From various past experiences I could not help agreeing with him that twenty-one was a bit young for a girl to have absolute control over a large sum of money, but forty seemed to me to be excessively old. I stated my own view that twenty-five would be a reasonable age, and very reluctantly he receded to thirty-five. I could not move him from that position, and as he was obviously tiring and growing irritable I accepted that as the maximum duration of our trust. It meant that in those very unlikely circumstances the trust would continue for twenty-one years from that date, since the girl Jean had been born in 1921 and it was then 1935- That finished our business and I left him and went back to London to draft out the will, which I sent to him for signature. I never saw my client again. It was my fault that I lost touch with him. It had been my habit for a great many years to take my holiday in the spring, when I would go with my wife to Scotland for a fortnight's fishing, usually to Loch Shiel. I thought that this was going on for ever, as one does, and that next year I would call again upon this client on my way down from the north to see if there was any other business I could do for him. But things turn out differently, sometimes. In the winter of 1935 Lucy died. I don't want to dwell on that, but we had been married for twenty-seven years and - well, it was very painful. Both our sons were abroad, Harry in his submarine on the China station and Martin in his oil company at Basra. I hadn't the heart to go back to Loch Shiel, and I have never been to Scotland since. I had a sale and got rid of most of our furniture, and I sold our house on Wimbledon Common; one has to make an effort at a time like that, and a clean break. It's no good going on living in the ashes of a dead happiness.<br><br>I took a flat in Buckingham Gate opposite the Palace stables and just across the park from my club in Pall Mall. I furnished it with a few things out of the Wimbledon house and got a woman to come in and cook my breakfast and clean for me in the mornings, and here I set out to re-create my life. I knew the pattern well enough from the experience of others in the club. Breakfast in my flat. Walk through the Park and up the Strand to my office in Chancery Lane. Work all day, with a light lunch at my desk. To the club at six o'clock to read the periodicals, and gossip, and dine, and after dinner a rubber of bridge. That is the routine that I fell into in the spring of 1936, and I am in it still.<br><br>All this, as I say, took my mind from Douglas Macfadden; with more than half my mind upon my own affairs I could only manage to attend to those clients who had urgent business with my office. And presently another interest grew upon me. It was quite obvious that war was coming, and some of us in the club who were too old for active military service began to get very interested in Air Raid Precautions. Cutting the long story short, Civil Defence as it came to be called absorbed the whole of my leisure for the next eight years. I became a Warden, and I was on duty in my district of Westminster all through the London blitz and the long, slow years of war that followed it. Practically all my staff went on service, and I had to run the office almost single-handed. In those years I never took a holiday, and I doubt if I slept more than five hours in any night. When finally peace came in 1945 my hair was white and my head shaky, and though I improved a little in the years that followed I had definitely joined the ranks of the old men.<br><br>One afternoon in January 1948 I got a telegram from Ayr. It read,<br><br>Regret Mr Douglas Macfadden passed away last night please instruct re funeral. Doyle, Balmoral Hotel, Ayr.<br><br>I had to search my memory, I am afraid, to recollect through the war years who Mr Douglas Macfadden was, and then I had to turn to the file and the will to refresh my memory with the details of what had happened thirteen years before. It seemed rather odd to me that there was nobody at Ayr who could manage the funeral business. I put in a trunk call to Ayr right away and very soon I was speaking to Mrs Doyle. It was a bad line, but I understood that she knew of no relations; apparently Mr Macfadden had had no visitors for a very long time. Clearly, I should have to go to Ayr myself, or else send somebody. I had no urgent engagements for the next two days and the matter seemed to be a little difficult. I had a talk with Lester Robinson, my partner, who had come back from the war as a brigadier, and cleared my desk, and took the sleeper up to Glasgow after dinner that night. In the morning I went down in a slow train to Ayr.</p><h2>True Blue</h2><p>A mysterious high-profile homicide in the nation's capital collides with the dark side of national security in David Baldacci's new, heart-stopping thriller.<br><br> <b>TRUE BLUE</b><br><br> Mason "Mace" Perry was a firebrand cop on the D.C. police force until she was kidnapped and framed for a crime.

Her only shot to be a true blue again is to solve a major case on her own, and prove she has the right to wear the uniform.

Then Roy Kingman enters her life.<br><br> Roy is a young lawyer who aided the poor until he took a high-paying job at a law firm in Washington. Mace and Roy meet after he discovers the dead body of a female partner at the firm. As they investigate the death, they start uncovering surprising secrets from both the private and public world of the nation's capital. <br><br> Soon, what began as a fairly routine homicide takes a terrifying and unexpected turn-into something complex, diabolical, and possibly lethal.</p><p>David Baldacci lives with his family in Virginia.

Mace, who's just getting out of prison after serving a two-year sentence, is willing to risk everything to clear her name and reclaim her life as a cop by cracking a big case on her own. The rape-murder of a powerful lawyer as well as the killing of a prominent U.S. attorney provide Mace an opportunity to vindicate herself. While Baldacci draws his characters in bright primary colors, and some of the action reaches comic book proportions, he delivers his usual intricate plotting and sets the stage nicely for highly competent Beth and impulsive, streetwise Mace to take on more bad guys. <i>(Oct. 27)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Six months earlier, the young man had been a cook in his native Alsace, France's easternmost province. Now he was huddled with 15,000 Garde nationale volunteers in the town of Belfort, trying to defend its heavily fortified citadel against the far larger German force that had besieged them. More accustomed to wielding a frying pan than a rifle, Schueller, like his comrades in the ill-equipped and untrained band, mainly tried to survive until hoped-for reinforcements could arrive. Meanwhile, the Germans pummeled the citadel with their Krupp six-pound field guns, the long-range, rapid-firing weapons that had been decimating French troops ever since the Franco-German war broke out in July 1870.<br><br> The conflict had been triggered by a trivial diplomatic incident about which Charles Schueller, the twenty-two-year-old son of a shoemaker, understood nothing. What he did understand was that la patrie was being invaded by the Germans and his beloved Alsace was on the front lines. Like most German-speaking Alsatians, Schueller was a fervent French patriot who would rather die than live under German occupation. The Belfort volunteers-les mobiles-held out until February 18, 1871, three weeks after officials in Paris had capitulated and signed an armistice. Their commander, Col. Pierre Denfert-Rochereau, was thereafter hailed as "the Lion of Belfort" for leading the heroic resistance.<br><br> The Franco-German war had far-reaching consequences. Germany was unified under Prussian leadership. The French Second Empire collapsed when the dyspeptic Emperor Napoleon III, unwisely venturing onto the battlefield, was captured and imprisoned. Most important for Charles Schueller, the triumphant Germans annexed Alsace and Lorraine.<br><br> Schueller moved to Paris in 1871 in order to remain French. He knew no one in the capital, but soon met and wed Am lie Denisot, daughter of a toolmaker from Burgundy, who worked as a domestic servant for a baker. Shortly after their marriage, they bought a pastry shop on the rue du Cherche-Midi. It was there, on March 20, 1881, at nine a.m., that Am lie gave birth to Eug ne Schueller in a back room. Eug ne was lucky: He was the only one of their five children who survived.<br><br> It was an inauspicious beginning for a man who was destined to build one of the world's great fortunes. "Life was very rude and very hard for us," he wrote in a biographical r sum , "and it's in this atmosphere of effort and work that I was raised, under the example of my hardworking parents." Before he went to school each day, he would rise early to help prepare the pastries, an apprenticeship that pointed to a future in the family business.<br><br> But the collapse of the Panama Canal Company in 1891 wiped out the couple's savings and forced them to move to the cheaper suburb of Levallois-Perret, where they bought another pastry shop. That turned out to be a big break for Eug ne: His parents supplied bread to the nearby Coll ge Sainte-Croix de Neuilly, an elite private school, which agreed to admit the boy as a student.<br><br> Eug ne earned top grades in all his classes before moving on to the Lyc e Condorcet in Paris, another elite school. There again, he excelled in his studies. After taking his Baccalaur at degree-roughly equivalent to two years of college-he entered the Institute of Applied Chemistry, where, as he said with typical immodesty, "I succeeded brilliantly and finished first in my class." Following his graduation in 1904, he took a position as a laboratory assistant to Professor Victor Auger at the Sorbonne. That seemed to map out a respectable but hardly lucrative career as a university researcher.<br><br> But then something happened that would change his life. The owner of a large barbershop visited Auger seeking help in developing a synthetic hair dye. At the time hair dyes were not widely used by Frenchwomen, largely because most of the lead-based concoctions that existed were toxic and irritated the scalp. The products were held in such ill repute that the Baroness de Staffe, a sort of nineteenth-century French Miss Manners, wrote in 1893 that their use "damages the brain and the eyesight." Schueller agreed to become the barber's technical adviser, working three hours each evening for 50 francs a month-a modest sum equal to about $260 today.<br><br> Even then the ambitious young man chafed at the idea of working under someone else�s orders. He soon cut ties with the barber and struck out on his own. Starting with a capital of 800 francs-roughly $4,000 in today�s money-he began experimenting with hair dyes in a rented space near the Tuileries Gardens, a vast park laid out in the mid-seventeenth century by the landscape architect Andr Le N&#x2122;tre, who also created the matchless perspectives surrounding the Ch&#x2030;teau de Versailles. A photo from this period shows Schueller sitting next to some kind of mechanical contraption, looking studious with an open book in his hand, dressed stiffly in a black suit and bow tie, his dark wavy hair swept back from his high forehead, and sporting a black mustache. What doesn�t show in the black-and-white photo is the intensity of Schueller�s blue eyes, one of his most striking and defining features.<br><br> His first efforts were disappointing, and his attempts to sell his products to hairdressers got nowhere. "It was a very difficult time," he wrote. "I lived alone, cooked my own meals, and slept in a little camp bed in my laboratory, and when I think back on these days, I wonder how I got through it." But he persisted, continuing his experiments, changing formulas, even trying the dyes out on his own hair. "Finally, I had the good fortune, which I think I deserved, to obtain a product of excellent quality that allowed me at last to launch my company."<br><br> In 1909, he founded the Soci t fran aise de teintures inoffensives pour cheveux-the French Company of Inoffensive Hair Dyes-a mouthful that he soon changed to L'Or al. The new corporate name was a homonym for the brand of Schueller's first product, "Aur ale," based on a popular hairstyle of the period and playing on the word aur ole, or halo. He could not know it then, but his little business would in time become the world's largest cosmetics firm and generate the enormous fortune that his yet-unborn daughter would one day inherit.<br><br> Things moved quickly after that. The same year as he founded L'Or al, Schueller married a young piano teacher named Louise Madeleine Berthe Doncieux, better known as "Betsy." The couple moved to a larger apartment on the rue du Louvre, near the celebrated museum, where Schueller also set up his laboratory, his office, and his first store. An influx of capital from a new partner and the hiring of a full-time salesman-a former hairdresser for the Imperial Russian court-allowed Schueller to expand his activities. He created a hair-dyeing school, recruited representatives to market the product outside of Paris, launched a promotional magazine, and commissioned a well-known artist, Raoul Vion, to create his first poster: It depicted a blond woman whose hair took the sweeping form of a comet, the first graphic image of a brand whose reputation spread quickly around the country.<br><br> Schueller was an obsessive worker and a restless thinker. As if running his company was not enough to occupy his mind, he was forever probing new ideas about the organization of industry, the economy, and politics. In his early days, he dabbled with Socialist ideas under the influence of his friend Jacques Sadoul, an ex-schoolmate from the Coll ge Saint-Croix and a future member of the French Communist Party. Around 1910, he became a Freemason, briefly immersing himself in the secret cult of intellectual humanism before leaving it three years later. (He would later become a visceral opponent of Freemasonry-along with Jews and republicanism.)<br><br> Schueller's philosophical ruminations, like his business activities, were rudely interrupted on August 1, 1914, by the onset of the First World War. Like his Alsatian father before him, Schueller was determined to fight for his country but, at the mature age of thirty-three, he was assigned auxiliary status. He volunteered for active duty in the army, but was only offered a post as a chemist in an armaments factory. He continued to demand a combat role and finally succeeded in joining the 31st Artillery Regiment of Le Mans. Sent to the front as a liaison officer, he distinguished himself at Verdun, l'Aisne, and other major battles. Schueller's wartime service won him five citations for valor, the L gion d'honneur, and the Croix de guerre, France's highest military decoration. One citation described him as a "peerless liaison officer" remarkable for his "vigor," his "boldness," and his "contempt for danger."<br><br> During Schueller's four-year absence from the helm of L'Or al, his wife, Betsy, had run the company so capably that he found his business "flourishing" upon his return from the army in 1919. Her performance could have led Schueller to give her a more active role in the business. But he was a product of his times who considered a woman's place to be in the home, not on the shop floor or the corner office. (In France at that time, women were legally treated as minors who had no vote and only limited property rights.) So Betsy returned to her piano, her homemaking, and, before long, her childrearing: On October 21, 1922, she gave birth to the couple's only child, Liliane Henriette Charlotte Schueller, future heiress to one of France's greatest fortunes.<br><br> Meanwhile, the 1920s were roaring. In France, as in America, it was the Jazz Age, and women�s styles were changing from the staid prewar fashions: Hemlines were higher, dresses more clinging, and, thanks largely to the influence of Coco Chanel, women started wearing their hair shorter. That was good news for Eug ne Schueller: Shorter hair was easier to dye, and the emancipated spirit of the times freed women to change their color, something that in an earlier era was frowned on by respectable ladies. As the stock markets rose feverishly around the world, L�Or al�s business boomed. Its products were now exported to Italy, England, Holland, even crossing the Atlantic to the United States and Brazil. By 1921, the company had permanent offices in London and New York, in addition to the Paris headquarters at 14 rue Royale, near the Madeleine church.<br><br> Emboldened by the success of his core business, Schueller began seeking opportunities in areas apart from L'Or al. Shortly after his return from the war, a manufacturer of hair combs sought his advice on a way to increase production of celluloid. Thanks to what Schueller called his "opportune invention" to speed the manufacturing process, the celluloid company increased production tenfold and Schueller became a partner. After engineering a merger with a plastics firm in 1925, he became the director of the new Soci t industrielle des mati res plastiques. Two years later, following a falling-out with his partners, he negotiated his departure in exchange for their shares in an American company, the Valstar Corporation, a manufacturer of paint and varnish. Schueller thus found himself the director and largest shareholder of Valentine, Valstar's French subsidiary. Around the same time, working with the Lumi re brothers, the legendary cinema pioneers, Schueller created a Lyon-based firm called Plavic Film, which manufactured film for movie and still cameras.<br><br> Not all of Schueller's adventures succeeded as well as L'Or al. Invited by the new Soviet government to set up a plastics factory near Moscow, Schueller made several trips to Russia between 1926 and 1928, but the experience was a disaster: The promised factory site was far from the capital, the workers' unions interfered with production, and in 1932 the government took over the company. The experience left Schueller, despite his earlier Socialist leanings, with a profound distrust of unions and anything smacking of Bolshevism.<br><br> In 1928 he agreed to take over a failing soap manufacturer called Monsavon. But the French soap market was saturated with competitors at the time and Schueller found it almost impossible to sell his product. At one point, he was spending 300,000 francs (worth about $1.5 million today) a month out of his own pocket and even had to mortgage his properties to keep the company afloat. Working with the fledgling Publicis advertising agency, created in 1926 by Marcel Bleustein-Blanchet, Schueller launched a massive publicity campaign, based on radio spots, posters, and newspaper and magazine ads.<br><br> In a pitch aimed especially at the rural population, Schueller added milk to the soap formula and circulated posters showing mother cows washing their calves with Monsavon and mooing: "There is nothing better than milk." Another sales tactic was to persuade the French that they were dirty and did not wash enough. Schueller instructed his sales force to "tell people that they're disgusting, they don't smell good and they're not beautiful." The image of the unwashed French multitudes apparently had some basis in fact. In his 1869 travel book, Innocents Abroad, Mark Twain complained that the people of Marseille, a soap-making center, "never . . . wash with their soap themselves." A report by the Rockefeller Foundation, which sent a mission to France to fight a tuberculosis epidemic after World War I, lamented "the indifference of public opinion on questions of hygiene."<br><br> The results of Schueller's campaign were impressive: By 1939 Monsavon was on the verge of becoming the biggest soap company in France. Schueller was way ahead of his time in his use of advertising, particularly radio ads, to sell his products. He hired composers and singers to create catchy jingles, created simulated conversations vaunting the merits of his products, and staged spectacular events like hanging a 10,000-square-meter canvas on the fa ade of a Parisian building, hawking L'Or al's O'Cap hair lotion. Jingles for the company's Dop shampoo and Ambre Solaire suntan lotion became classics in the promotional genre. In 1933, Schueller created a slick monthly magazine called Votre Beaut , which he ran in his typical hands-on fashion, approving the layouts, editing the articles, and even writing some of them himself.<br><br> Even as his affairs prospered, Eug ne Schueller could hardly be reassured by the turbulence that swept over Europe in the 1930s against the backdrop of the Great Depression. In Germany, Hitler�s Nazi Party came to power in 1933, reorganized the economy along authoritarian lines, and launched a massive remilitarization. In Italy, Mussolini, in power since 1922, consolidated his Fascist dictatorship and invaded Ethiopia. In the Soviet Union, a totalitarian Communist regime pursued its ruthless program of nationalization, collectivism, and central economic planning. In Spain, Franco crushed the Republicans in a three-year civil war and imposed his four-and-a-half-decade dictatorship. And in France, the Third Republic, the parliamentary regime that had followed the fall of Napoleon III in 1871, teetered on the verge of collapse.<br><br> President Paul Doumer was assassinated by a pro-Fascist Russian in 1932. Two years later, on February 6, 1934, violent clashes between police and far-right rioters on the Place de la Concorde left some 30 dead and 2,000 wounded. In a country rocked by strikes, militant syndicalism, unemployment, and political instability-the revolving-door governments of the Third Republic lasted an average of six months-the leftist Front populaire under Socialist L on Blum won a parliamentary majority in 1936 and proceeded to carry out a number of sweeping reforms. Among them: the five-day workweek, graduated wage hikes, nationalization of the...</p><h2>Under the Dome: A Novel</h2><p>A CBS television series! Stephen King&#x2019;s thrilling #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling tour-de-force that <i>The Washington Post</i> called &#x201c;powerful&#x201d; and &#x201c;harrowing&#x201d; follows the apocalyptic course of events when one Maine town is physically cut off from the rest of the world.<br><br>On an entirely normal, beautiful fall day in Chester&#x2019;s Mill, Maine, the town is inexplicably and suddenly sealed off from the rest of the world by an invisible force field. Planes crash into it and fall from the sky in flaming wreckage, a gardener&#x2019;s hand is severed as &#x201c;the dome&#x201d; comes down on it, people running errands in the neighboring town are divided from their families, and cars explode on impact.

It&#x2019;s running out.</p><p><strong>Amazon Exclusive: Guillermo del Toro and Chuck Hogan Reviews <em>Under the Dome</em></strong><br><br> <b>Guillermo del Toro and Chuck Hogan share their enthusiasm for Stephen King's thriller, <i>Under the Dome</i>. This pair of reviewers knows a thing or two about the art of crafting a great thriller. Del Toro is the Oscar-nominated director of international blockbuster films, including <em>Pan's Labyrinth</em> and <em>Hellboy</em>. Hogan is the author of several acclaimed novels, including <em>The Standoff</em> and <em>Prince of Thieves</em>, which won the International Association of Crime Writer's Dashiell Hammett Award in 2005. The two recently collaborated to write the bestselling horror novel, <em>The Strain</em>, the first of a proposed trilogy. Read their exclusive Amazon guest review of <i>Under the Dome</i>:</b><br><br> The first thing readers might find scary about Stephen King's <i>Under The Dome</i> is its length. The second is the elaborate town map and list of characters at the front of the book (including "Dogs of Note"), which sometimes portends, you know, heavy lifting. Don't you believe it. Breathless pacing and effortless characterization are the hallmarks of King's best books, and here the writing is immersive, the suspense unrelenting. The pages turn so fast that your hand--or Kindle-clicking thumb--will barely be able to keep up. <p></p> <p> <i>You Are Here.</i> </p> <p> Nobody yarns a &#x201c;What if?&#x201d; like Stephen King. Nobody. The implausibility of a dome sealing off an entire city--a motif seen before in pulp magazines and on comic book covers--is given the most elaborate real-life alibi by crafting details, observations, and insights that make us nod silently while we read. Promotional materials reference <em>The Stand</em> in comparison, but we liken <i>Under The Dome</i> more to King's excellent novella, <em>The Mist</em>: another locked-door situation on an epic scale, a tour-de-force in which external stressors bake off the civility of a small town full of dark secrets, exposing souls both very good...and very, very bad.</p> <p> Yes, "The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street," but there is so much more this time. The expansion of King&#x2019;s diorama does not simply take a one-street fable and turn it into a town, but finds new life for old archetypes, making them morally complex and attuned to our world today. It makes them relevant and affecting once again. And the beauty of it all is that the final lesson, the great insight that is gained at the end of this draining journey, is not a righteous 1950&#x2019;s sermon but an incredibly moving and simple truth. A nugget of wisdom you'll be using as soon as you turn the last page. </p> <p> <i>This Is Now.</i> </p> <p> Along the way, you get bravura writing, especially featuring the town kids, and a delicious death aria involving one of the most nefarious characters--who dies alone, but not really--as well as a few laugh-out-loud moments, and a cameo (of sorts) by none other than Jack Reacher. Indeed--whether during a much-needed comfort break, or a therapeutic hand-flexing--you may find yourself wondering, "Is this a horror novel? Or is it a thriller?" The answer, of course, is: Yes, yes, yes. </p> <p> <i>"...the blood hits the wall like it always hits the wall."</i> </p> <p> It seems impossible that, as he enters his sixth decade of publishing, the dean of dark fiction could add to his vast readership. But that is precisely what will happen...when the Dome drops.</p><p> <i>Now Go Read It. --Guillermo Del Toro and Chuck Hogan</i></p><p> </p><p></p><p></p> <p><strong>The Story Behind the Cover</strong><br>Click on image to enlarge </p><p> </p><p> The jacket concept for <i>Under the Dome</i> originated as an ambitious idea from the mind of Stephen King. The artwork is a combination of photographs, illustration and 3-D rendering. This is a departure from the direction of King's most recent illustrated covers. <br><br> In order to achieve the arresting image for this jacket, Scribner art director Rex Bonomelli had to seek out artists who could do a convincing job of creating a realistic portrayal of the town of Chester's Mill, the setting of the novel. Bonomelli found the perfect team of digital artists, based in South America and New York, whose cutting edge work had previously been devoted to advertisement campaigns. This was their first book jacket and an exciting venture for them. "They are used to working with the demands of corporate clients," says Bonomelli. "We gave them freedom and are thrilled with what they came up with." <br><br> The CGI (computer generated imagery) enhanced image looks more like something made for the big screen than for the page and is sure to make a lasting impact on King fans. <br></p><p></p> <p><strong>Meet the Characters</strong> </p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> <b>Dale Barbara</b><br>Barbie, a drifter, ex-army, walks with a burden of guilt from the time he spent in Iraq.

His work has been called &#34;ingenious&#34; (The London Times), &#34;goofily inventive&#34; (The New York Times), and &#34;entertaining and slyly educational&#34; (The Comics Journal). His works include Active Synapse classics such as Clan Apis, The Sandwalk Adventures, and Optical Allusions.Gr. 5-7. The life cycle and natural environment of the honeybee become grist for an entomologist who is both cartoonist and storyteller. Opening with a creation myth ("Once upon a long, long time ago") and working through the biological, sociological, and ecological changes affecting the life of Nyuki the bee, the text is a combination of authoritative science; appealing, detailed black-and-white drawings; and dialogue replete with humor, pubescent angst, political sloganeering, and more. Nyuki's colony undertakes migration to a new hive, is beset by a woodpecker, and hibernates through a winter that yields to a revitalizing spring. The bees are nicely individualized, as are the plants and other insects that figure into their lives, and there are a number of clever touches. All in all, this is the sort of science book that even devoted fiction and comics readers will enjoy. <i>Francisca Goldsmith</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Sleuthing between Cornwall and London, Jury tries to link the disappearance and deaths of very young girls. Paul Hecht is a gifted narrator, offering a confidant, articulate performance of Cornwall gardeners, London businessmen, and country squires. But something's missing--perhaps it's the mostly subtle British accents and light characterizations. Grimes plays her characters to the hilt, yet Hecht seems to hold back, so the vocal portraits seem a little lackluster. The abridgment is good for the most part, but the ending seems to dissipate after a strong and intriguing build-up.

Birk, hailed by the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> as one of "realism's edgier, more visionary painters," offers extraordinarily nuanced and vivid illustrations inspired by Gustave Dore's famous engravings. This modern interpretation depicts an infernal landscape infested with mini-malls, fast food restaurants, ATMs, and other urban fixtures, and a text that cleverly incorporates urban slang and references to modern events and people (as Dante did in his own time). Previously published in a deluxe, fine-press edition to wide praise, and accompanied by national exhibitions, this striking paperback edition of <i>Dante's Inferno</i> is a genuinely provocative and insightful adaptation for a new generation of readers.</p><p>Sandow Birk is a recipient of both Guggenheim and Fulbright fellowships. His work has been exhibited widely and published in several books. He lives in Long Beach, California.<br><br>Marcus Sanders is a contributing editor for Surfing and Surfline, and has written for numerous travel and surfing magazines. Born and raised in Canada, he lives in San Francisco.Creative people who don't write sometimes enjoy a honeymoon with the press -- right up until they put pen to paper. It happened with Madonna. She used to give interviews saying what an old-fashioned girl she really was at heart, how all she'd really like to do was find a nice writer and settle down. Consequently, she barely ever saw a bad review -- until she made the mistake of writing her first book. Critics promptly saw they'd been kidding themselves all along, and they turned on her.<p> So when word got around that the visionary California painter and book artist Sandow Birk was not just illustrating but co-writing a new adaptation of Dante's "Divine Comedy," some of us who cherish his work feared the worst. Sure, he could concoct historical canvases, sketches and propaganda posters about a bloody civil war between San Francisco and Los Angeles, as he did with "In Smog and Thunder: Historical Works From the Great War of the Californias." And OK, he could paint majestic landscapes of each of California's 33 state prisons in the luminist style of Albert Bierstadt and Frederic Remington, as he did with "Incarcerated: Visions of California in the 21st Century." Pastiching great painters was one thing. But Dante? In tackling not just fine but literary art for the first time, was Birk cruising for the same bruising Madonna got? </p><p> In a word, no. This version of the "Inferno" is God's face in a Groucho mask, a triumphant cathedral that will bring new readers to Dante, new appreciation for Birk's model here -- the great French illustrator Gustave Dore -- and new converts to the growing church of Sandow Birk. </p><p> The cover is so infernally beautiful that folks reading in public would do well to keep a tight grip on it. Imagine a panoramic hellscape in ochers and siennas, all set against a sulfurous sunset sky. On the left, half of the Golden Gate Bridge yearns forlornly, cables dangling from its broken span. To the right rises the ziggurat-crowned thrust of Los Angeles City Hall. Down below, so discreet that I never noticed it even in an art gallery last year, where the canvas measured a good 9 feet across, stands the leafless lattice of the World Trade Center's unmistakable stumps. And in the lower right corner, snaking around skyscrapers, oil refineries, palm trees and crow-clad telephone wires, writhes the telltale red and white tracery of nighttime freeways in gridlock. Behold -- literally -- the commute from hell.</p><p> For Birk, as for Dante, hell isn't just some posthumous grade you get on your life. It's a porous netherworld that welcomes slumming tourists like Dante and periodically overflows the infernal regions to contaminate the living world. Just look at Birk's panel for Canto III, the moment when the poet Virgil guides Dante through the gates of hell. Birk's Virgil resembles the caped figure familiar from Dore's edition, but here he's leading Dante past an overturned car into a littered, ominous underground garage. Signs beside them read "Do not back up/Severe tire damage" and "More parking lower level," and visible on the horizon is the Hollywood sign. Either hell is in Los Angeles, or Los Angeles is in hell.</p><p> Birk has drawn a full-page lithograph like this, plus a small black-and- white frontispiece, for each of Dante's 34 chapters. With the help of journalist and fellow surfer Marcus Sanders, he's also "adapted" Dante's text. They've avoided the word "translate," and it's not hard to see why.

In 1779, while Creeks and Cherokees were dying in Georgia, smallpox broke out in Mexico City, whence it followed travelers going north, striking Santa Fe and outlying pueblos in January 1781.

But it was probably on this day that nineteen-year-old George Washington set sail from Virginia to the island of Barbados with his older half brother, Lawrence. If their departure date is unclear, the brothers' purpose is not: The trip was intended to ease Lawrence's persistent cough and congested lungs, symptoms of the consumption that was to kill him within a year. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, travel abroad was a favored treatment for consumption, the contagious disease that today we call tuberculosis. Early Americans understood consumption to be an ailment of heredity and climate, alleviated by salt air, mountain breezes, or whatever atmospheric conditions best suited a particular patient's constitution. It was the Washingtons' hope that Barbados would suit Lawrence.</i><i>The trip was difficult. Hurricanes regularly strafe the Caribbean in the early fall, and 1751 was no exception. The brothers and their shipmates endured a week of stiff gales, rain squalls, and high seas in late October, the effects of a nearby storm. They disembarked at Bridgetown, Barbados, on November 2, 1751. Although the purpose of the journey was to ease Lawrence's consumption, it was soon George who lay seriously ill--not from tuberculosis, but from smallpox.</i><i>On November 3, the day after landing, the two brothers begrudgingly accepted an invitation to dine at the home of Gedney Clarke, a prominentmerchant, planter, and slave trader with family ties to the Washingtons. "We went,--myself with some reluctance, as the smallpox was in his family," George wrote in his diary. His misgivings were justified. For a fortnight afterward, the two Americans plied the Barbadian social circuit, unaware of the virus silently multiplying in George's body. Then, on November 17, when the incubation period had passed, the infection hit hard. "Was strongly attacked with the small Pox," Washington wrote. Thereafter, his journal entries stop. Not until December 12, when he was well enough to go out once again, did George Washington return to his diary.</i><i>The brothers' stay in Barbados was brief. "This climate has not afforded the relief I expected from it," wrote Lawrence. On December 22, the brothers parted ways, George returning to Virginia and Lawrence opting for the more promising climate of Bermuda. Lawrence's health was failing fast. He spent the spring in Bermuda and then hurried desperately to his home at Mount Vernon, Virginia, where tuberculosis took his life on July 26, 1752.</i><i>1</i>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>On Sunday, July 2, 1775, a much-older George Washington stepped out of a carriage in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to take command of the Continental army, newly established by the Congress still meeting in Philadelphia. Already, an American siege of nearby Boston was under way. The standoff was the outcome of the battles of Lexington and Concord in April 1775, when an angry throng of New England militiamen had routed a column of British troops attempting to seize a stash of munitions at Concord. Exhausted and humiliated, the king's soldiers had staggered sixteen miles back to Boston under relentless American sniper fire. Here they were trapped. The armed patriots were to besiege them in the city for the next eleven months.By the time Washington arrived to command the American army in July, the confrontation had taken on an added dimension: It was not just military but medical as well. Smallpox was spreading through Boston. Washington knew how debilitating the disease could be, and he knew that the New Englanders who formedthe core of his Boston-based army were among those most likely to be vulnerable. It was a vulnerability they shared with a great many others in late-eighteenth-century North America.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>When smallpox struck George Washington in Barbados in 1751, his diary entries stopped for twenty-four days. If this was not inevitable, it was nevertheless predictable. Rare was the diarist who kept writing through the throes of the smallpox. The void in Washington's diary is thus telling; its very silence speaks of a misery commonplace in years gone by but unfamiliar to the world today.Although the route of infection is impossible to determine, it is most likely that Washington picked up <i>Variola</i> through direct contact with a sick member of the Gedney Clarke household. The contagious party may have been Mrs. Clarke herself, who was "much indisposed" at the time of the brothers' visit. If Washington had a face-to-face meeting with her, he might have inhaled tiny infectious droplets or his hands might have carried the contagion to his mouth or nose. Such an encounter is the most likely mode of infection, but it is by no means the only one possible. Even scabs and dried-out body secretions can transmit smallpox. If someone had recently swept the floors or changed the bedclothes in a sickroom in the Clarke home, desiccated but dangerous particles may have circulated aloft. Finally, one last form of transmission bears mentioning. <i>Variola</i> can survive for weeks outside the human body. Carefully stored, it retains its virulence for years.2 Thus it is conceivable that George Washington caught smallpox from an inanimate object (often cloth or clothing) contaminated with the virus.How do we know that Washington caught smallpox in the Clarke household? The acknowledged presence of the disease there is one clue. Timing is another. The incubation period for smallpox usually ranges from ten to fourteen days. A twelve-day incubation is most common, with the first symptoms appearingthirteen days after exposure.3 George Washington's case was thus fairly typical. He dined at the Clarke home on November 3, and according to his diary, his first symptoms appeared fourteen days later.We have no firsthand description of Washington's bout with the pox. But to judge by the experience of other victims, his early symptoms would have resembled a very nasty case of the flu. Headache, backache, fever, vomiting, and general malaise all are among the initial signs of infection. The headache can be splitting; the backache, excruciating. Lakota (Sioux) Indian representations of smallpox often use a spiral symbol to illustrate intense pain in the midsection. Anxiety is another symptom. Fretful, overwrought patients often die within days, never even developing the distinctive rash identified with the disease. Twentieth-century studies indicate that such hard-to-diagnose cases are rare. But eyewitness accounts suggest that in historical epidemics, this deadly form of smallpox may have been more common among Native Americans, who frequently died before the telltale skin eruptions appeared.4To judge by the outcome of his illness, George Washington's "pre-eruptive" symptoms were not nearly so grave. The fever usually abates after the first day or two, and many patients rally briefly. Some may be fooled into thinking they have indeed had a mere bout of the flu. But the respite is deceptive, for relief is fleeting. By the fourth day of symptoms, the fever creeps upward again, and the first smallpox sores appear in the mouth, throat, and nasal passages. At this point, the patient is contagious. Susceptible individuals risk their lives if they come near.The rash now moves quickly. Over a twenty-four-hour period, it extends itself from the mucous membranes to the surface of the skin. On some, it turns inward, hemorrhaging subcutaneously. These victims die early, bleeding from the gums, eyes, nose, and other orifices. In most cases, however, the rash turns outward, covering the victim in raised pustules that concentrate in precisely the places where they will cause the most physical pain and psychological anguish: The soles of the feet, the palms of the hands, the face, forearms, neck, and back are focal points of the eruption. Elsewhere, the distribution is lighter.If the pustules remain discrete--if they do not run together--the prognosis is good. But if they converge upon one another in a single oozing mass, it is not. This is called confluent smallpox, and patients who develop it stand at least a 60 percent chance of dying. For some, as the rash progresses in the mouth and throat, drinking becomes difficult, and dehydration follows. Often, an odor peculiar to smallpox develops. "The small-pox pustules begin to crack run and smell," wrote a Boston physician in 1722. A missionary in Brazil described a "pox so loathsome and evil-smelling that none could stand the great stench" of its victims.5 Patients at this stage of the disease can be hard to recognize. If damage to the eyes occurs, it begins now. Secondary bacterial infections can also set in, with consequences fully as severe as those of the smallpox.Scabs start to form after two weeks of suffering, but this does little to end the patient's ordeal. In confluent or semiconfluent cases of the disease, scabbing can encrust most of the body, making any movement excruciating. The Puritan leader William Bradford described this condition among the Narragansett Indians in 1634: "They lye on their hard matts, the poxe breaking and mattering, and runing one into another, their skin cleaving (by reason therof) to the matts they lye on; when they turne them, a whole side will flea of[f] at once." An earlier report from Brazil told of "pox that were so rotten and poisonous that the flesh fell off" the victims "in pieces full of evil-smelling beasties."6Death, when it occurs, usually comes after ten to sixteen days of suffering. Thereafter, the risk drops significantly as fever subsides and unsightly scars replace scabs and pustules. After four weeks of illness, only the lesions encapsulated in the palms of the hands and soles of the feet remain intact. Unlucky sufferers whose feet have hardened from years of walking barefoot sometimes shed the entire sole of the foot at this time, delaying recovery considerably. But in most cases, the usual course of the disease--from initial infection to the loss of all scabs--runs a little over a month. Patients remain contagious until the last scab falls off.Although the timing and progress of George Washington's bout with smallpox appear typical, his infection may have been milder than most. According to one of his biographers, he escaped the disease with "only several very light scars on his nose."7 Most survivors bear more numerous scars, and some are blinded. But despite the consequences, those who live through the illness can count themselves fortunate. Immune for life, they need never fear smallpox again.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The case fatality rate of a disease is an indication of the number of deaths that occur among those who contract it. For the historical study of smallpox, these figures can be elusive, deceptive, and downright confusing. The reasons are various. For one thing, most twentieth-century surveys included both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. Because vaccinated persons tend to have mild forms of the disease if they catch it at all, studies that include them provide no usable comparison to mortality in the days before Edward Jenner's earth-shattering development of 1796. To confuse matters further, a new, much less virulent smallpox virus named <i>Variola minor</i> appeared in the 1890s, quickly supplanting <i>Variola major</i> in many parts of the world. This milder bug was not present in George Washington's day, and its emergence makes many twentieth-century studies unsuitable for assessing death rates in earlier times.Given these problems with relatively modern data, one might expect appraisals of epidemics in centuries past to be more helpful in assessing the historical impact of the disease. Unfortunately, this is not the case. In outbreaks of smallpox before the emergence of <i>Variola minor</i> and before the development of vaccination, case fatality rates appear to have fluctuated wildly. The differences could be due to the particular vulnerabilities of a given population,the changing virulence of the virus, the availability of nursing care, or even the widespread presence of immune systems compromised by such factors as famine.Despite these disclaimers and caveats, one historical trend is clearly identifiable in the documentary record. In general, <i>Variola</i> appears to have become <i>more</i> virulent in the three centuries leading up to 1800. In Florence, Italy, between 1424 and 1458, officials recorded only eighty-four smallpox deaths despite three epidemics of the disease in the same years. In mid-seventeenth-century London, the case fatality rate from <i>Variola</i> hovered around 7 percent. A famous outbreak in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1721 yielded a much higher rate of 15 percent. By 1792, in another outbreak in the same city, the rate reached 30 percent. A Scottish smallpox epidemic in 1787 also took the lives of a third of its victims. Just a few years later, a "virgin soil" epidemic--an outbreak in a population with no prior exposure to the disease--struck an isolated village on the Japanese island of Hachijo-Jima. Of the 86 percent of villagers infected, some 38 percent died. Finally, in what may be the only modern study with relevance for epidemics in the pre-Jenner era, an analysis of seven thousand unvaccinated smallpox cases in Madras, India, during the 1960s revealed a frightening case fatality rate of 43 percent.8Another story lies beneath these broad, population-based figures. When attacked by <i>Variola,</i> certain individuals consistently fare worse than others. Here two recent studies <i>are</i> valuable. They show that the very old and the very young die in disproportionate numbers when smallpox erupts. The highest case fatality rates appear among those under the age of one and over the age of forty-five or fifty. The lowest rates occur in the five- to fourteen-year-old age group. The difference is dramatic: In one study, <i>Variola</i> took the lives of 29 percent of its victims under one year old and 32 percent of its victims over forty-five, but among five- to fourteen-year-olds, the case fatality rate was only 8 percent.9 Although both these studies included vaccinated individuals, there is no reason to think that similar age-related patterns (with highercase fatality rates) would not be detected in a wholly unvaccinated population.Pregnant women, like infants and the elderly, fare badly under <i>Variola's</i> assault. Here again, modern studies include both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. They nevertheless show that the impact of smallpox on pregnancy is dire. Of early-term pregnancies, almost 75 percent end in spontaneous abortions or stillbirths. Of late-term pregnancies, nearly 60 percent terminate in the same way. While some babies are born alive, 55 percent of them die within two weeks, usually within three days of birth. The maternal prognosis is similarly grim. In the prevaccination era, it is likely that half of all pregnant women infected with <i>Variola</i> developed what is called hemorrhagic smallpox, the most deadly form of the disease known, with a case fatality rate exceeding 96 percent. 10Finally, smallpox sufferers in the throes of famine not surprisingly do worse. Blindness in particular seems more common among malnourished victims, but other complications may occur more frequently as well. Ironically, because scarcity causes people to circulate broadly in their search for food, it may help spread contagious pathogens such as <i>Variola.</i> A recent study of America's northern plains Indians indicate...</p><h2>10 Steps Completely Overcome Vaginismus Book 2 : Personal Journal and Workbook</h2><p>Clean and unmarked, appears never read.

She was peering into the shopping cart.<br><br>&#x201c;That woman you just said hello to.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, she has a girl in Matthew&#x2019;s class,&#x201d; Audra said, selecting an apple. &#x201c;And a five-�year-�old and a toddler and that baby, if you can believe it. But no more, because when the baby was only a week old, she had her husband get a vasectomy. Just made the arrangements and woke him that morning and said, &#x2018;Guess what? You&#x2019;ve got a doctor&#x2019;s appointment.&#x2019; And he went!&#x201d;<br><br>She took a bite of the apple. Audra was forty-�one&#x2014;�a slender woman with a not-�quite-�perfectly oval face. In fact, Graham sometimes thought, all of Audra was not-�quite. Her eyes were not quite brown but had stalled at hazel, her lips were not quite full enough to be lush, her eyebrows were not quite high enough to be called arched, her chin-�length hair was not quite auburn, and its messy waves were not quite ringlets. She&#x2019;d worn her hair this length for as long as Graham had known her. Apparently, if she cut it shorter, it curled up around her face and made her head look overly round, and if she grew it longer, the ends got too heavy and she had to have lots of layers put in. (This was marriage: you started out thinking you&#x2019;d married the most interesting person in all the world and twelve years later, your head was full of useless hair facts. Of course, there was other stuff in there&#x2014;�some milestones, having a baby, buying a house&#x2014;�but that was basically the essence of it.)

How are you?&#x201d; You would have thought she was greeting a whole soccer team instead of one lady in a T-shirt and jeans with her hair pulled back into a bun.<br><br>&#x201c;Hello, Audra,&#x201d; the lady said.<br><br>&#x201c;So sorry I missed yoga this morning, Beverly!&#x201d; Audra said. She cleared her throat. &#x201c;Or, um, I mean, Maninder Prem. Sorry, again, I forgot that you go by your spiritual name now, right? Even in the supermarket?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You can call me Beverly,&#x201d; the lady said neutrally. &#x201c;But please remember that I have a no-�refund policy for late cancellations and no-�shows.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; Audra said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just that this morning we had a slight&#x2014;�well, I don&#x2019;t know if you would call it a family emergency, more of a family situation&#x2014;�regarding my mother-�in-�law and an ancient jar of capers in her fridge and a trip to the hospital&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>Audra&#x2019;s tendency to lie could still shock Graham.

There seemed to be more to say but she wasn&#x2019;t saying it.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes&#x2014;�&#x201d; Audra said. There seemed to be more for her to say, too, but she wasn&#x2019;t saying it, either. Finally, she made a fluttery little gesture and said, &#x201c;Beverly, this is my husband, Graham. Graham, this is my yoga teacher, Beverly.&#x201d;<br><br>Graham smiled politely and shook hands with Beverly, who looked him up and down, her eyelids flickering. He was fifteen years older than Audra and he could tell that Beverly was thinking, Oh, it&#x2019;s one of those marriages. Graham wanted to tell her that it wasn&#x2019;t one of those marriages, that his relationship with Audra was so special and unique even he didn&#x2019;t know what it was, but he&#x2019;d given up on trying to communicate that long ago. He was tall and in good shape, with the hair at his temples just starting to go gray, but he suddenly felt tempted to stand up straighter. (Was it just Graham or was Beverly awfully judgmental, especially for a yoga teacher?)<br><br>&#x201c;So anyway,&#x201d; Audra said, &#x201c;see you next week, Beverly.&#x201d;<br><br>They moved on, and as soon as they went around the corner and out of sight, Audra said, &#x201c;I completely forgot about yoga this morning!&#x201d; as though that hadn&#x2019;t been as obvious as a bumper sticker.<br><br>&#x201c;I think Beverly could tell that,&#x201d; Graham said.<br><br>Audra sighed. &#x201c;Maybe so. I don&#x2019;t know why I ever thought yoga class early on a Saturday morning was such a good idea. I guess I must have been feeling particularly empowered when I signed up.&#x201d;<br><br>They saw their appliance repairman, Brady Shannon, in the ice cream aisle, and Graham knew that Audra would have an extralong talk with Brady because she believed that if you were very, very nice to repairmen, they responded very, very quickly the next time you needed something repaired. The fact that this theory had proved very, very untrue had not shaken her belief in the practice.<br><br>&#x201c;Brady Shannon!&#x201d; Audra exclaimed.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, hello, Ms. Daltry, Mr. Cavanaugh,&#x201d; Brady said. He was a slight, balding man wearing a gray sweat suit and those black padded kneepads that skateboarders wear. Every time Graham had seen him, Brady was wearing those kneepads, presumably because he was always having to get down and crawl around people&#x2019;s refrigerators and washing machines.<br><br>&#x201c;I was thinking of you just this morning,&#x201d; Audra said. &#x201c;In fact, I think of you every morning when I get in the shower!&#x201d; Brady had recently fixed their shower head. &#x201c;I think, This feels heavenly and I owe it all to Brady Shannon!&#x201d;<br><br>Brady smirked at Audra and rocked a little on the balls of his feet.<br><br>Not for the first time, Graham wondered if there was some sort of processing unit&#x2014;�some sort of filter&#x2014;�missing from Audra&#x2019;s brain. She said things like this all the time without realizing how they sounded, and now here was poor Brady Shannon, getting turned on in Frozen Foods.<br><br>&#x201c;Anyway,&#x201d; Audra said, oblivious, &#x201c;how have you been?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d; Brady sounded disappointed. He probably hoped that Audra would go on describing what she did in the shower. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m all right.&#x201d;<br><br>Audra touched Brady&#x2019;s arm. &#x201c;And please tell me how dear Ellen is.&#x201d;<br><br>Okay, now first of all, Graham happened to know that Audra didn&#x2019;t say things like &#x201c;dear Ellen.&#x201d; Except that she just did. Second, Graham would have bet that Brady didn&#x2019;t like it when people said things like &#x201c;dear Ellen.&#x201d; But he had just liked it when Audra said it. Third, Ellen was a cat.<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s coming along, I guess.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Bladder infections can be very serious,&#x201d; Audra said.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t I know it,&#x201d; Brady said, shaking his head and tsking.<br><br>Audra and Brady talked some more about dear Ellen&#x2019;s urinary tract, and health problems among the elderly cat population in general, and the astronomical cost of veterinary care, and Brady&#x2019;s aunt Linda, who had had a bad run of UTIs herself recently, and the time Audra drank cranberry juice nonstop for a week and turned out not to have a UTI at all and&#x2014;�<br><br>Finally, finally, they got to the checkout lines.<br><br>Audra said, &#x201c;Now, let me see if Jordan&#x2019;s working. Oh, yes, he is! Let&#x2019;s get in his line. Come this way.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s Jordan?&#x201d; Graham asked, maneuvering their cart with some difficulty.<br><br>&#x201c;The checkout guy.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, yes, but why do we need to be in his line?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Just a minute,&#x201d; Audra said. &#x201c;Here.&#x201d; She pulled the front of the cart to a checkout line near the door. The customer in front of them was just putting the last of her groceries on the conveyor belt.<br><br>&#x201c;Audra,&#x201d; Graham said again. &#x201c;Why&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>Audra squeezed around the front of their grocery cart so that she was standing right next to Graham and spoke in a low voice. &#x201c;I thought I told you this but maybe not.&#x201d; Her breath on his face was as warm and soft as clover. &#x201c;I was here a couple of weeks ago and Jordan was ringing up this man&#x2019;s produce and the man had bought some pears but Jordan accidentally hit the wrong button and rang them up as these superexpensive Asian pears and the man got very huffy&#x2014;�he really was the most awful man, Graham, very coarse and uncaring&#x2014;�and told Jordan to take the Asian pears off his order and Jordan tried but he&#x2019;d never done it before and the cash register froze and they had to call the supervisor and the man hollered at Jordan and stormed off without even buying his groceries! I thought Jordan was going to cry. I honestly did. He can&#x2019;t be more than twenty, and he&#x2019;s so sweet and defenseless-�looking. So, anyway, now I always make sure to go through his checkout line and tell him what a good job he&#x2019;s doing.&#x201d;<br><br>Perhaps this was the fundamental difference between them. Audra was worried about Jordan&#x2019;s self-�esteem and Graham was wondering if Fairway still had the special Asian pears. If so, should he go get some so they could have Korean short ribs with pear marinade for dinner?<br><br>Audra edged back to the front of the cart and began unloading their groceries onto the conveyor. Graham peered around her to look at Jordan. He was a tall skinny African-�American guy with neatly cornrowed hair and the large scared eyes of a deer. He was painstakingly checking out the purchases of the customer in front of them.<br><br>When they got up to the cash register, Audra said, &#x201c;Good morning, Jordan!&#x201d; so suddenly that Jordan fumbled the can of peas he was holding and had to lean down behind the counter to pick it up off the floor.<br><br>He looked at Audra cautiously. &#x201c;Good morning.&#x201d; He began scanning items.<br><br>&#x201c;How are you, Jordan?&#x201d;<br><br>Jordan paused, a bottle of ketchup in his hand. &#x201c;Pretty good.&#x201d; He scanned the ketchup and reached for a box of cereal.<br><br>&#x201c;I was hoping you&#x2019;d be working today,&#x201d; Audra said. &#x201c;You always do such a good job.&#x201d;</p><h2>Prepare for Anything (Outdoor Life): 338 Essential Skills</h2><p>Are you preparing for the collapse of society?

It&#x2019;s not perfect, nor does it collect massive quantities of water, but it does provide fresh water in arid climates and it can effectively desalinate saltwater.<br> In the original method developed in the 1970s, a square of clear or milky plastic is draped over a pit with a clean cup in the bottom. The plastic at the edge of the pit is sealed with a rim of dirt or stones to keep any of the steam from escaping. The plastic sheet is weighed down in the middle with a small rock, pushed down to shape the plastic into a cone shape. The sun will create a steamy environment under the plastic, and the steam will condense on the underside, running down into the cup below. Each site works for days, and you may get a up to a liter of water per still per day.<br> &nbsp;<br><b>STEP 1 </b>Set up the still in a sunny area with the dampest dirt or sand available.<br> &nbsp;<br><b>STEP 2 </b>Make certain that the point of the cone of plastic is directly over the container inside the still.<br> &nbsp;<br><b>STEP 3 </b>Add vegetation inside to increase production.<br> &nbsp;<br><b>STEP 4 </b>Urine can be recycled by peeing down a hole dug next to the still so the liquid can soak through the ground and vaporize into the still.<br> &nbsp;<br><b>STEP 5 </b>A rubber, plastic, or vinyl drinking tube can be placed in the cup and lead outside the still. This way, water can be sipped as it collects without having to take the whole still apart to get the water out.</p><h2>Petersburg Siege to Bentonville</h2><p>History book.</p><p></p><h2>The Joy of My Heart: Meditating Daily on God&#39;s Word</h2><p>Few Christian writers today bring scriptural truth into everyday life like Anne Graham Lotz.

By the author of Memories of Anne Frank.</p><p>Alison Leslie Gold was born and grew up in New York City. She was educated at the University of North Carolina, Mexico City College and the New School for Social Research in New York City. She has published fiction, non-fiction and journalism, and has also written for radio and television. She has often lived abroad, and presently divides her time between New York City and Greece.Grade 5-10-A moving account of an unlikely hero. Sugihara single-handedly saved thousands of Jewish lives during the Holocaust. With the support of his wife, he issued exit visas while stationed as a Japanese diplomat in Lithuania. Risking his own life and those of his family members, he responded to the call to help fellow human beings. Ignoring the orders of the Japanese foreign ministry, he handwrote thousands of documents so that Jews could flee Lithuania to travel through Russia to get to Japan and freedom. Sugihara was eventually transferred out of Eastern Europe but not before he and his own family experienced the internment camps of Russia. Eventually, he was fired from the foreign service for his bravery and had to find work elsewhere. At the end of his life, he wondered if his act of compassion had any impact. He was rewarded by learning that many of the survivors had been searching for him to thank him for his gift of freedom. Although Sugihara passed away in 1986, Gold was able to interview his widow as well as two people who were saved by his act. Thus, the many details of the book are authentic. The narrative alternates between Sugihara's story and those of the two survivors, rendering the sacrifices and suffering of each person all the more poignant. This thought-provoking title joins the growing number of fine Holocaust titles for young people.<br><i>Carol Fazioli, formerly at The Brearley School, New York City </i><br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Classical World: An Epic History from Homer to Hadrian</h2><p>The classical civilizations of Greece and Rome once dominated the world, and they continue to fascinate and inspire us. Classical art and architecture, drama and epic, philosophy and politics--these are the foundations of Western civilization. In <i>The Classical World</i>, eminent classicist Robin Lane Fox brilliantly chronicles this vast sweep of history from Homer to the reign of Augustus. From the Peloponnesian War through the creation of Athenian democracy, from the turbulent empire of Alexander the Great to the creation of the Roman Empire and the emergence of Christianity, Robin Lane Fox serves as our witty and trenchant guide. He introduces us to extraordinary heroes and horrific villains, great thinkers and blood-thirsty tyrants. Throughout this vivid tour of two of the greatest civilizations the world has ever known, we remain in the hands of a great master.</p><p><b>Robin Lane Fox</b> is a Fellow of New College, Oxford, where he has been a University Reader in Ancient History since 1990. His previous books include <i>Alexander the Great</i>, <i>Pagans and Christians</i>, and <i>The Unauthorized Version: Truth and Fiction in the Bible</i>. He writes a regular column in the <i>Financial Times</i>. He lives in Oxford, England.Greek and Latin may long since have lost their central place in Western education, but the influence of the classical world on our own culture remains very strong. It's there in language and law, and far more vividly present in ideas and ways of thinking about the world. Both the name and concept of democracy came from the Greeks (even if in practice ancient democracies varied massively from each other and their modern counterparts). A century ago, people were fond of comparing the British Empire to that of Rome, and nowadays it is common to look at America in the same way. The great Greek historian Thucydides would have been delighted but not surprised by such analogies; when he chronicled the struggle between Athens and Sparta in the 5th century B.C., he claimed that the events he described would be "repeated in much the same way in the future." <p>In reality, the parallels are rarely so neat, and all too often people twist the past to confirm their own preconceptions. The Nazis used the writings of Roman authors such as Tacitus to bolster their ideological claims about the inherent moral and martial superiority of the German race. That was an extreme case -- at one point, Himmler even tried to seize the oldest manuscript of one of Tacitus's books -- but even today, commentators with different political backgrounds will often draw radically opposing conclusions from the same episode in Greek or Roman history.</p><p>We need to understand the past on its own terms before trying to draw any lessons from it, and for this and other reasons, Robin Lane Fox's splendid The Classical World is to be especially welcomed. Lane Fox, who teaches at Oxford, is that rarest of writers: a distinguished academic who is willing and able to address a general audience. This latest book presents a survey of Greek and Roman culture over some 900 years, beginning with the era of Homer and ending with the rule of the Roman Emperor Hadrian. It is not a narrative history -- events such as the Peloponnesian War or Alexander the Great's campaigns are skimmed over -- but the discussion has a chronological framework, ensuring that we are not presented with a simplistic view of unchanging attitudes and beliefs.</p><p>This is a big book, but the subject is truly vast. In spite of this scope, the book's pace never slackens, and it remains readable throughout. Lane Fox makes no attempt to hide the vast gaps in our knowledge; phrases like "in my opinion" occur frequently, warning the reader that other interpretations are possible, even if there is no time to discuss them. </p><p>Evidence or lack thereof dictates what we can say about the ancient world, of course. Important figures such as the Athenian statesman Pericles remain quite shadowy, and it is very hard to gain a sense of what the great man was like. Not until the entry of King Philip II of Macedon and his son, Alexander the Great, do key characters in the story register more as human beings, although the sheer scale and speed of the latter's achievements will always make him something of an enigma. This changes when we come to the centuries of Roman dominance, when the reader gets far more vivid impressions of men like Pompey and Caesar, Cicero and Pliny, Augustus and Hadrian. This is simply a reflection of the sources Lane Fox has to work with, for biographies and even private letters survive from many of these men (it is invariably a question of men since even the most influential women of the imperial court remain vaguely known figures). </p><p>Although the scope of The Classical World is broad, it deals primarily with the lives and attitudes of the wealthy elite. We know relatively little about the less well off, even in democratic Athens, and we know almost nothing about the poorer inhabitants of other Greek cities. So we do not get much sense of the lives of the majority of the population, although this would be a little more feasible in the Roman era. Three main themes of The Classical World -- justice, liberty and luxury -- are each shaped by the perspective of the upper class. For instance, Roman justice was never supposed to be blind but to take full and favorable account of a person's wealth and status. Or consider another recurring topic, the importance of horses and hunting. Few academics mention such things other than in passing, but Lane Fox -- himself an experienced equestrian and hunter -- justifiably stresses these quintessentially aristocratic concerns. </p><p>Lane Fox's survey deserves to be widely read. Indeed, I cannot think of a better introduction to the subject for those with no prior knowledge. Whether or not you agree with all his interpretations -- and many will not -- no one will doubt that these are the considered opinions of someone with a deep knowledge of the subject. (Personally, I am unconvinced that the Roman Republic "could, indeed should, have survived" Julius Caesar after he had become dictator, or that it would have survived had Mark Antony been assassinated along with Caesar.) Still, Lane Fox's strong and clear narrative will stimulate those reacquainting themselves with this fascinating era as much as it enthralls newcomers. </p><p>Reviewed by Adrian Goldsworthy <br>Copyright 2006, The Washington Post.

Beveridge and Paul Rocheleau<br>Edited and designed by David Larkin<br><br>A man of passionate vision and drive, Frederick Law Olmsted defined and named the profession of landscape architecture and designed America's most beloved parks and landscapes of the past century--New York's Central Park, Brooklyn's Prospect Park, the U.S. Capitol grounds, the Biltmore Estate, and many others. During a remarkable forty-year career that began in the mid-1800s, Olmsted created the first park systems, urban greenways, and suburban residential communities in this country. He was a pivotal figure in the movement to create and preserve natural parks such as Yosemite, Yellowstone, and Niagara Falls; and he contributed to the design of many academic campuses, including Stanford University in Palo Alto, California.<br><br>Today there is a resurgence of interest in Olmsted's work and legacy in both the United States and Europe. This timely volume, following the format of Rizzoli's successful <i>Masterworks</i> series, presents the breadth of Olmsted's work in expansive, beautiful color photographs by Paul Rocheleau, who conceived this book. The engaging text illuminates Olmsted's role as an indefatigable administrator and social reformer, a man who slept a scant few hours each night and rallied around causes ranging from anti-slavery to sanitary regulation. Olmsted's career refelected a deep concern for fostering community and using the restorative effects of natural scenery to counteract the debilitating forces of the modern city. 'Olmsted's goal was to help create an American society where all people had the qualities of gentility,' writes author Beveridge, an eminent Olmsted scholar.<br><br><b>Charles E.

In just six years he managed to seize control of Russia's largest auto manufacturer, largest TV network, national airline, and one of the world's biggest oil companies. When Moscow's gangster families battled one another in the Great Mob War of 1993-1994, Berezovsky was in the thick of it. He was badly burned by a car bomb; his driver was decapitated. A year later, Berezovsky emerged as the prime suspect in the assassination of the director of the TV network he acquired. Although plagued by scandal, he enjoyed President Yeltsin's support, serving as the personal "financial advisor" to Yeltsin and his family. In 1996, Berezovsky organized the financing of Yeltsin's re-election campaign-a campaign marred by fraud, embezzlement, and attempted murder. Berezovsky became the president's most influential political advisor, playing a key role in forming governments and dismissing prime ministers. Having labored to privatize the economy, Berezovsky privatized the state. Based on hundreds of taped interviews with top businessmen and government officials, as well as on secret police reports, contractual documents, and surveillance tapes, Godfather of the Kremlin is both a gripping story and a unique historical document.<br></p><p>Paul Klebnikov tells the incredible story of Boris Berezovsky, a one-time Russian car dealer who assembled a huge--and illicit--fortune after the collapse of Communism. "This individual had risen out of nowhere to become the richest businessman in Russia and one of the most powerful individuals in the country," writes Klebnikov, a respected reporter for <i>Forbes</i>. "This is a story of corruption so profound that many readers might have trouble believing it." Yet <i>Godfather of the Kremlin</i> is a careful work of journalism in which Klebnikov documents the business dealings of a man who once bragged to the <i>Financial Times</i> that he and six other men controlled half of the Russian economy and rigged Boris Yeltsin's reelection in 1996. Berezovsky survived both an assassination attempt and a murder investigation, and paved the way to power for Vladimir Putin. He and the other crony capitalists of post-Soviet Russia like to rationalize their deeds, writes Klebnikov: "Whenever I asked Russia's business magnates about the orgy of crime produced by the market reforms, they invariably excused it by pointing to the robber barons of American capitalism. Russia's bandit capitalism was no different from American capitalism in the late nineteenth century, they argued." Yet nothing could be further from the truth: Carnegie, Rockefeller, and their peers transformed the United States into an economic superpower. Berezovsky, on the other hand, has "produced no benefit to Russia's consumers, industries, or treasury." It's not that he didn't have an opportunity. To pick one example among many, he took over Aeroflot when it had a monopoly position in a booming market. But the company barely grew, and instead experienced myriad problems. Berezovsky controlled many businesses, but he was a lousy business manager; his only authentic success--as an auto dealer--depended on collusion. His real skill is shady dealmaking, especially with corrupt government officials. That's the way to success in modern Russia, as this well-told but troubling book reveals. <i>--John J.

A new land has surfaced and so have old feuds. Discworld goes to war.</p><p>Terry Pratchett is a phenomenon unto himself. Never read a Discworld book? The closest comparison might be <i>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</i>, with its uniquely British sense of the absurd, and side-splitting, smart humor. <i>Jingo</i> is the 20th of Pratchett's Discworld novels, and the fourth to feature the City Guard of Ankh-Morpork. As <i>Jingo</i> begins, an island suddenly rises between Ankh-Morpork and Al-Khali, capital of Klatch. Both cities claim it. Lord Vetinari, the Patrician, has failed to convince the Ruling Council that force is a bad idea, despite reminding them that they have no army, and "I believe one of those is generally considered vital to the successful prosecution of a war." Samuel Vimes, Commander of the City Watch, has to find out who shot the Klatchian envoy, Prince Khufurah, and set fire to their embassy, before war breaks out. <p> Pratchett's characters are both sympathetic and outrageously entertaining, from Captain Carrot, who always finds the best in people and puts it to work playing football, to Sergeant Colon and his sidekick, Corporal Nobbs, who have "an ability to get out of their depth on a wet pavement." Then there is the mysterious D'reg, 71-hour Ahmed. What is his part in all this, and why 71 hours? Anyone who doesn't mind laughing themselves silly at the idiocy of people in general and governments in particular will enjoy <i>Jingo</i>. <i>--Nona Vero</i></p>Something new has come up between the Discworld&#39;s ancient rival cities of Ankh-Morpork and Al-Khali. Literally. It&#39;s an island, rising out of Discworld&#39;s sea, uninhabited and claimed by both cities. Ankh-Morpork has been at peace for a century, and so has Al-Khali. But now there are people on both sides who think it&#39;s time to give war a chance, and will happily help it on its way with a few murders... Modern war needs modern weapons. Unfortunately, Ankh-Morpork got rich making and selling them to Al-Khali. But it&#39;s just possible that salvation lies in the hands of the great inventive genius Leonard of Quirm, whose sketchbooks are filled with devices for killing people, flying through the air, and weighing cheese.</p><h2>Peril at End House</h2><p>The Agatha Mystery Collection.

Beginning with the somber morning of April 26, 1882&#x2015;the day of Darwin&#x2019;s funeral&#x2015;<em>Darwin&#x2019;s Armada</em> steps back in time and recounts the lives and scientific discoveries of each of these explorers. The four amateur naturalists voyaged separately from Britain to the southern hemisphere in search of adventure and scientific fame. From Darwin&#x2019;s inaugural trip on the <em>Beagle</em> in 1835 through Wallace&#x2019;s exploits in the Amazon and, later, Malaysia in the 1840s and 1850s, each man independently made discoveries that led him to embrace Darwin&#x2019;s groundbreaking theory of evolution. This book reveals the untold story of Darwin&#x2019;s greatest supporters who, during his life, campaigned passionately in the war of ideas over evolution and who lived on to extend and advance the scope of his work.16 pages of color illustrations</p><p>Iain McCalman is an award-winning professor at the , where he lives. He has served as president of the Australian Academy of the Humanities and director of the Humanities Research Centre at ANU. He lives in Sydney.In delightful prose, University of Sydney historian McCalman tells the intertwined stories of Charles Darwin and three younger 19th-century explorers who came together to make the case for evolution and aid its relatively rapid acceptance around the world. The younger three were greatly influenced by Darwin's 1839 description of his travels on the <i>Beagle</i> and wanted to follow suit. McCalman devotes a section to the travels of each: Darwin on the <i>Beagle;</i> botanist Joseph Hooker's journeys around Australia and Antarctica; biologist Thomas Henry Huxley's excursions around Australia and New Guinea; and zoologist Alfred Russel Wallace's years in the Amazon and throughout Southeast Asia. Although there's little that hasn't been told previously, McCalman does a good job of detailing the hardships each suffered while also demonstrating the scientific growth each underwent and explaining how their shared experiences brought them together. Once Darwin published <i>On the Origin of Species</i> in 1859, the other three became his biggest and most public supporters, and their tireless efforts changed Darwin's reputation from being the Devil's Disciple to one of England's most respected scientists. 16 pages of color illus.; maps. <i>(Aug. 17)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

And until 1969, I didn&#x2019;t really know her, although when I was the children&#x2019;s-book editor at Holt, Rinehart and Winston, she had illustrated <i>Books: A Book to Begin On,</i> by Susan Bartlett, and <i>Come Along!</i>, by Rebecca Caudill&#x2014;as well as doing for us some of the one thousand book jackets of which she was so proud.</p><p>Our friendship really began in the smoking car (like the title character of <i>Moe Q. McGlutch</i>, Ellen smoked too much) of a Pennsylvania Railroad train en route from New York to Philadelphia, where we were both speaking on a panel. I stopped to say hello, and she said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sitting here alone because I&#x2019;m so nervous. I hate speaking.&#x201d; &#x201c;I hate it, too,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;and I&#x2019;ve given up smoking.&#x201d; In the depressed gloom that followed this exchange, the beginning of a bond was formed.</p><p>That same year I moved from Holt to E. P. Dutton. Their office was located at Union Square and Seventeenth Street, only a short walk from Ellen&#x2019;s apartment on Eighth Street, and we got together more often. One day, Ellen confided that she had always wanted to adapt <i>Goblin Market,</i> by Christina Rossetti, as a picture-book text. I thought of the lavishly rich visual details of the poem, and I longed to see how she would illustrate it. &#x201d;Would you do the book for me?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she answered. &#x201c;Jean [Jean Karl, her editor at Atheneum] doesn&#x2019;t want it.&#x201d; Ellen was always candid. So she did do it&#x2014;her first book for Dutton. One of her exquisitely intricate paintings for that book now hangs on my wall.</p><p>We often talked about our lives, and I particularly loved stories about her family and how she and her parents and sister drove around the country during the Great Depression so her father could look for work, an epic safari that took them from Milwaukee to California. &#x201c;You should write a book about growing up in the Depression,&#x201d; I told her.</p></p><h2>Fix It!

Using papyri, scarabs, tomb inscriptions, mummies, and a rich variety of other primary sources, Eric H. Cline and Jill Rubalcaba uncover the fascinating history of ancient Egypt. Scarabs, which scholars call "imperial news bulletins," record important moments in a pharaoh's reign. <br><br>The Edwin Smith Papyrus details the injuries sustained by the builders of the great pyramids, and the remedies used to treat them. For a worker who has had a stone fall on his head, it suggests: "bind it with fresh meat . . . and treat afterward with grease, honey and lint." A complex recipe for a top-of-the-line mummy describes a process that could take 70 days and involved drawing the brain out through the nose with a crooked piece of iron. <br><br>These primary sources also tell the stories of the people of ancient Egypt: Pepi II, the six-year-old boy king who commanded armies; Ramesses II, whose mortuary temple boasts of his expertise in battle against the Hittites; Queen Hatshepsut, the only woman to rule Egypt as pharaoh; and Cleopatra, who courted Roman statesman Mark Antony as part of her quest to extend the Egyptian empire. <em>The Ancient Egyptian World</em> honors the history of a civilization whose monuments and tombs still capture the imagination of the world thousands of years later.<br></p><p><br><strong>Eric H.

Later she worked as an engineer on the Patriot Missile. Ms. Rubalcaba is grateful to her children, Kelly and Dan, for showing her the joys of writing for children. <strong>Jill Rubalcaba</strong> is the author of several books for young adults, including <em>The Wadjet Eye</em>, <em>Place in the Sun</em>, and <em>The Early Human World</em>.<br>Grade 5-10&#x2013;This book offers chronologically arranged chapters, each of which addresses an important topic in ancient Egyptian culture or history. Geography, religion, the intersection of medicine and magic, fashion and clothing, the arts, and other subjects are explored. Narmer, Hatshepsut, Tutankhamen, Ramesses II, and Cleopatra are among the prominent personalities profiled. The volume is distinguished by its profuse quotations from ancient monuments and ancient authors. Another plus is its broad scope, reaching from the earliest pre-pyramid dynasties through to the conquest of Egypt by Rome. The mostly color photographs are plentiful and, in all but a few cases, sharp. They are supplemented with newly created maps featuring clean lines but relatively few labeled locations. The inviting and informal narrative tone, sometimes employing the second person, seems occasionally too cute for its own good, though most readers are likely to enjoy it. Complexities of archaeology and the unraveling and reassembling of information are, to be sure, simplified, but there is a lengthy list of suggested titles for students who want to know more. The self-contained nature of the chapters also makes this an accessible resource for reports. Overall, this is a fine replacement for older materials.<i>&#x2013;Coop Renner, Hillside Elementary, El Paso, TX</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Its captain proves to be Lord Arthur Kington, whom Bliven had so disastrously met in Naples. On board he also finds his old friend Sam Bandy, one of the Java's pressed American seamen kidnapped into British service. Their whispered plans to foment a mutiny among the captives may see them hang, when the <i>Constitution</i> looms over the horizon for one of the most famous battles of the War of 1812 in a gripping, high-wire conclusion.

Haley<br><br><p>Prologue: The Hound in Blue</p><p>In his cabin at the stern of the brig Althea, Sam Bandy dressed as he sipped the morning&#x2019;s first cup of coffee, rich and full-bodied, from Martinique. Sped into Charleston on a fast French ship with a dry hold, it tasted of neither mold nor bilge water. He was lucky to have gotten it in, avoiding the picket of British cruisers who, in the never-ending mayhem of the Napoleonic wars, sought to sweep all French trade from the seas. It might well have ended in the private larder of an English frigate captain. Now he had brought a quarter-ton of it to Boston, tucked into his hold along with the cotton and rice that one expected to be exported from South Carolina.</p><p>Yes, the life of a merchant mariner suited him, and it endlessly amused him. If one wanted a bottle of rum in Charleston, the cane was grown in the West Indies, where it was rendered into sugar and its essential byproduct, molasses. Thence they were taken by ship and, passing almost within sight of Charleston, delivered all the way to Boston, or Newport. There the scores of Yankee distilleries manufactured the rum, which then had to be loaded and taken back south to Charleston, which was halfway back to the Caribbean. And money was made at each exchange.</p><p>Sam ascended the ladder topside, coffee in hand, snugging his hat upon his head&#x2014;a blue felt Bremen flat cap that a German sailor had offered him in trade for his American Navy bicorn. Sam had surprised the German with how readily he accepted the exchange, for in truth he felt no sentimental attachment to it at all. There were several considerations that impelled him to separate from the Navy. The death of his father during the Barbary War and the disinterest of his brothers placed the responsibility for their Abbeville plantation on his shoulders. And the Navy&#x2019;s penchant for furloughing junior officers for months at a time, and then recalling them without regard for the seasonal imperatives of planting or harvesting, he could not accommodate. Most important, on his voyage home from the Mediterranean on the Wasp, he had brought the daughter of the American former consul to Naples, and she had become his wife. Naturally he wished to provide her and their growing family the gracious life he had known, and shipping provided them a measure of comfort even beyond that of their neighbors.</p><p>And this would be a profitable trip. Their South Carolina cotton for the Yankee mills had brought him eighteen cents per pound and paid for the trip, leaving the rice, some indigo, and the Martinique coffee as pure profit. Topside, he observed his first officer, Simon Simpson, directing stevedores down into his hold. Simpson was astonishingly tall and brawny, dishfaced, with wild black hair; he knew his trade but was not overly bright, but then, apart from captains, what men who became merchant sailors were?</p><p>Their lack of schedule suited Sam; they had tied up halfway out the Long Wharf, selling until his hold was empty, and his taking on new cargo could not have passed more conveniently. As he reflected, Boston&#x2019;s famous Paul Revere was in his mid-seventies, but still innovating, still trying his hand at new business. His late venture into foundry was a rousing success, and Simpson lined the bottom of Althea&#x2019;s hold with cast-iron window weights, fireplace accoutrements&#x2014;andirons, pokers&#x2014;and stove backs. Nothing could have provided better ballast, and atop these he loaded barrels of salt fish, all securely tied down. This left room for fine desks and bookcases from the celebrated Mr. Gould. Upon Sam&#x2019;s own speculation, apart from that of his co-owners of the ship, he visited Mr. Fisk&#x2019;s shop and bought a quantity of his delicate fancy card tables and side chairs, for which he expected the ladies of Charleston to profit him most handsome. Fisk&#x2019;s lyre-backed chairs were in the style of Hepplewhite of London, and when Sam visited Fisk and Son to make the purchase, it caught his ear that more than one patron expressed his pleasure that Fisk&#x2019;s fine workmanship has soured the market for Hepplewhite itself, so disgruntled had people become with the British interference with their trade.</p><p>The Long Wharf, with its glimpse of Faneuil Hall at its head, the taverns he had frequented in their nights here, the dockside commotion, the frequent squeals of seagulls, the salt air beyond his West Indies coffee, all left him deeply happy, but he was ready to go home. &#x201c;Mr. Simpson!&#x201d; he called out.</p><p>Simpson left his station at the hatch and joined him by the wheel. &#x201c;Good morning, Captain.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good morning, Mr. Simpson. The tide begins to run in three hours. Can we be ready by then?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No question of it, we are almost finished.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Excellent. Now, if you please, divert two of those Fisk chairs to my cabin. There you will find on my desk a package, addressed to the Putnam family in Litchfield, Connecticut. Take it to the post office and dispatch it. The Port Authority is right close by there. Arrange a pilot for us, come back, check the stores, and prepare to get under way.&#x201d;</p><p>Ah, the Putnams. Sam did not miss the Navy, but he missed Bliven Putnam. Their midshipman&#x2019;s schooling together on the Enterprise, their learning the handling of sabres together, their fighting Barbary corsairs together, even their fumbling attempts to bridge the cultural gap between Connecticut and South Carolina, and their punishment together at the masthead of the President mandated by Commodore James Barron for their having fought each other all had bonded them in a way that would have been imperishable even had Barron not compelled them to swear their friendship to each other. Sam could not absent himself from the ship for a week, which would gain him only a day&#x2019;s visit to Litchfield, but he could send Bliven a sack of this rich coffee.</p><p>By ten Simpson had returned, and Sam hoisted the flags, signaling his imminent departure. With crew counted and hatch secured, Sam cast off, moving ever so slowly under a single jib and topsail into the harbor. The wind was from the northwest, which could not have served them better.</p><p>At the end of the wharf the pilot boat appeared, a small, sleek, low-waisted schooner, which hoisted Althea&#x2019;s name in signal flags. Sam answered and fell in behind her gratefully. In Boston&#x2019;s shallow bay the tides ran swiftly; once, he visited the other side of the city when the tide fell just to see the sight of Back Bay emptying out as fast as a man could walk; such flats were no place to get trapped. But this pilot very clearly knew what he was doing; the schooner was under a full set, and Sam had to loose his courses to keep up. They passed through the channel between Long and Deer Islands, and could see Lovell Island off their starboard bow. At this point the pilot came about, wishing Althea fair sailing; Sam signaled his thanks and steered east-southeast for the northern curl of Cape Cod. If the wind held, they should round the cape and be halfway down that seemingly interminable spit of sand when dark fell. He would be safe on a southerly course and well clear of Nantucket by morning, when he could set a new course, if the wind permitted, west-southwest for Long Island.</p><p>If it were not for the knowledge of going home, Sam would not relish the southward voyage. South by west was the most direct course to Cape Hatteras, but that would place him in the very teeth of the irresistible, opposing push of the Gulf Current. More distant in miles but infinitely faster it was to steer closer inshore along the mid-Atlantic and follow the eddying cold-water currents that would aid him.</p><p>Their seventh day out, Sam awoke to the accustomed clatter of the cook setting the tray of his breakfast on his desk. He did not mind, for every morning it reminded him of the glorious luxury of not being in the Navy, that every morning there were eggs and bacon and toasted bread for breakfast. On this voyage he did rather feel obligated to share his Martinique coffee with the crew, but it was a small cost to see the men feeling favored, and thus working with a more congenial will.</p><p>He dressed and glanced at a chart on the table, estimating in rough how far they must have come during the night. Topside at the wheel he saw his tall, wire-haired first mate, keeping a firm grip on the wheel in a stout wind from their starboard quarter. &#x201c;Good morning, Mr. Simpson.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good morning, Captain.&#x201d;</p><p>Sam regarded the wind and the set of sails. &#x201c;Steer east-sou&#x2019;east until noon, then make due south.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Very good, sir, east-sou&#x2019;east she comes.&#x201d; Simple Simpson eased the helm a few points to port.</p><p>There was no need to explain why. Their southerly course had brought them almost to the outer banks of North Carolina. Now it was necessary to stand out far enough to avoid those coastal shoals whose locations changed with every storm, shallows that had brought numberless crews to grief, yet not stand so far out as to meet the strongest opposition of the Gulf Current, which here compressed as it rounded the Hatteras Cape and was here at its swiftest. If they made that mistake they could labor all day with their sails bellied full out and end the day not five miles farther on than when they started. It was a delicate calculation, but they would know if they went too far, for old sailors had many times told Sam, and he had himself once discovered the truth of it, that the inner edge of the warm Gulf Current was so sharp and sudden that in crossing it, water brought up from the bow and the stern might be twenty degrees different in temperature.</p><p>At the same moment in the sea cabin of His Majesty&#x2019;s sloop-of-war Hound, twenty-two guns, Captain Lord Arthur Kington in his dressing gown poured himself a glass of Madeira. Two weeks out of Halifax, bound for Bermuda, but empty-handed. They had not raised a single French sail to engage, nor even an American merchant to board and harvest some pressed men. For days now they had been plowing through the drifting mess of the Sargasso Sea, no doubt snagging strands of the olive-brown weeds that would hang on their barnacles and slow them down.</p><p>How in bloody hell could he have fallen from command of a seventy-four- to a twenty-two-gun sloop? For six years he had sailed in purgatory like the Flying Dutchman, each morning asking and answering the same question of himself, unable to break the cycle of it. It was difficult to comprehend how that incident in Naples had precipitated such a consequence. In attempting the apprehension of a deserter from a dockside tavern he and everyone else knew he was carrying out Crown policy. His fault, apparently, lay in attending a diplomatic reception while his press gang was assaulted and bested by a clot of drunken American sailors. No captain of a seventy-four would be seen in the company of his press gang; the notion was absurd, and he the son of a duke. What did they expect of him? Apparently, that his press gang prey only upon victims foreign or domestic, beyond the protective circle of their shipmates. It was his lieutenant on the Hector who had acted imprudently, but in the long-established calculus of the Royal Navy, he as captain should have foreseen such a circumstance and ordered his lieutenant to greater caution. That junior officer had not suffered for the act, he had later been raised from the Hector&#x2019;s third officer to second, but it was Kington himself who, in response to the diplomatic stink that the Americans had fomented, had to be punished. And yet he wondered if there were not more to it, whether some key bureaucrat in the Admiralty had simply conceived a dislike for him.</p><p>At least the Admiralty had broken him in command only and not in rank, an admission that they needed his service as one who would willingly overhaul vessels on the high seas and take off what men were needed to crew His Majesty&#x2019;s ships. The need was bottomless, for desertions were constant, and Napoleon simply would not be crushed. Kington&#x2019;s conclusion was that his value to the Navy lay in impressing men in ways that could not be readily discovered, and in six years at this he had come to excel. The Navy needed him but would not acknowledge him; it was a circumstance that left him feeling ill used. Yet, if he did but do his duty, without complaint, and without overmuch using family influence on the Admiralty, he would work his way back up to his former station. This was certain, for even now a new frigate was waiting for him in Bermuda to take command once he brought in the Hound with a merchant prize or two, and some well-broken American sailors.</p><p>Thus he served, secure in the knowledge that the Royal Navy needed pressed men more than ever&#x2014;and more particularly they needed him, for after that affair with the American frigate Chesapeake, their need for impressment was forced into still greater subterfuge. Infinitely more so than Naples, the Leopard&#x2013;Chesapeake encounter had altered the dynamics of impressment. Doubtless, it had been less than prudent, or at least less than sporting, for Post Captain Humphreys of H.M.S. Leopard to pour broadsides into the unprepared American frigate in peacetime, but it was open and obvious that the Americans had been enlisting British deserters into their crews. The American captain, some fellow named Barron, had been court-martialed and suspended for not fighting his ship to the last, irrespective of the hopelessness of the contest.</p><p>Kington screwed up his mouth into a smile. That said much for the American frame of mind, but not their practicality. Barron had had no chance. His guns were unloaded, rolled in, their tompions in place. His decks were piled with stores in preparation for a long cruise; when approached by the Leopard, Barron, knowing they were not at war with Britain, had not beat to quarters. Had he resisted, his crew would have been slaughtered as they limbered up the guns. As it was, the American was lucky to lose only four killed and eighteen, including Barron himself, wounded. Humphreys had seized four men from the Chesapeake, and then, the worst insult of all, refused Barron&#x2019;s surrender&#x2014;they were not at war, after all&#x2014;and left him there on his floating wreck. God help them if they ever encountered Barron again, he would sell his life very dearly indeed.</p><p>Of the four men Humphreys had seized, one was a Canadian, whom he hanged. They did have some color of justification for taking Canadians, to whom the Americans presumed to grant naturalized citizenship. How dare they? His Majesty&#x2019;s government of course refused to recognize American naturalization. They were naval pretenders even as they were still pretenders as a nation, and no great attention need be paid them except for taking likely-looking seamen.</p><p>Now Kington knew that his exile was at an end; a new command awaited him in Bermuda, but he had concluded that he could not enter empty-handed, and he had turned to the northwest, crossing and riding the Gulf Current into the waters of the American coastal trade. Even as he was thinking they must sight a vessel on this day, he cocked his head at the faint cry above the deck overhead, of deck, sail ho. He straightened his dressing gown and seated himself at his desk, waiting for the rap at his door, which came only a moment later. &#x201c;Enter,&#x201d; he said...</p></p><h2>The Art Book</h2><p>Depicts five hundred paintings and sculptures from the Middle Ages to the present, each by a different artist, in alphabetical order by artist, with a brief description of the work and its place in art history and in the artist&#39;s career.</p><p>There is no introductory essay, there are no comparative illustrations, and there is little placement of these 500 works in historical context. <i>The Art Book</i> is a completely visual survey of the history of art.

A substantial section looks at the story of embroidery, including such masterpieces as the Bayeux Tapestry and the early English ecclesiastical embroideries known as opus anglicanum, the wonders of the post-reformation periods, including Elizabethan black-work and more colourful varieties with metallic enrichments, seventeenth-century domestic furnishings, samplers, and the emergence of stumpwork and embroidered pictures.</p><p></p><h2>The Best of the Joy of Painting With Bob Ross America&#39;s Favorite Art Instructor</h2><p>Introduces the tools, materials, and techniques of painting, and offers sixty step-by-step demonstrations of landscape and seascape painting</p><p></p><h2>The Real Crash: America&#39;s Coming Bankruptcy - How to Save Yourself and Your Country</h2><p><p>Peter D. Schiff has fully revised and updated his provocative <i>New York Times</i>, <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, and <i>USA Today</i> bestseller <i>The Real Crash</i>. First published in 2012, <i>The Real Crash</i> argues that America is enjoying a government-inflated bubble, one that reality will explode...with disastrous consequences for the economy and for each of us.<br>Since 2012, what has happened with our economy? The stock market continues its illusory gains, the Fed "tapers" while some jobs return, and yet the fundamental threat to our way of life has only grown worse-- much, much worse. The United States government nearly defaulted on its debts and the solution was to raise the debt limit-- to spend yet more money, to go even deeper in hock to China, and to burden every American with obligations that are impossible to repay. <br>With incisive analysis and expert financial understanding, Peter D. Schiff reveals that the road we're on will lead to an abrupt devaluation of our currency and a crash that will upend our power, our political system, and our way of life. This new edition of <i>The Real Crash</i> includes more than 35,000 new words of text, which cover:<br>-The 2013 government shutdown, the debt crisis, and how the solution only dug a deeper hole<br>-The IRS political auditing scandal and why the average American should care<br>-What will happen when the government stops inflating the stock and real estate market bubbles<br>-How Detroit's bankruptcy mirrors our national situation: too many promises, not enough revenue<br>To avoid complete collapse, America must drastically reduce government spending, and regulations that drain businesses and suppress economic growth, eliminate costly and unnecessary agencies, stop foreign military escapades, and cut entitlements of all kinds for all classes of people. And, with wisdom born from having predicted the Crash of 2008, Peter D. Schiff explains how to protect yourself, your family, your money, and your country from the even greater crash that lies ahead.</p></p><p><p>PETER D.

He frequently appears as a guest on CNBC and Fox News, and is the host of the radio show and podcast <i>The Peter Schiff Show</i>.

Once that bubble burst and major banks went to the brink of failure, people began crediting me with &#x201c;calling the crash.&#x201d; But what we saw in 2008 and 2009 wasn&#x2019;t the crash. That was the overture. Now we have to sit through the opera.<br>The economic unpleasantness of those days was definitely <i>part</i> of the real crash, but only because of the way our politicians responded&#x2014;replacing one government-created bubble with another, thus putting our economy at even greater risk.<br>The same bubble machine that fueled the last two boom-bust cycles&#x2014;the Federal Reserve&#x2014;is already back in high gear, and we must turn it off. The Fed needs to stop fueling inflation and start sucking dollars back out of the economy. It also needs to let interest rates rise. When the Fed does these two things, Washington&#x2019;s free ride will end&#x2014;it will no longer be able to borrow at near zero interest. As a result, Congress will have to slash spending, fix our entitlements, and generally shrink government.<br>These are the right things to do today&#x2014;they were the right things to do ten years ago. But soon they will become inevitable. We will have no choice.<br>My past books predicted the crash. This book goes a step further and lays out the steps we need to take in order to make this crash as painless as possible and to rebuild in the aftermath. We need to wind down entitlements, eliminate many government functions, and stop playing with the money supply and interest rates. America needs to start making things again, and the government needs to stop taking. As individuals and as a nation, we need to get out of debt.<br>And ultimately, we&#x2019;ll have to face up to the fact that we can&#x2019;t pay off all our debts.<br>The later chapters spell out the solutions, but these first two chapters describe the problem.<br>Our economy today is once again built on imaginary wealth. Like the proverbial house built on sand, it will collapse. When that happens, when America&#x2019;s tab finally comes due, it will probably be as bad, or worse, than the Great Depression. You&#x2019;d better be ready for it.<br><b>From a Dot-Com Bubble to a Housing Bubble to a Government Bubble</b><br>To understand how bad things are and where we&#x2019;re headed, let&#x2019;s quickly go back a decade or so, and retrace the steps that brought us here.<br>Throughout the 1990s, the Federal Reserve injected tons of money into the economy, which fueled a stock bubble, focused particularly on dot-com companies. In 2000 and 2001, when the stock market turned down and unemployment started to creep up, that was a correction.<br>Assets that had been overvalued (such as stocks) were returning to a more appropriate price. The dot-com and stock market bubble had misallocated resources, and while investment was fleeing the overvalued sectors, inevitably the economy shrunk and unemployment rose while wealth became more rationally allocated around the economy.<br>Readjustments in the economy involve short-term pain, just as the cure to a sickness often tastes bitter. Short-term pain, however, was unacceptable to the politicians and central bankers in 2000 and 2001.<br>Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan manipulated interest rates lower. This made borrowing cheaper, inspired more businesses to invest, and softened the employment crunch. But the economy wasn&#x2019;t really getting stronger. That is, there weren&#x2019;t more businesses producing things of value. As there were few good business investments, all this cheap capital flowed into housing.<br>As housing values skyrocketed, Americans were getting richer on paper. This made it seem as if things were okay. In other words, Greenspan accomplished his goal of forestalling any significant pain. By the same token, he also kept the economy from healing properly, which would have laid the foundation for a stronger and lasting recovery.<br>When market realities started to bear down on the economy, and the housing bubble popped, with the broader credit bubble right behind, the government was running out of things to artificially inflate. So the Fed and the Obama administration decided to pump money desperately into government.<br>I&#x2019;ll explore this &#x201c;how-we-got-here&#x201d; story in more depth in Chapter 2, but for now, I&#x2019;ll make this point:<br>Just as the housing bubble delayed the economic collapse for much of last decade on the strength of imaginary wealth, <i>the government</i> bubble is propping us up now. The pressure within the bubble will grow so great that the Federal Reserve will soon have only two options: (a) to finally contract the money supply and let interest rates spike&#x2014;which will cause immensely more pain than if we had let this happen back in 2002 or 2008; or (b) just keep pumping dollars into the economy, causing hyperinflation and all the evils that come with it.<br>The politically easier choice will be the latter, wiping out the dollar through hyperinflation. The grown-up choice will be the former, electing for some painful tightening&#x2014;which will also entail the federal government admitting that it cannot fulfill all the promises it has made, and it cannot repay everything it owes.<br>In either case, we&#x2019;ll get the real crash.<br><b>The National Debt</b><br>As a professional investor, when I study the American economy today, I see debilitating weaknesses. Most obvious is the debt. As this book went to press, the national debt was $17 trillion. That works out to approximately $140,000 per taxpayer. Let&#x2019;s talk a bit about what this means.<br>Whenever the government wants to spend money it doesn&#x2019;t have, it borrows. Our government borrows by selling T-bills and Treasury bonds, or &#x201c;Treasuries.&#x201d; The buyer gets an IOU, and the government gets cash. So, various bondholders&#x2014;individual investors, U.S. banks, the Chinese government, the Federal Reserve, even parts of the U.S. government&#x2014;hold in aggregate $17 trillion in IOUs. These bonds and bills come due all the time, and typically, the Treasury pays them off by borrowing again.<br>Every day, the debt grows. First, it grows because it accumulates interest. In 2010, taxpayers paid $414 billion in interest on the national debt, but that wasn&#x2019;t enough to keep the debt from growing. Another reason the debt keeps growing: our government keeps borrowing more in order to spend more.<br>Barack Obama&#x2019;s $800 billion stimulus in 2009, for instance, was entirely funded by borrowing. In Fiscal Year 2011, the U.S. Government spent $3.6 trillion, but brought in only $2.3 trillion in revenues. The extra $1.3 trillion&#x2014;the budget deficit for the year&#x2014;was paid for through borrowing.<br>As a businessman or the head of a household, if you spend more than you earn in a given month, you&#x2019;re doing one of two things: you&#x2019;re either spending down your savings, or leaving a balance on your credit card. But the federal government has no net savings. That leaves only one option: every dime of deficit is added to our national debt&#x2014;plus interest.<br>State governments are in the red, too. Nearly every state ran a deficit in 2010, and the aggregate of state debt is about $1.3 trillion. Local governments owe a combined $1.8 trillion. Add that $3.1 trillion in state and local debt to Uncle Sam&#x2019;s $17 trillion, and our public debt tops $20 trillion. Much worse, when off-budget and contingent liabilities are thrown in, total government debt tops 100 trillion!<br><b>State of Bankruptcy</b><br>In some ways, our state governments are in worse shape than the federal government. While most states don&#x2019;t have huge ticking time bombs like Medicare, they have just as much&#x2014;or more&#x2014;trouble breaking even.<br>For Fiscal Year 2012, more than forty states were in the red. Twenty-seven states (a majority of states and a vast majority of the country) were running deficits of 10 percent or more, according to data from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.<br>California is probably the most famous of the insolvent states because of the massive size of its annual shortfall: more than $25 billion in 2012.<br>To poison the fiscal waters so completely, it took a special brew of big-government liberalism, anti-tax-hike ballot measures, powerful public employee unions, and ridiculous public pension laws. These factors created what Manhattan Institute scholar Josh Barro calls &#x201c;California&#x2019;s permanent budget crisis.&#x201d;<br>Indeed, since 2005, the California state legislature has been fighting an annual &#x201c;crisis.&#x201d; Barro explains:<br>California&#x2019;s permanent budget crisis stems from institutional failures. Ballot measures have made it nearly impossible to raise taxes or cut spending, and have cemented the idea in voters&#x2019; minds that they can get government services without paying for them. The state has repeatedly failed to reform its inefficient tax code (which relies too much on highly volatile taxes on high-income people, and not enough on property taxes) or to tackle the problem of runaway public employee compensation.<br>California is special in many regards. (For instance, no other state has city managers paying themselves nearly a million dollars a year, as the folks of Bell, California, were caught doing.) But many of the problems with California are present elsewhere.<br>One is the tendency of states to go wild during boom years in revenue. Many individuals who did well during the boom years bought McMansions with huge mortgages on the assumption that every year would be just as good. Many states did the same thing. Nevada is a classic example. Nevada enjoyed faster population growth than any other state in the 1990s and most of the 2000s. This coincided with the nationwide housing bubble, and sent home prices through th...</p><h2>The Days of Abandonment: 10th Anniversary Edition</h2><p><b>From the author of <i>My Brilliant Friend</i></b><br><br>"She is among the greatest Italian authors of recent years."-<i>Corriere della Sera</i><br><br>"Ferrante dissects the personal microcosm so well, and with awesome lucidity and precision shows us the meanderings of a woman's mind, the suffering that accompanies being abandoned, and the awful rumbling of time passing."-<i>El Mundo</i><br><br>"Elena Ferrante has given us a startlingly beautiful novel of exceptional and bold strength."-<i>Il Manifesto</i><br><br>"Severe and rigorously unsentimental, packed full of passages written with dizzying intensity at a rare and acute pitch.

A civic office is spattered by a grisly gun-blast. Two suicides and a murder that just don't add up, unless John Rebus can crunch the numbers. Following a trail that snakes through stark alleys and sad bars, shredded files and lacerated lives, Rebus finds himself up against an airtight, murderous conglomerate on the make in every arena of power. It's leeching the life and soul out of his city and, if it can, him too... <br></p><p>Detective Inspector John Rebus is not a man easily intimidated, so when political heavyweights start to lean on the dour, moralistic Edinburgh detective to stop an investigation, Rebus doggedly digs in and follows the case as it moves from embezzlement to murder and finally to conspiracy at the highest level of government.Praise for Ian Rankin: <p>"Ian Rankin is up there among the best crime novelists at work today.

This book is a portrait of one artist as sublime Rebel. Fortunately, it doesnt have to be a &#34;Best of&#34; collection (though it does contain much of his finest work). Rather, it is a sound representation, &#34;warts and all,&#34; of the writing of someone who is perfectly, vigorously, cast as the Iai of his age. Though Harlan&#39;s work is widely known and applauded, not enough is made of the sense of social responsibility that is central to it. In fact, this dimension often seems to be deliberately overlooked and the major thrust of his fantasy trivialized. He deals in ideas, sometimes so full of love and compassion that they stun with their simple honesty; sometimes set with barbs and hooks that catch and tear and make us gasp and make us feel. Dr. Johnson would have been proud. Shakespeare would have smiled fondly. Because that&#39;s the dimension of achievement occurring here.

Introduction by Hugh Trevor-Roper</p><p>"It was Rome, on the 15th of October 1764, as I sat musing amid the ruins of the Capitol, while the barefooted friars were singing vespers in the temple of Jupiter, that the idea of writing the decline and fall of the city first started to my mind," recorded Edward Gibbon with characteristic exactitude.&nbsp;&nbsp;Over a period of some twenty years, the luminous eighteenth-century historian--a precise, dapper, idiosyncratic little gentleman famous for rapping his snuff-box--devoted his considerable genius to writing an epic chronicle of the entire Roman Empire's decline.&nbsp;&nbsp;His single flash of inspiration produced what is arguably the greatest historical work in any language--and surely the most magnificent narrative history ever written in English.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gibbon is one of those few who hold as high a place in the history of literature as in the roll of great historians," noted Professor J.B. Bury, his most celebrated editor.<br>This three-volume Modern Library edition of <b>The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</b>--with Gibbon's notes--is edited with a general introduction and index by Bury, along with an introduction by Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Daniel J.

Born in tsarist Russia in 1898, she immigrated to America in 1906 and grew up in Milwaukee, where from her earliest years she displayed the political consciousness and organizational skills that would eventually catapult her into the inner circles of Israel's founding generation. Moving to mandatory Palestine in 1921 with her husband, the passionate socialist joined a kibbutz but soon left and was hired at a public works office by the man who would become the great love of her life. A series of public service jobs brought her to the attention of David Ben-Gurion, and her political career took off. Fund-raising in America in 1948, secretly meeting in Amman with King Abdullah right before Israel's declaration of independence, mobbed by thousands of Jews in a Moscow synagogue in 1948 as Israel's first representative to the USSR, serving as minister of labor and foreign minister in the 1950s and 1960s, Golda brought fiery oratory, plainspoken appeals, and shrewd deal-making to the cause to which she had dedicated her life&#x2014;the welfare and security of the State of Israel and its inhabitants.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As prime minister, Golda negotiated arms agreements with Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger and had dozens of clandestine meetings with Jordan's King Hussein in the unsuccessful pursuit of a land-for-peace agreement with Israel's neighbors. But her time in office ended in tragedy, when Israel was caught off guard by Egypt and Syria's surprise attack on Yom Kippur in 1973. Analyzing newly available documents from Israeli government archives, Francine Klagsbrun looks into whether Golda could have prevented that war and whether in its darkest days she contemplated using nuclear force. Resigning in the war's aftermath, she spent her final years keeping a hand in national affairs and bemusedly enjoying international acclaim. Klagsbrun's superbly researched and masterly recounted story of Israel's founding mother gives us a Golda for the ages.</p><p><b>FRANCINE KLAGSBRUN</b> is the author of more than a dozen books, including <i>The Fourth Commandment: Remember the Sabbath Day </i>and<i> Married People: Staying Together in the Age of Divorce.

Wherever Golda set foot, she was received with a bursting exuberance no Israeli premier before her had experienced. In Philadelphia, where she arrived on Sep�tember 24, 1969, a crowd of five thousand met her at the airport, many of them schoolchildren carrying posters that read, GOLDA A GO GO or WE DIG YOU, GOLDA. Afterward, more than twenty thousand people packed Independence Hall and applauded wildly at the end of her brief speech about Israel&#x2019;s desire for peace. &#x201c;I am wise enough to understand that the applause was not directed to me . . . It was rather an ovation for the State of Israel,&#x201d; she said, with required modesty. She knew as well as anyone that the men, women, and children who swarmed to see her in Philadelphia and every other city she visited were as intrigued by the &#x201c;71-year-old grandmother&#x201d; (as the press frequently referred to her) who headed the State of Israel as they were loyal to that state. Her simple bearing&#x2014;she appeared time and again in the same black-and-white her�ringbone tweed suit&#x2014;and midwestern twang with its faint echo of East�ern Europe made her seem the American dream come true, the local girl made good. The &#x201c;former Milwaukee schoolteacher&#x201d; (another favorite press nomenclature) from an impoverished family had risen against all odds&#x2014;including the odds of being a woman&#x2014;to the highest office in her land. Americans, and especially American Jews, who had admired her earlier as Israel&#x2019;s foreign minister, were swept away by her presence as prime minister. No one doubted that she would hold her own with the president of the most powerful nation on earth. &#x201c;What can you do? She&#x2019;s irresistible,&#x201d; one observer commented. Most people who saw and heard her agreed.<br>&nbsp;<br>Menahem, who was studying in America, came to Philadelphia with his family to meet his mother, as did her sister Clara, who still lived in Connecticut. They had all been invited to the state dinner President Richard Nixon was giving for Mrs. Meir in Washington the next night. On Thursday morning, September 25, a marine helicopter carried her and her party to the South Lawn of the White House, where the presi�dent greeted her before three hundred guests and the first lady handed her a bouquet of roses. She had been apprehensive about this meeting with a new president, Lou Kadar recalled. &#x201c;That changed the minute they met. She looked relieved and so did he.&#x201d; Often withdrawn and sus�picious, Nixon was all smiles as the two leaders mounted a red-carpeted platform for a brief exchange of greetings. Later he wrote that she &#x201c;con�veyed simultaneously the qualities of extreme toughness and extreme warmth.&#x201d; He responded to both, treating her with dignity but also with friendly ease.<br>&nbsp;<br>Her welcome had all the trappings of a grand occasion: a nineteen-gun salute on the White House lawn; the marine band playing &#x201c;Hatikvah&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Star-Spangled Banner&#x201d; (in that order); and a ceremonial review of the troops, with Golda in her thick orthopedic shoes and car�rying her ever-present black handbag as she hurried to keep pace with the president and a bemedaled adjutant army general. At the gala dinner in her honor that evening, she wore a long coffee-colored lace and velvet gown and a strand of pearls, not nearly as chic as Mrs. Nixon in her pink velvet-trimmed dress designed by Geoffrey Beene, but more elegantly turned out than she had ever been. In his toast, the president spoke of the honor of receiving for the first time &#x201c;the head of government of another state who also is a woman&#x201d; and pulled out an &#x201c;old Jewish proverb&#x201d; that &#x201c;man was made out of the soft earth and woman was made out of a hard rib,&#x201d; a corny nod to her proverbial strength. He went on to compare her to the biblical Deborah, under whose leadership peace graced the land for forty years. At the much-coveted dinner, 129 guests dined on sole V�ronique and Chateaubriand, with a dessert of &#x201c;Charlotte Revivim,&#x201d; named for Sarah&#x2019;s kibbutz. Afterward, everyone attended a concert by Isaac Stern and Leonard Bernstein in the East Room, Golda hugging both of them when it ended.<br>&nbsp;<br>The real work of her American visit came in two meetings she had with the president. The Phantom jet fighters President Johnson had consented to sell Levi Eshkol had begun to arrive, but Israel needed more to counter the surface-to-air missiles and other arms the Sovi�ets were sending Egypt. She asked Nixon for an additional twenty-five Phantoms, eighty Skyhawk attack bombers, and low-interest loans of $200 million a year for periods of up to five years. She received &#x201c;no concrete, direct promise&#x201d; about those requests, she told a news conference, but she found that President Nixon had &#x201c;sensitivity&#x201d; toward Israel&#x2019;s problems and the balance of power in the Middle East, and she was satisfied with his assurances.<br>&nbsp;<br>She and Nixon discussed Israel&#x2019;s arms and economic needs in the Oval Office on September 25 and 26. Nixon would later recall his impres�sions of her at those talks. Indira Gandhi of India, he said, &#x201c;acted like a man, with the ruthlessness of a man, but wanted always to be treated like a woman.&#x201d; In contrast, Golda Meir &#x201c;acted like a man and wanted to be treated like a man,&#x201d; with no special concessions to her woman�hood, and he appreciated that. When their meeting began, she smiled for the photographers and made the proper conversation, but as soon as the press left the room, she &#x201c;crossed her leg, lit a cigarette, and said, &#x2018;Now, Mr. President, what are you going to do about those planes that we want and we need very much?&#x2019; &#x201d; From then on, they &#x201c;had a very good relationship.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Indicative of that relationship, they arranged a more direct way of staying in touch. Yitzhak Rabin, who had become Israel&#x2019;s ambassador to Washington a short time earlier, would communicate with Henry Kissinger, Nixon&#x2019;s national security adviser, and vice versa, bypassing both countries&#x2019; foreign policy departments. Minister of Foreign Affairs Abba Eban fumed at this arrangement, as had Golda when Ben-Gurion bypassed her to work with Shimon Peres. Happy with the president&#x2019;s wish for directness, however, she brushed aside Eban&#x2019;s unhappiness.<br>&nbsp;<br>Nobody but Golda and Nixon knew what transpired at their most private meeting, when they spent part of their time conversing on the White House lawn, where they could not be heard or recorded. &#x201c;As to the more substantive matters that I discussed with Mr. Nixon,&#x201d; she was to write in her memoir, &#x201c;I can only say that I would not quote him at the time, and I will not quote him now.&#x201d; They each claimed to have kept notes on their conversation; the president told Undersecretary Elliot Richardson that he had dictated a memorandum about the meeting. Apparently, neither that memorandum nor any other notes were sent to a state archive. They remain hidden or deeply classified. Yet based on memos from Kissinger and others speculating about the meeting, historians have concluded that the top secret subject the two discussed that fall day was Israel&#x2019;s nuclear capability. And through that discussion, they arrived at a historic turning point in America&#x2019;s attitude toward Israel and the bomb.<br>&nbsp;<br>In the early 1960s, after Israel had built its nuclear reactor in Dimona with the help of the French, Golda had pleaded with Ben-Gurion to &#x201c;tell the Americans the truth and explain why&#x201d; in regard to their nuclear pro�gram. Ben-Gurion dismissed such truth telling as naive and dangerous and then found himself hounded by President John F. Kennedy to allow American experts to inspect Dimona regularly. The pressure shifted to Levi Eshkol after Ben-Gurion resigned, and even though Lyndon John�son had less interest in the matter when he took office, the American vis�its continued, with Israel doing its best to hide every trace of its nuclear capacity. Eshkol was also pressed to join the nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty. All that changed after Golda&#x2019;s meeting with Nixon. In February 1970, Rabin informed Kissinger that Israel would not sign the Non-proliferation Treaty, and not long after that talk of American visits to Dimona ceased. Exactly what the two leaders said to each other at that mysterious meeting stayed secret, but Golda presumably acknowledged that Israel had the capability to produce nuclear weapons. Nixon seems to have accepted this fact on condition that Israel keep the program under wraps, carrying out no public tests and making no public state�ments about it.<br>&nbsp;<br>Whatever the precise terms of the Meir-Nixon agreement, from then on Israel maintained a policy of vagueness, <i>amimut, </i>or &#x201c;nuclear opacity,&#x201d; in the words of Avner Cohen, a leading expert on the subject, neither admitting to having the capability nor denying it. That policy has con�tinued to govern Israel&#x2019;s handling of the bomb and to shape America&#x2019;s acceptance of it as a reality in that country. Ironically, at a National Press Club appearance in Washington, a journalist asked Golda whether Israel would ever employ nuclear weapons if its survival were in jeopardy, to which she quipped, &#x201c;We haven&#x2019;t done so badly with conventional weapons.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Their two days of meetings ended, Golda Meir and Richard Nixon spoke to the Washington press corps. They had no new decisions to announce, Nixon said, but they had made progress toward a better understanding of each other. Golda said she was going home with a lighter heart than she had coming. She had &#x201c;found in the President of the United States a friend of Israel&#x201d; with full understanding of the coun�try&#x2019;s &#x201c;problems and difficulties.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>She did not go directly home. After two more days of meetings with various government officials, appearing on the prestigious television show <i>Meet the Press, </i>and visiting with Jewish community leaders, she headed to New York City and a whirlwind lovefest. A crowd of fifteen thousand turned out at City Hall Park, many arriving in chartered buses from New Jersey and Connecticut, to catch a glimpse of her. On Tues�day evening, September 30, Mayor John Lindsay hosted a black-tie dinner for her at the Brooklyn Museum (she wore the same gown as she had in Washington). With twelve hundred guests, several hundred more than had been invited for the shah of Iran, it was the largest and most expensive dinner the city had ever given. &#x201c;Sure, it&#x2019;s very high,&#x201d; the com�missioner of public events replied to criticism of its cost. &#x201c;But you had the head of Israel here and the expense of kosher cooking.&#x201d; (In contrast to the nonkosher presidential dinner at the White House.)<br>&nbsp;<br>During her three jam-packed days in New York, Golda attended a luncheon in her honor given by the UN&#x2019;s secretary-general, U Thant, hosted Governor Nelson Rockefeller at her Waldorf Astoria suite, con�ferred with Secretary of State William Rogers, appeared on the <i>Today </i>show, held private sessions with the editors of <i>Time </i>and <i>Life </i>and execu�tives of <i>The New York Times, </i>had breakfast with <i>Newsweek </i>editors, and lunched with broadcasting executives. When she appeared at a rally of almost four thousand Jewish high school and college students at Madison Square Garden, she received a ten-minute standing ovation. An overflow audience of two thousand massed outside to cheer her as she came and left. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s overwhelming,&#x201d; she said, beaming, of her New York reception. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s beyond anything I ever dreamed of.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>And off she flew, in an El Al airplane, to a star-studded dinner in Los Angeles, where Governor Ronald Reagan shared the dais with her and the actor Gregory Peck asked her to dance. (She declined, regretfully.) Addressing the glittering audience, she told of how she had been kept so busy in New York that she did not have time to go to Macy&#x2019;s basement to buy pots and pans, the way she used to. They loved it. When she turned serious, she spoke of her willingness to travel anywhere to make peace with Arab leaders. The problem was that what the Arabs wanted &#x201c;could not be settled by compromise&#x2014;they want us dead. We have decided to stay alive.&#x201d; It was a line she repeated often, with variations, especially to the press.</p><h2>Halo: Cryptum: Book One of the Forerunner Saga</h2><p><p><b><i>Halo: Cryptum</i> by Greg Bear is a tale of life, death, intergalactic horror, exile, and maturity.

The bubbling clockwork song died out with a series of clicks and sad groans; it hadn&#x2019;t been working well to begin with. <br>Twenty kilometers away, the central peak of Djamonkin Crater rose through blue-gray haze, its tip outlined in ruddy gold by the last of the setting sun. A single brilliant moon rose bright and cold behind our boat. The crater&#x2019;s inland lake rippled around the hull in ways no tide or wind had ever moved water. Under the swells and whorls, sparkling with reflected sunset and moon, pale merse twisted and bobbed like the lilies in my mother&#x2019;s pond. These lilies, however, weren&#x2019;t passive flowers, but sleeping krakens growing in the shallows on thick stalks. Ten meters wide, their thickened, muscular edges were rimmed with black teeth the length of my forearm. <br>We sailed over a garden of clannish, self-cloning monsters. They covered the entire flooded floor of the crater, skulking just below the surface and very defensive of their territory. Only boats that sang the lulling song the merse used to keep peace among themselves could cross these waters unmolested. And now it seemed our tunes were out of date. <br>The young human I knew as Chakas crossed the deck, clutching his palm-frond hat and shaking his head. We stood side by side and stared out over the rail, watching the merse writhe and churn. Chakas&#x2014;bronze-skinned, practically hairless, and totally unlike the bestial image of humans my tutors had impressed upon me&#x2014;shook his head in dismay. &#x201c;They swear they&#x2019;re using the newest songs,&#x201d; he murmured. &#x201c;We shouldn&#x2019;t move until they figure it out.&#x201d; <br>I eyed the crew on the bow, engaged in whispered argument. &#x201c;You assured me they were the best,&#x201d; I reminded him. <br>He regarded me with eyes like polished onyx and swept his hand through a thick thatch of black hair that hung in back to his neck, cut perfectly square. &#x201c;My father knew their fathers.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You trust your father?&#x201d; I asked. <br>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t seen my real father in three years,&#x201d; I said. <br>&#x201c;Is that sad, for you?&#x201d; the young human asked. <br>&#x201c;He sent me <i>there</i>.&#x201d; I pointed to a bright russet point in the black sky. &#x201c;To learn discipline.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Shh- <i>shhaa</i>!&#x201d; The Florian&#x2014;a smaller variety of human, half Chakas&#x2019;s height&#x2014;scampered from the stern on bare feet to join us. I had never known a species to vary so widely yet maintain such an even level of intelligence. His voice was soft and sweet, and he made delicate signs with his fingers. In his excitement, he spoke too rapidly for me to understand. <br>Chakas interpreted. &#x201c;He says you need to take off your armor. It&#x2019;s upsetting the merse.&#x201d; <br>At first, this was not a welcome suggestion. Forerunners of all rates wear body-assist armor through much of their lives. The armor protects us both physically and medically. In emergencies, it can suspend a Forerunner until rescue, and even provide nourishment for a time. It allows mature Forerunners to connect to the Domain, from which all Forerunner knowledge can flow. Armor is one of the main reasons that Forerunners live so long. It can also act as friend and advisor. <br>I consulted with my ancilla, the armor&#x2019;s disembodied intelligence and memory&#x2014;a small bluish figure in the back of my thoughts. <br>&#x201c;This was anticipated,&#x201d; she told me. &#x201c;Electrical and magnetic fields, other than those generated by the planet&#x2019;s natural dynamics, drive these organisms into splashing fury. That is why the boat is powered by a primitive steam engine.&#x201d; <br>She assured me that the armor would be of no value to humans, and that at any rate she could guard against its misuse. The rest of the crew watched with interest. I sensed this might be a sore point. The armor would power down, of course, once I removed it. For all our sakes, I would have to go naked, or nearly so. I halfway managed to convince myself this could only enhance the adventure. <br>The Florian set to work weaving me a pair of sandals from reeds used to plug leaks. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Of all my father&#x2019;s children, I was the most incorrigible. In itself this was not an ill mark or even unusual. Manipulars of promise often show early rebellion&#x2014;the stamp in raw metal from which the discipline of a full rate is honed and shaped. <br>But I exceeded even my father&#x2019;s ample patience; I refused to learn and advance along any of the proper Forerunner curves: intensive training, bestowal to my rate, mutation to my next form, and finally, espousal to a nascent triad&nbsp;&#x2026; where I would climb to the zenith of maturity. <br>None of that attracted me. I was more far interested in adventure and the treasures of the past. Historic glory shined so much brighter in my eyes; the present seemed empty. <br>And so at the end of my sixth year, frustrated beyond endurance by my stubbornness, my father traded me to another family, in another part of the galaxy, far from the Orion complex where my peoples were born. <br>For the last three years, the system of eight planets around a minor yellow star&#x2014;and in particular, the fourth, a dry, reddish desert world called Edom&#x2014;became my home. Call it exile. I called it escape. I knew my destiny lay elsewhere. <br>When I arrived on Edom, my swap-father, following tradition, equipped my armor with one of his own ancillas to educate me to the ways of my new family. At first I thought this new ancilla would be the most obvious face of my indoctrination&#x2014;just another shackle in my prison, harsh and unsympathetic. But she soon proved something else entirely, unlike any ancilla I had ever experienced. <br>During my long periods of tutoring and regimented exercise, she drew me out, traced my rough rebellion back to its roots&#x2014;but also showed me my new world and new family in the clear light of unbiased reason. <br>&#x201c;You are a Builder sent to live among Miners,&#x201d; she told me. &#x201c;Miners are rated below Builders, but they are sensible, proud and strong. Miners know the raw, inner ways of worlds. Respect them, and they will treat you well, teach you what they know, and return you to your family with all the discipline and skills a Manipular needs to advance.&#x201d; <br>After two years of generally impeccable service, guiding my reeducation while at the same time relieving my stultifying existence with a certain dry wit, she came to discern a pattern in my questions. Her response was unexpected. <br>The first sign of my ancilla&#x2019;s strange favor was her opening of my swap-family&#x2019;s archives. Ancillas are charged with the maintenance of all records and libraries, to ease access to any information a member of the family might need, however ancient and obscure. &#x201c;Miners, you know, delve deep. Treasure, as you call it, is frequently in their way. They recover, record, settle the matter with the proper authorities&nbsp;&#x2026; and move on. They are not curious, but their records are sometimes <i>very</i> curious.&#x201d; <br>I spent happy hours studying the old records, and learned much more about Precursor remnants, as well as the archaeology of Forerunner history. <br>Here it was that I picked up hints of lore discouraged or forgotten elsewhere&#x2014;not always in actual evidence, but deduced from this and that odd fact. <br>And in that next year, my ancilla measured and judged me. <br>One dry and dusty day, as I climbed the gentle slope of Edom&#x2019;s largest volcano, imagining that in the vast caldera was hidden some great secret that would redeem me in the eyes of my family and justify my existence&#x2014;my common state of pointless fugue&#x2014;she broke ancilla code in a shocking manner. <br>She confessed that she had once, a thousand years ago, been part of the retinue of the Librarian. Of course, I knew about the greatest Lifeworker of all. I wasn&#x2019;t completely ignorant. Lifeworkers&#x2014;experts on living things and medicine&#x2014;rank below both Builders and Miners, but just above Warriors. And the highest rank of Lifeworker is Lifeshaper. The Librarian was one of just three Lifeworkers ever honored with that rank. <br>The ancilla&#x2019;s memory of her time with the Librarian had supposedly been expunged when the Librarian&#x2019;s foundation traded her to my swap-family, as part of a general cultural exchange; but now, fully reawakened to her past, it seemed she was prepared to conspire with me. <br>She told me: &#x201c;There is a world just a few hours&#x2019; journey from Edom where you might find what you seek. Nine thousand years ago, the Librarian established a research station in this system. It is still a topic of discussion among the Miners, who of course disapprove. Life is ever so much more slippery than rocks and gases.&#x201d; <br>This station was located on the system&#x2019;s third planet, known as Erde-Tyrene: a forsaken place, obscure, sequestered, and both the origin and final repository of the last of a degraded species called <i>human.</i> <br>My ancilla&#x2019;s motives, it seemed, were even more deviant than my own. Every few months, a craft lifted away from Edom to carry supplies downstar to Erde-Tyrene. She did not precisely inform me of what I would find there, but through hints and clues led me to decide it was major. <br>With her help, I made my way through the labyrinthine hallways and tunnels to the shipping platform, smuggled myself onto the cramped craft, reset the codes to conceal my extra mass&#x2014;and lifted away to Erde-Tyrene. <br>I was now much more than just a rebellious Manipular. I had become a hijacker, a pirate&nbsp;&#x2026; And was astonished at how easy it was! Too easy, perhaps. <br>Still, I could not believe an ancilla would lead a Forerunner into a trap. That was contrary to their design, their programming&#x2014;everything about their nature. Ancillas serve their masters faithfully at all times. <br>What I could not foretell was that I was not her master, and never had been. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>I stripped down reluctantly, unwinding the torso spiral, then the shoulder and arm guards, and finally the leg guards and boots. The thin pale fuzz on my arms and legs prickled in the breeze. My neck and ears suddenly itched. Then, <i>everything</i> itched, and I had to force myself to ignore it. <br>The armor assumed a loose mold of my body as it slumped to the deck. I wondered if the ancilla would now go dormant, or whether she would continue with her own inner processes. This was the first time I had been without her guidance in three years. <br>&#x201c;Good,&#x201d; Chakas said. &#x201c;The crew will keep it safe for you.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure they will,&#x201d; I said. <br>Chakas and the little Florian&#x2014;in their own language, specimens, respectively, of cha <i>manune</i> and ha <i>manune</i>&#x2014;scrambled to the bow, where they joined the five crew members already there and argued in low whispers. Anything louder and the merse might attack whether or not the boat sang the proper song. Merse hated many things, but they especially hated excess noise. After storms, it was said they were upset for days, and passage over the inland sea became impossible. <br>Chakas returned, shaking his head. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re going to try pumping out some songs from three moons past,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Merse rarely invent new tunes. It&#x2019;s a kind of cycle.&#x201d; <br>With a sharp lurch, the boat spun about on its mast axis. I dropped to the deck and lay beside my armor. I had paid the humans well. Chakas had heard strange tales of ancient forbidden zones and secret structures within Djamonkin Crater. <br>My researches among the Miners&#x2019; files had led me to believe there was a decent chance there was real treasure on Erde-Tyrene, perhaps the most sought-after treasure of all, the Organon&#x2014;the device which could reactivate all Precursor artifacts. It had all seemed to fit together&#x2014;until now. Where had I been guided wrong? <br>After a jaunt across sixty light-years and a second, trivial journey of a hundred million kilometers, I might never get any closer to my ultimate goal. <br>Merse broke the surface on our starboard side, flexing gray-purple fans and shedding ribbons of water. I could hear long black teeth gnawing at the wooden hull. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>The journey from Edom to Erde-Tyrene took a long and boring forty-eight hours, entry into slipspace being deemed unnecessary for a routine supply trip across so short a distance. <br>My first live view of the planet, through the open port of the supply craft, revealed a glowing, jewel-like orb of greens and browns and deep blues. Much of the northern hemisphere was lost in cloud and glacier. The third planet was passing through a period of deep cooling and expanding ice floes. Compared with Edom, long past its best eon, Erde-Tyrene was a neglected paradise. <br>Certainly wasted on humans. I queried my ancilla about the truth of their origins. She responded that to the best of Forerunner research, humans had indeed first arisen on Erde-Tyrene, but over fifty thousand years ago had moved their interstellar civilization outward along the galactic arm, perhaps to flee early Forerunner control. Records from those ages were sparse. <br>The supply ship landed at the main research station north of Marontik, the largest human community. The station was automated and empty but for a family of lemurs, who had set up residence in a long-abandoned barracks. It seemed the rest of civilization had forgotten about this place. I was the only Forerunner on the planet, and that was fine with me. <br>I set out on foot across the last stretch of grassland and prairie and arrived at midday on the trash-heaped outskirts of the city. <br>Marontik, located at the confluence of two great rivers, was hardly a city at all by Forerunner standards. Wooden shacks and mud huts, some three or four stories tall, were arranged on either side of alleys branching into other alleys, winding in no particular direction. This crowded collection of primitive hovels spread over dozens of square kilometers. It would have been easy for a young Forerunner to become lost, but my ancilla guided me with unerring skill. <br>I wandered the streets for several hours, a minor curiosity to the inhabitants but no more. I passed a doorway opening to underground passages from which rose noxious smells.

She is the author of seventeen books of fiction and nonfiction, including <i>The Artist's Way</i>, <i>The Vein of Gold</i>, and <i>The Right to Write</i>, her bestselling works on the creative process. A novelist, playwright, songwriter, and poet, she has multiple credits in theater, film, and television.Whether you're a professional artist or simply looking to engage with your creative spirit, WALKING IN THIS WORLD has something to offer. A sequel to THE ARTIST'S WAY, which held out the promise that a creative journey is a spiritual journey, Cameron's new work builds on the same core techniques, with the addition of one new element--the weekly walk. Barbara Caruso narrates in a conversational tone, speaking directly and enthusiastically. Since the program is designed as a course with weekly components, it would have been helpful to have each component on a separate disc, or, at least, to have an indication on the packaging or the discs where each new component begins. Nevertheless, the audio format, especially in the excellent care of Caruso, is a good choice for exploring this program.

His first book, <i>The Joy of Living</i>, was a <i>New York Times </i>bestseller hailed as &#x201c;compelling, readable, and informed&#x201d; (<i>Buddhadharma</i>) and praised by Richard Gere, Lou Reed, and Julian Schnabel for its clarity, wit, and unique insight into the relationship between science and Buddhism.<br><br>His new book, <i>Joyful Wisdom, </i>addresses the timely and timeless problem of anxiety in our everyday lives. &#x201c;From the 2,500-year-old perspective of Buddhism,&#x201d; Yongey Mingyur writes, &#x201c;every chapter in human history could be described as an &#x2018;age of anxiety.&#x2019; The anxiety we feel now has been part of the human condition for centuries.&#x201d; So what do we do? Escape or succumb? Both routes inevitably lead to more complications and problems in our lives. &#x201c;Buddhism,&#x201d; he says, &#x201c;offers a third option. We can look directly at the disturbing emotions and other problems we experience in our lives as stepping-stones to freedom. Instead of rejecting them or surrendering to them, we can befriend them, working through them to reach an enduring authentic experience of our inherent wisdom, confidence, clarity, and joy.&#x201d;<br><br>Divided into three parts like a traditional Buddhist text, <i>Joyful Wisdom </i>identifies the sources of our unease, describes methods of meditation that enable us to transform our experience into deeper insight, and applies these methods to common emotional, physical, and personal problems. The result is a work at once wise, anecdotal, funny, informed, and graced with the author&#x2019;s irresistible charm.</p><p>Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche, celebrated Tibetan Buddhist master and author of the internationally acclaimed <i>The Joy of Living</i>, is deeply versed in the practical and philosophical disciplines of the ancient tradition of Tibetan Buddhism. He is perhaps best known for his accessible style, his self-deprecating humor, and his ability to address human weakness with deeply personal understanding and compassion.

I lay on a flat examination table that slid like a tongue inside the hollow cylinder which, I was told, held the scanning equipment. My arms, legs, and head were restrained so that it was nearly impossible to move, and a bite guard was inserted into my mouth to keep my jaws from moving. All the preparation--being strapped onto the table and so forth--was fairly interesting, since the technicians very courteously explained what they were doing and why. Even the sensation of being inserted into the machine was somewhat soothing, though I could see how someone with a very active imagination might feel as though he or she were being swallowed.<br>Inside the machine, however, it rapidly grew quite warm. Strapped in as I was, I couldn't wipe away any stray beads of sweat that crawled down my face. Scratching an itch was out of the question--and it's pretty amazing how itchy the body can get when there's not the slightest opportunity to scratch. The machine itself made a loud whirring noise like a siren.&nbsp; <br>Given these conditions, I suspect that spending an hour or so inside an fMRI scanner isn't something many people would choose to do. I'd volunteered, though, along with several other monks. Altogether, fifteen of us had agreed to undergo this uncomfortable experience as part of a neuroscientific study led by Professors Antoine Lutz and Richard Davidson at the Waisman Laboratory for Brain Imaging and Behavior in Madison, Wisconsin. The aim of the study was to examine the effects of long-term meditation practice on the brain. "Long-term" in this case meant somewhere between 10,000 and 50,000 hours of cumulative practice. For the younger volunteers, the hours had taken place over the course of perhaps fifteen years, while some of the older practitioners had been meditating for upwards of forty years. <br>As I understand it, an fMRI scanner is a bit different from a standard MRI, which employs powerful magnets and radio waves to produce--with the help of computers--a detailed still image of internal organs and body structures. While using the same magnet and radio wave technology, fMRI scanners provide a moment-by-moment record of changes in the brain's activity or function. The difference between the results of an MRI scan and the results of an fMRI scan is similar to the difference between a photograph and a video. Using fMRI technology, neuroscientists can track changes in various areas of the brain as subjects are asked to perform certain tasks--for example, listening to sounds, watching videos, or performing some sort of mental activity. Once the signals from the scanner are processed by a computer, the end result is a bit like a movie of the brain at work.<br>The tasks we were asked to perform involved alternating between certain meditation practices and just allowing our minds to rest in an ordinary or neutral state: three minutes of meditation followed by three minutes of resting. During the meditation periods we were treated to a number of sounds that could, by most standards, be described as quite unpleasant--for example, a woman screaming and a baby crying. One of the goals of the experiment was to determine what effect these disagreeable sounds had on the brains of experienced meditators. Would they interrupt the flow of concentrated attention? Would areas of the brain associated with irritation or anger become active? Perhaps there wouldn't be any effect at all.<br>In fact, the research team found that when these disturbing sounds were introduced, activity in areas of the brain associated with maternal love, empathy, and other positive mental states actually increased.1 Unpleasantness had triggered a deep state of calmness, clarity, and compassion.<br>This finding captures in a nutshell one of the main benefits of Buddhist meditation practice: the opportunity to use difficult conditions--and the disturbing emotions that usually accompany them--to unlock the power and potential of the human mind. <br>Many people never discover this transformative capacity or the breadth of inner freedom it allows. Simply coping with the internal and external challenges that present themselves on a daily basis leaves little time for reflection--for taking what might be called a "mental step back" to evaluate our habitual responses to day-to-day events and consider that perhaps there may be other options. Over time, a deadening sense of inevitability sets in: This is the way I am, this is the way life works, there's nothing I can do to change it. In most cases, people aren't even aware of this way of seeing themselves and the world around them. This basic attitude of hopelessness sits like a layer of sludge on the bottom of a river, present but unseen. <br>Basic hopelessness affects people regardless of their circumstances. In Nepal, where I grew up, material comforts were few and far between. We had no electricity, no telephones, no heating or air-conditioning systems, and no running water. Every day someone would have to walk down a long hill to the river and collect water in a jug, carry it back uphill, empty the jug into a big cistern, and then trudge back down to fill the jug again. It took ten trips back and forth to collect enough water for just one day. Many people didn't have enough food to feed their families. Even though Asians are traditionally shy when it comes to discussing their feelings, anxiety and despair were evident in their faces and in the way they carried themselves as they went about the daily struggle to survive.<br>When I made my first teaching trip to the West in 1998, I naively assumed that with all the modern conveniences available to them, people would be much more confident and content with their lives. Instead, I discovered that there was just as much suffering as I saw at home, although it took different forms and sprang from different sources. This struck me as a very curious phenomenon. "Why is this?" I'd ask my hosts. "Everything's so great here. You have nice homes, nice cars, and good jobs. Why is there so much unhappiness?" I can't say for sure whether Westerners are simply more open to talking about their problems or whether the people I asked were just being polite. But before long, I received more answers than I'd bargained for.<br>In short order, I learned that traffic jams, crowded streets, work deadlines, paying bills, and long lines at the bank, the post office, airports, and grocery stores were common causes of tension, irritation, anxiety, and anger. Relationship problems at home or at work were frequent causes of emotional upset. Many people's lives were so crammed with activity that finally coming to the end of a long day was enough to make them wish that the world and everybody in it would just go away for a while. And once people did manage to get through the day, put their feet up, and start to relax, the telephone would ring or the neighbor's dog would start barking--and instantly whatever sense of contentment they may have settled into would be shattered.<br>Listening to these explanations, I gradually came to realize that the time and effort people spend on accumulating and maintaining material or "outer wealth" affords very little opportunity to cultivate "inner wealth"--qualities such as compassion, patience, generosity, and equanimity. This imbalance leaves people particularly vulnerable when facing serious issues like divorce, severe illness, and chronic physical or emotional pain. As I've traveled around the world over the past decade teaching courses in meditation and Buddhist philosophy, I've met people who are completely at a loss when it comes to dealing with the challenges life presents them. Some, having lost their jobs, are consumed by a fear of poverty, of losing their homes, and of never being able to get back on their feet. Others struggle with addiction or the burden of dealing with children or other family members suffering from _severe emotional or behavioral problems. An astonishing number of people are crippled by depression, self-hatred, and agonizing low self-esteem.<br>Many of these people have already tried a number of approaches to break through debilitating emotional patterns or find ways to cope with stressful situations. They're attracted to Buddhism because they've read or heard somewhere that it offers a novel method of overcoming pain and attaining a measure of peace and well-being. It often comes as a shock that the teachings and practices laid out by the Buddha twenty-five hundred years ago do not in any way involve conquering problems or getting rid of the sense of loneliness, discomfort, or fear that haunts our daily lives. On the contrary, the Buddha taught that we can find our freedom only through embracing the conditions that trouble us. <br>I can understand the dismay some people feel as this message sinks in. My own childhood and early adolescence were colored so deeply by anxiety and fear that all I could think of was escape.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>RUNNING IN PLACE<br>To the extent that one allows desire (or any other emotion) to express itself, one correspondingly finds out how much there is that wants to be expressed.<br>--Kalu Rinpoche, Gently Whispered, compiled, edited, and annotated by Elizabeth Selandia<br>As an extremely sensitive child, I was at the mercy of my emotions. My moods swung dramatically in response to external situations. If someone smiled at me or said something nice, I'd be happy for days. The slightest problem--if I failed a test, for example, or if someone scolded me--I wanted to disappear. I was especially nervous around strangers: I'd start to shake, my throat would close up, and I'd get dizzy. <br>The unpleasant situations far outnumbered the pleasant ones, and for most of my early life t...</p><h2>Disease Prevention &amp; Treatment 5th Edition</h2><p>At any given time, hundreds of different health books are offered to the American public. Most of these books provide some useful information, but none adequately address the archaic state of medical practice that patients with serious disease are confronted with. The mission of this fifth edition of <b><i>Disease Prevention and Treatment</i></b> is to break down the barriers of ignorance that result in unnecessary suffering and death. While intriguing discoveries are now published in prestigious medical journals on a regular basis, little of this information is utilized to actually save human lives. It&#x2019;s as if a brick wall separates newly discovered scientific solutions from those in critical need of this knowledge. The goal of <b><i>Disease Prevention and Treatment</i></b> is to tear down the walls of ignorance and apathy that have become the underlying reasons why human beings needlessly succumb to preventable diseases today.</p><p>Starting in the 1970s, the founders of a non-profit group called the<b> Life Extension Foundation</b> began to uncover information that could be used to improve patient outcomes and, in many cases, prevent people from dying prematurely. Conveying this data to those with health problems often resulted in significant improvements in their condition.<br><br> Since then, the <b>Life Extension Foundation</b> has identified enormous amounts of evidence indicating that effective, but overlooked approaches already exist to mitigate many of today&#x2019;s lethal diseases. This abundance of new scientific findings has created the need to publish an updated edition of our <b><i>Disease Prevention and Treatment </i></b>reference book. The <b>Life Extension Foundation</b> has spent tens of thousands of hours reviewing the scientific literature in order to develop the novel approaches to disease prevention and treatment in this book.</p><h2>The Brain Fog Fix: Reclaim Your Focus, Memory, and Joy in Just 3 Weeks</h2><p>A new epidemic is sweeping the country. Some people call it "ADHD," "scatter brain," or "brain fog." And some people simply say they "just don&#x2019;t feel like themselves"&#x2014;and haven&#x2019;t for a long time. People are thinking and feeling worse than ever. Why? Because our brains are not getting the support they need to produce the essential brain chemicals that keep us energized, calm, focused, and inspired. In fact, if you look at the way that most of us live, it&#x2019;s almost as though we had chosen a lifestyle deliberately intended to undermine our brain chemistry. Fortunately, there is a solution. The Brain Fog Fix is a three-week program designed to help you naturally restore three of your brain&#x2019;s most crucial chemicals: serotonin, dopamine, and cortisol. Rebalancing these three brain chemicals will, in turn, enable the rest of your brain&#x2019;s chemistry to reach optimal levels. You will find yourself thinking more clearly, remembering more accurately, learning more quickly, and unleashing the floodgates of your creativity. You will also find yourself feeling more optimistic, calm, energized, connected, and inspired. The good news is that this is easier than you think. Instead of trying to ambitiously overhaul one aspect of your life entirely with some difficult-to-maintain resolution, begin by making small and achievable changes in many different areas of your life.

From this foundation, Goldhagen presents a powerful case that societies must use this knowledge to rethink what and how they build: the world needs better-designed, healthier environments that address the complex range of human individual and social needs.</p><p>By 2050 America&#x2019;s population is projected to increase by nearly seventy million people. This will necessitate a vast amount of new construction&#x2015;almost all in urban areas&#x2015;that will dramatically transform our existing landscapes, infrastructure, and urban areas. Going forward, we must do everything we can to prevent the construction of exhausting, overstimulating environments and enervating, understimulating ones. Buildings, landscapes, and cities must both contain and spark associations of natural light, greenery, and other ways of being in landscapes that humans have evolved to need and expect. Fancy exteriors and dramatic forms are never enough, and may not even be necessary; authentic textures and surfaces, and careful, well-executed construction details are just as important.</p><p>Erudite, wise, lucidly written, and beautifully illustrated with more than one hundred color photographs, <em>Welcome to Your World</em> is a vital, eye-opening guide to the spaces we inhabit, physically and mentally, and a clarion call to design for human experience.</p></p><p><p>One of the nation&#x2019;s chief architecture critics reveals how the environments we build profoundly shape our feelings, memories, and well-being, and argues that we must harness this knowledge to construct a world better suited to human experience.</p><p>Taking an illuminating journey around the globe and into the brain, <em>Welcome to Your World</em> reveals that the built environment and its design matter far more than anybody, even architects, ever thought they did. Using cutting-edge research in cognitive neuroscience and environmental psychology, Sarah Williams Goldhagen articulates the ways in which a room, a building, or a city square affects us, and details our reactions to form, pattern, light, color, sound, texture, and more.</p><p>Expanding on these concepts, she walks us through some of the world&#x2019;s best and worst buildings, landscapes, and cityscapes, from the Parthenon in Athens to One World Trade Center in Manhattan, from Amiens Cathedral in France to Berlin&#x2019;s Holocaust Memorial, from the Luxembourg Gardens in Paris to the 798 Art District in Beijing.

But just as he's packing his bags, Harry receives a warning from a strange, impish creature named Dobby who says that if Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts, disaster will strike.<br><br>And strike it does.

Could it be Draco Malfoy, a more poisonous rival than ever? Could it possibly be Hagrid, whose mysterious past is finally told? Or could it be the one everyone at Hogwarts most suspects...Harry Potter himself?</p><p>It's hard to fall in love with an earnest, appealing young hero like Harry Potter and then to watch helplessly as he steps into terrible danger! And in J.K. Rowling's <i>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</i>, the much anticipated sequel to the award-winning <i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</i>, he is in terrible danger indeed. As if it's not bad enough that after a long summer with the horrid Dursleys he is thwarted in his attempts to hop the train to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to begin his second year. But when his only transportation option is a magical flying car, it is just his luck to crash into a valuable (but clearly vexed) Whomping Willow. Still, all this seems like a day in the park compared to what happens that fall within the haunted halls of Hogwarts. <p> Chilling, malevolent voices whisper from the walls only to Harry, and it seems certain that his classmate Draco Malfoy is out to get him. Soon it's not just Harry who is worried about survival, as dreadful things begin to happen at Hogwarts. The mysteriously gleaming, foot-high words on the wall proclaim, "The Chamber of Secrets Has Been Opened. Enemies of the Heir, Beware." But what exactly does it mean? Harry, Hermione, and Ron do everything that is wizardly possible--including risking their own lives--to solve this 50-year-old, seemingly deadly mystery. This deliciously suspenseful novel is every bit as gripping, imaginative, and creepy as the first; familiar student concerns--fierce rivalry, blush-inducing crushes, pedantic professors--seamlessly intertwine with the bizarre, horrific, fantastical, or just plain funny. Once again, Rowling writes with a combination of wit, whimsy, and a touch of the macabre that will leave readers young and old desperate for the next installment.

More than 100 pages - mostly that delve into my adult relationship with Mother - that were left out of the original version are back in,&#34; said Ms. Crawford. &#34;I&#39;ve also added eyewitness accounts from people who came forward with information after the book was initially published, a preface to reflect the whirlwind that has happened in my life since Mommie Dearest was first published, and an afterword on adoption reform.&#34; When it was released in 1978, Christina Crawford&#39;s Mommie Dearest made an indelible impression on America&#39;s cultural landscape: it enjoyed 42 weeks on the New York Times best-seller list, spawned a cult film classic based on the book, and placed the issue of family violence in the national spotlight. Issues of family violence brought to light then have yet to be resolved today and the book still stands as a catalyst for change. Christina Crawford is an internationally recognized, best-selling author and advocate for adoption reform, the rights of women and children, and a pioneer in making family violence an issue of national concern.DEAD.

For centuries, Tibetans have used fifty-nine pithy slogans&#x2014;such as "A joyous state of mind is a constant support" and "Don't talk about others' shortcomings"&#x2014;as a means to awaken kindness, gentleness, and compassion. While Tibetan Buddhists have long valued these slogans, recently they have become popular in the West due to such books as <i>Start Where You Are </i> by Pema Ch�dr�n and <i>Training the Mind </i> by Ch�gyam Trungpa. This edition of <i>The Great Path of Awakening </i> contains an accessible, newly revised translation of the slogans from the famous text <i>The Seven Points of Mind Training </i>. It also includes illuminating commentary from Jamgon Kongtrul that provides further instruction on how to meet every situation with intelligence and an open heart.</p><p>Jamg�n Kongtr�l (1813&#x2013;1899) was a versatile and prolific scholar. He has been characterized as a "Tibetan Leonardo" because of his significant contributions to religion, education, medicine, and politics."Jamgon Kongtrul's commentary on the slogans is one of the best books I studied. I was relieved that Buddhism was so simple. You can just follow the book and do as it says, which is extraordinarily powerful and such a relief."&#x2014;Ch�gyam Trungpa</p><h2>The Hanged Man&#39;s Song (Kidd)</h2><p>John Sandford author of the phenomenal <i>Prey</i> novels returns with <i>The Hanged Man's Song.</i></p><p>Just about everybody knows John Sandford for his long and successful Prey series. But just as well written and maybe more fun are his Kidd books, of which this is the fourth. Kidd is a professional thief for the Internet age: a cyberprowler, a hacker extraordinaire. In <i>The Hanged Man's Song</i>, he gets word that one of his key contacts--a superhacker known only as Bobby, whom Kidd has never met but has relied on many times--has disappeared. Kidd and an old buddy, both of whom could be compromised by data in Bobby's files, go looking for him. Finding his brutally murdered body draws them into a Hitchcock-esque intrigue that eventually involves stolen government secrets, crooked politicians, and a rogue CIA agent who's as crafty as he is creepy.<p> While filling his tale with fascinating and authentic-sounding lore about the hacker subculture, identity theft, and security cracking, Sandford keeps the action brisk with plenty of white-knuckle chases, tense stakeouts, and hairsbreadth escapes. Couple that with a smart, agreeable narrator and a cast of vivid characters evoked with an old pro's ease, and you've got one winning thriller. <i>--Nicholas H.

Margaretha knows she could never be a spy&#x2014;not only is she unable to keep anything secret, she&#x2019;s sure Colin is completely wrong about her potential betrothed. Though when Margaretha overhears Claybrook one day, she discovers her romantic notions may have been clouding her judgment about not only Colin but Claybrook as well. It is up to her to save her father and Hagenheim itself from Claybrook&#x2019;s wicked plot.</p></p><p><p>Melanie Dickerson is a&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>&nbsp;bestselling author and a Christy Award winner.

Visit her online at MelanieDickerson.com; Facebook: MelanieDickersonBooks; Twitter: @MelanieAuthor.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>Margaretha is the daughter of a fifteenth-century German duke, and her family and acquaintances have always noted not only her penchant for talking incessantly but also her deeply romantic nature. She is looking forward to finding her one true love, and she thinks it might be her latest suitor, Lord Claypool. In a chance meeting with Colin, an Englishman come to the continent claiming that Claypool has murdered good people and seeking justice, Margaretha learns not only that her suitor may not be as honorable as she thought but also that she can successfully pare down her chattiness, keep an important secret, and help take righteous action. She and Colin join forces in a well-paced adventure that pits good against evil, features a strong and credible young woman, and relies on accurate social history in its Christian orientation. Margaretha&#x2019;s sensations, expectations, and fears are all evoked realistically, making this a good choice for readers who loved Katherine Paterson&#x2019;s Lyddie (1991) or Karen Cushman&#x2019;s Catherine, Called Birdy (1994) and are now ready for more romance. --- Francisca Goldsmith (<i>Booklist</i>)<br><br>Award-winning Melanie Dickerson pens her fourth young adult novel set in medieval Germany, loosely based on the story of The Frog Prince. In The Princess Spy, Margaretha of Hagenheim Castle is a talkative young woman whose latest suitor&#x2013;Lord Claybrook&#x2013;seems enamored of her despite her talkativeness. Could he be her true love? When an injured man is brought to the castle, Margaretha realizes he is speaking English and that she is the only one who understands him. As he recovers from his injuries and begins working in the stable, Colin confides he is searching for Claybrook, who may not be who he seems to be. Should she believe a foreigner? Should she spy on her suitor when Colin asks her to do so? Then, while her father is away from the castle, Margaretha overhears Claybrook talking to his men about his plans. Colin and Margaretha flee to reach her relatives in Marienberg. Pursued by enemies, will they reach Marienberg in time to get reinforcements? As in her earlier books, the faith element is clearly evident yet not preachy. For example, Colin and Margaretha pray for God&#x2019;s guidance. Dickerson&#x2019;s tales feature wholesome relationships while still building a strong attraction between the main characters, making this a good choice for teen readers. Dickerson is a masterful storyteller with a carefully crafted plot, richly-drawn characters, and detailed setting. The reader is easily pulled into the story. All of her books are a delightful reimagining of a familiar tale&#x2013;this one is her best so far! Recommended for young adults and adults who are young at heart. Carol R.

Not then.&#x201d; Samuel told me, &#x201c;When you get just so old, those first days blur together.&#x201d; I am not a werewolf, but I can, after all this time, tell when Samuel is lying to me.</p><p>I do know that the events in this story happen a long, long time before Moon Called.<br><br><b>ONE</b></p><p>Three weeks to the day after I buried my youngest child, and several days after I buried my oldest&#x2014;a young woman who would never become older&#x2014;someone knocked at my door.</p><p>I rolled off my sleeping mat to my feet but made no move to answer the knock. It was pitch-dark outside, and the only reason anyone knocked at my door in the middle of the night was because someone was ill. All of my knowledge of herb lore and healing had not been able to save my wife or my children. If someone was ill, they were better off without me.</p><p>&#x201c;I can hear you,&#x201d; said my da&#x2019;s voice gruffly. &#x201c;Let me in.&#x201d;</p><p>Another day, before the death of my family, I would have been surprised. It had been a long time since I&#x2019;d heard my father&#x2019;s voice. But my da, he&#x2019;d always known when I was in trouble. That insight had outlasted my childhood.</p><p>I was beyond caring about anything, expected or unexpected. Being used to doing what he asked, I opened the door and stepped back.</p><p>The man standing outside entered quickly, careful not to lose the heat of the evening&#x2019;s fire. The hearth in the center of my home was banked and covered for the night, and I wouldn&#x2019;t fuel it again until the morning. With the door shut, the room was too dark to see because the window openings were also covered against the cold night air.</p><p>I did not see how he did it because there was no sound of striking flint, but he lit the tallow candle. He had always kept a candle on the ledge, just inside the door, where one of the rocks that formed the walls of the house stuck out. After he had gone and left the hut to me, I found it practical to leave one there as well.</p><p>In that dim but useful light, he pulled down the hood of his tattered cloak, and I saw his lined face, which looked older and more weather-beaten than when I&#x2019;d last seen him, a dozen or more seasons ago.</p><p>His hair was threaded through with hoary gray, and his beard was an unfamiliar snow-white. He moved with a limp that he hadn&#x2019;t had the last time I&#x2019;d seen him, but other than that he looked good for an old man. He set down the big pack he carried on his back and the leather bag that held his pipes. He shrugged off his outerwear and hung it up beside the door where my da had always hung such things.</p><p>&#x201c;The crows told me that you needed me,&#x201d; he said to my silence.</p><p>He seldom spoke of uncanny things, my da, and only to the family&#x2014;which was down to just me, as my younger brother had died four years ago of a wasting sickness. But Da was better at predicting things and knowing things than the hedge witch who held sway in our village. He also had an easier time lighting fires or candles than any other person I knew, wet wood, poor tinder, or untrimmed wick&#x2014;it didn&#x2019;t matter to him.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know how you can help,&#x201d; I told him, my voice harsh from lack of use. &#x201c;They are all dead. My wife, my children.&#x201d;</p><p>He looked down, and I knew that it wasn&#x2019;t news to him, that the crows&#x2014;or whatever magic had spoken to him&#x2014;had told him about their deaths.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, then,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;it was time for me to come.&#x201d; He looked up and met my eyes, and I could see the worry in his face. &#x201c;Though I thought that I ran ahead of trouble, not behind.&#x201d;</p><p>The words should have sent a chill down my spine, but I foolishly believed that the worst thing that could happen to me already had.</p><p>&#x201c;How long are you staying?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>He tilted his head as if he heard something that I did not. &#x201c;For the winter,&#x201d; he told me at last, and I tried not to feel relief that I would not be alone. I tried not to feel anything but grief. My family deserved my grief&#x2014;and I, who had failed to save them, did not deserve to feel relief.</p><p>� � �</p><p>It was a harsh winter, as if nature herself mourned with me. My da, he didn&#x2019;t get in the way of my grieving, but he did make sure I got up every morning and did the things that were needful to get through the day. He didn&#x2019;t push, just watched me until I did the right thing. A man worked, and he tended those things that needed tending&#x2014;I knew those lessons from my childhood. He wasn&#x2019;t a man people gainsaid, and that was as true of me as it was the rest of the village.</p><p>People came by to greet him. Some of the attention was because he&#x2019;d been respected and liked, but more was because he could be coaxed to play for them. Music wasn&#x2019;t uncommon in our village, most folk sang and played a little drum or pipe. But most folk didn&#x2019;t sing like my da. When my mother died, no one had been surprised when he&#x2019;d taken back to traveling, singing for his room and board, as he&#x2019;d been doing when he first met her.</p><p>People brought him a little of whatever they had to pay for his music, and between that and the medicine I traded in barter, we had enough for winter stores even though I hadn&#x2019;t put things back as I usually did. I hadn&#x2019;t been worried about whether there was enough food to eat or enough wood to burn.</p><p>I hadn&#x2019;t worried about myself because I&#x2019;d have as soon joined my little family in their cold graves. With my da here, that route now smacked of cowardice&#x2014;and if I forgot that sometimes, my da&#x2019;s cool gaze reminded me.</p><p>It felt odd, though, not to have someone to take care of; for so long I had been the head of the family. I was not in the habit of worrying about my da: he wasn&#x2019;t the kind of person who needed anyone to fuss over him. He&#x2019;d survived his childhood&#x2014;not that he&#x2019;d spoken of it to me beyond that it had been rough. But my ma, she&#x2019;d known whatever it had been, and it had sparked fierce pride tinged with sorrow and tenderness. I knew only that he&#x2019;d left his home while still a stripling boy. He had traveled and thrived in a world hostile to strangers.</p><p>He was tough, and it gave him confidence that had backed down my ma&#x2019;s folk when they objected to her marrying a man from outside the village. He was smart&#x2014;and more than that, he was wise. When he spoke on village matters, which he didn&#x2019;t do often, the villagers listened to him.</p><p>He&#x2019;d survived traveling the world after my mother&#x2019;s death&#x2014;and he was still lit with the joy that made my home warmer than the logs on the hearth, though the chill left by the death of my little ones and their ma was deep.</p><p>My da, he could survive anything, and his example forced me to do the same. Even when I didn&#x2019;t want to.<br><br><b>TWO</b></p><p>On the shortest night of the year, when the full moon hung in the sky, my grandmother came to us. I&#x2019;d returned to my duties as village healer, so I didn&#x2019;t even think of not answering a knock in the dead of night. Da had gotten used to the middle-of-the-night summonses that were the lot of a healer. He didn&#x2019;t stir, though I was certain he was awake.</p><p>I opened the door to a stranger. She was a wild-looking young woman with hair that flowed in unkempt, tangled tresses all the way to the back of her knees. Her face was uncanny and so beautiful that I didn&#x2019;t pay much heed to the beast that crouched beside her, huge though he was.</p><p>&#x201c;The son,&#x201d; she said to me. The magic flows strongly in you. Her voice echoed in my head.</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; said my da, who had exploded to his feet the moment I opened the door. He stepped between us. &#x201c;You will not have him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You shouldn&#x2019;t have run away,&#x201d; she told him. &#x201c;But I forgive you because you brought a gift with you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I will never willingly serve you, Mother,&#x201d; my da said in a voice I&#x2019;d never heard from him before. &#x201c;I told you we are done.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You speak as though I would give you a choice,&#x201d; she said. She glanced down, and the beast I had taken for a dog lunged at my da.</p><p>I grabbed the cudgel I kept beside the door, but the beast was faster than I was. It had time to bury its fangs in my da&#x2019;s gut and jerk him between us. The only reason I didn&#x2019;t brain Da was because I dropped the cudgel midswing. And after that, there was no chance to fight.</p><p>� � �</p><p>She turned us into monsters&#x2014;werewolves&#x2014;though I didn&#x2019;t hear that term for many years. She bound us to her service with witchcraft and more cruelly through her ability to break into our minds&#x2014;in this she had more trouble with Da than with the rest of her wolves. Though she looked like a young woman to all of my senses, I think she was centuries old when she came knocking on my door.</p><p>The first transformation from human to werewolf is harsh under the best of circumstances. I now know that most people attacked brutally enough to be Changed die. The witch had some way to interfere, to hold her victims to life until they became the beasts she desired. Even so, I would have died if my da had not anchored me. I heard his voice in my head, cool and demanding, and I had to obey him, had to live. That he was able to do this while undergoing a like fate to mine is a fair insight into the man my da is. That I lived was something that took me a very long time to forgive him for.</p><p>I do not know, nor do I wish to, how long I lived as a werewolf serving my grandmother. It could have been a decade or centuries, though I think it was closer to the latter than the former. It was long enough that I had time to forget my given name. I deliberately left it behind because I was no longer that person, but I had not thought to lose it altogether. My name was not the only memory I lost.</p><p>I no longer remembered my first wife&#x2019;s face or the faces of my children. Though sometimes in dreams, even all these centuries later, I hear the cry of &#x201c;Taid! Taid!&#x201d; as a child calls for his father. The voice, I believe, is that of my firstborn son. In the dream, he is lost, and I cannot find him no matter where I look.</p><p>My da likes to say that sometimes forgetfulness is a gift. Perhaps had I remembered them clearly, remembered what I&#x2019;d once had, I would not have survived my time serving the witch. I learned to live in the moment, and the wolf who shared my body and soul made it easy: a beast feels no remorse for the past nor hope for the future.<br><br><b>THREE</b></p><p>Once upon a time, there was a fair maiden of the faerie courts who rode away from a hunting party, chasing something she could glimpse just ahead of her. Eventually she came to a glade where a strange and handsome man awaited her with food and drink. She ate the food and drank his wine and stayed with the lord of the forest even when the rest of her people found her, sending them back to the court without her.</p><p>Time passed, and she gave birth to a girl child who grew up as talented as she was wise. In a human tale, this couple would have had a happily-ever-after ending. But the fae are not human, and they live a very, very long time. Happily-ever-after is seldom long enough for them, and that was true for these two lovers. But for a time they were as happy as any.</p><p>They called their daughter Ariana, which means silver, as she early on had an affinity for that metal. As she grew up, it became apparent that her power harked back to the height of fae glory. By the time she reached adulthood, her power outshone even the forest lord&#x2019;s, and he was centuries old and steeped with the magic of the forest.</p><p>It is true that the high-court fae were notoriously fickle. It is also true that a forest lord has two aspects: the first is civilized and beautiful as any of the Tuatha D� Danann, the second is wild as the forest he rules. The sidhe lady eventually grew bored, or perhaps her distaste for her lover&#x2019;s wilder half became too strong. Whatever the reason, she left her grown daughter and her lover without a farewell or notice, to return to the court.</p><p>The forest lord mourned his lover only briefly, for his kind, too, are as light in their affections as they are terrible in their hatreds. For a while after she left, he still loved his daughter and took joy in her. But when her power eclipsed his own, he grew jealous and spiteful. When the other fae took notice of her gifts and came to her with gold and jewels to entice her to share her magic, his jealousy outgrew his love and made it as nothing.<br><br><b>FOUR</b></p><p>The pack customarily bedded down in the woods behind the witch&#x2019;s cottage. It was mountainous there, but not particularly cold, though winter still held snow and autumn a fine frost. Our coats were thick, and the interior of the cottage was smoky, too warm, and reeked unpleasantly of rotting things both physical and spiritual.</p><p>I don&#x2019;t know about my da or the others, but I was happy to be out of the witch&#x2019;s way as much as possible. She kept us hidden from those who sought her services, both as unseen protection&#x2014;because she dealt with powerful and dread beings&#x2014;and as a precaution because she only mostly controlled us. My da she never let too near her unless she had some of the other, more obedient wolves nearby.</p><p>� � �</p><p>My father, curled up by himself, raised his head as I came back from hunting. He stood and gave me a look before turning and trotting off into the woods where the leaves were ruddy and gold. I hesitated, but even then, the obedience was a part of our relationship. Instead of settling down to sleep until morning as I had planned, I stretched twice, then ran in his trail until I caught up. Though I didn&#x2019;t look behind me, I knew that the others followed&#x2014;as they always did.</p><p>At first I thought the other wolves followed us to spy for the witch, but time had proven that wrong. There were six of us werewolves, seven really, though we all knew that Adda was dying&#x2014;he had trouble stumbling down the trail into the hollow, and I would have to help him up it when we returned.</p><p>I had the impression that my father had known some of the wolves from his childhood, but he never confirmed or denied it. He never spoke to them or of them when we were in human form&#x2014;and they never left their wolf shape.</p><p>Da had found a small sheltered hollow in the lee of a downed oak shortly after the witch had brought us here. It served to keep us hidden and offered some protection from the weather for our naked bodies. Even though my human skin didn&#x2019;t get cold as it had before the wolf entered my soul, skin was not as good as fur. It wasn&#x2019;t winter yet, but the leaves had begun to change to autumn&#x2019;s colors, and there was a bite to the air.</p><p>Da began his change as soon as we were in the oak&#x2019;s protection, but instead of following his example as I usually did, I hesitat...</p></p><h2>The Patient History: Evidence-Based Approach (Tierney, The Patient History)</h2><p><p><b>Publisher's Note:&nbsp;Products purchased from Third Party sellers are not guaranteed by the publisher for quality, authenticity, or access to any online entitlements included with the product.</b><b><i></i></b></p><p></p><p></p><br><br><p><b>The definitive evidence-based introduction to patient history-taking</b></p><p><b><i>NOW IN FULL COLOR</i></b></p><p><strong><i>A Doody's Core Title for 2019!</i></strong></p><p>For medical students and other health professions students, an accurate differential diagnosis starts with <i>The Patient History</i>.

He explains that Capitalism emerged from the English Reformation, reached its present form during England's Industrial Revolution, and from there was exported to the rest of the world. &#x201c;It was in England that the Industrial System arose. It was in England that all its traditions and habits were formed; and because the England in which it arose was already a Capitalist England, modern Industrialism, wherever you see it at work to-day, having spread from England, has proceeded upon the Capitalist model.&#x201d; Belloc also suggests that Capitalism has supplanted another, earlier system, one that had developed throughout Catholic Europe, a system he and his good friend G.K. Chesterton referred to as &#x201c;Distributism.&#x201d; &#x201c;Property was an institution native to the State and enjoyed by the great mass of its citizens. Co-operative institutions, voluntary regulations of labour, restricted the completely independent use of property by its owners only in order to keep that institution intact and to prevent the absorption of small property by great.&#x201d; &#x201c;This excellent state of affairs which we had reached after many centuries of Christian development, and in which the old institution of slavery had been finally eliminated from Christendom, did not everywhere survive.

Breakers were hitting islands or exposed sandbars some distance away from the swamp that he was now negotiating with great difficulty. Ahead of him and almost at the limit of his perception was the midnight traveller -- a dark, moving blotch within further darkness -- who would have been totally lost to him had it not been for the faint orange moonlight, and even that meager illumination was jealously guarded by the streams of moving clouds. </p><p> The man had come this way before, that was a certainty. And more than once. His pace was swift and sure-footed, even without benefit of a lantern. Matthew was up to the task of following through the waist-high grasses and across the muck that pulled at his shoes, but it was a tough and laborious journey. </p><p> They had left Fount Royal far behind. Matthew estimated the distance at least a quarter mile from the watchman's tower, which had been easily circumvented by cutting through the pinewoods. If the watchman had been awake -- and this Matthew seriously doubted -- he'd been looking out to sea. Who would expect anyone in their right mind to venture out into this morass in the dead of night? </p><p> The midnight traveller had a definite purpose, one that gave speed to his step. Matthew heard something rustle off in the grass to his right; it sounded large and quite sinister, therefore he found a little extra speed himself. He discovered in the next moment, however, that his worst enemy was the swamp itself, as he walked into a shallow pond that closed about his knees and almost sent him sprawling. The mud at the pond's bottom seized his shoes and it was only with extreme tenacity that Matthew worked his way to freedom. Once out of the water he realized he could no longer detect his quarry's movement. He scanned from right to left and back again, but the darkness had truly dropped its curtain. </p><p> Still, he knew the man must be going in this general direction. He started off again, more mindful of where he was stepping. The swamp was indeed a treacherous place. The midnight traveller must surely have come out here many times to be able to navigate these dangers. Indeed, Matthew thought the man may have made a map of his route and consigned it to memory. </p><p> After three or four minutes, Matthew was yet unable to spy any movement in the darkness. He glanced back and saw that his course had taken him around a headland. A black line of pines and swamp oaks stood between his current position and the watchman's tower, which was probably the greater part of a mile behind. Beyond him was only more swamp. He debated whether to turn back or forge on. Everything out here was only greater and lesser shades of dark, so what was the point? He did continue on a few paces, though, and again paused to scan the horizon. Mosquitoes hummed about his ears, hungry for blood. Frogs croaked in the rushes. Of another human, however, there was not a sign. </p><p> What was there to bring a person out here? This was wild desolation, hardly a civilized soul standing between his footprints and the city of Charles Town. So what did the midnight traveller seek to accomplish? </p><p> Matthew looked up at the banners of stars. The sky was so huge and the horizon so wide that it was fearsome. The sea, too, was a dark continent. Standing on this coast with the unknown world at his back, he felt more than a little distress, as if his equilibrium and very place on earth were challenged by such immensity. He understood at that moment the need for men to build towns and cities and surround them with walls -- not only to keep out the threat of Indians and wild beasts, but to maintain the illusion of control in a world that was too large to be tamed. </p><p> His contemplation was suddenly broken. Out at sea, two lights blinked in quick succession. </p><p> Matthew had been about to turn his face toward Fount Royal again, but now he stood motionless. A few seconds went by. Then, once again, the two lights blinked. </p><p> What followed next gave his heart a jolt. Not fifty yards from where Matthew was standing, a lighted lantern appeared and was uplifted. The lantern swung back and forth, and then disappeared -- concealed, Matthew suspected, by the midnight traveller's cloak. The man must have either crouched down to strike a match and flame the candle, or done it within the cloak's folds. Whatever and however, a signal had been answered. </p><p> Matthew lowered himself into the protection of the marsh grass, so that just his eyes were above it. He desired a closer view, and began to move quietly and carefully toward where the lantern had been revealed. It came to mind that if he stepped on a venomous reptile in his present posture, its fangs would strike a most valuable area. He got to within thirty feet of the dark-cloaked man and was forced to stop when the cover of the high grass ended. The man was standing on a stretch of hard-packed sand, just a few yards short of the Atlantic's foamy waves. He was waiting, his face aimed toward the ocean and his lantern hidden in the cloak. </p><p> Matthew also waited. Presently, after the passage of perhaps ten minutes during which the man paced back and forth but never left his station, Matthew was aware of a shape emerging from the darkness of the sea. Only when it was about to make landfall did Matthew make out an oarboat, painted either black or dark blue. There were three men aboard, all of whom also wore night-hued clothing. Two of the men jumped out into the surf and pulled the oarboat to shore. </p><p> Matthew realized the boat must have come from a larger vessel some distance away. His thought was: <i>I have found the Spanish spy.</i> </p><p> "Greetin's!" the man who had remained in the oarboat called, his accent as far from being Spanish as Gravesend was from Valencia. He stepped down onto the sand. "How goes it?" </p><p> The midnight traveller answered, but his voice was so low Matthew heard only a murmur. </p><p> "Seven this trip," the oarboater said. "That oughta do you. Get 'em out!" He had delivered this command to the other two men, who began to unload what appeared to be wooden buckets. "Same place?" he asked the midnight traveller, who answered with a nod. "You're a man of habit, ain't you?" </p><p> The midnight traveller raised his lantern from the folds of his cloak and by its yellow glow Matthew saw his face in profile. "A man of <i>good</i> habit," Edward Winston said sternly. "Cease this prattle, bury them, and be done with it!" He dropped the lantern, which had been used to show the other man that he was in no mood for dawdling. </p><p> "All right, all right!" The oarboater reached into the bottom of his craft and brought up two shovels, and then he walked up the beach to the edge of the high grass. His path brought him within fifteen feet of Matthew's concealment. He stopped at a thatch of spiny palmettos. "This where you want 'em?" </p><p> "It will do," Winston said, following. </p><p> "Bring 'em on!" the man ordered his crew. "Hurry it, we ain't got all night!" The buckets, which appeared to be sealed, were carried to the designated place. The oarboater handed the two shovels to the other men, who began to dig into the sand. </p><p> "You know where a third shovel is," Winston said. "You might employ it, Mr. Rawlings." </p><p> "I ain't no damn Injun!" Rawlings replied tartly. "I'm a chief!" </p><p> "I beg to differ. You <i>are</i> an Indian, and your chief is Mr. Danforth. I suggest you earn the coin he's paying you." </p><p> "Very <i>little</i> coin, sir! Very <i>little,</i> for this night work!" </p><p> "The faster they're buried, the sooner you may go." </p><p> "Well, why bury 'em anyway? Who the hell's comin' out here to find 'em?" </p><p> "Safe is better than sorry. Just lay one bucket aside and put the others under with no further argument." </p><p> Muttering beneath his breath, Rawlings reached carefully into the palmettos and pulled out a short-handled shovel that had been hidden there. Matthew watched as Rawlings fell to digging at rhythm with his companions. "What of the witch?" he asked Winston as he worked. "When's she gonna hang?" </p><p> "Not hang. She'll be burned at the stake. I expect it shall be within the next few days." </p><p> "You'll be cooked too then, won't you? You and Danforth both!" </p><p> "Just concern yourself with your digging," Winston said tersely. "You needn't put them deep, but make sure they're well covered." </p><p> "All right! Work on, my lads! We don't want to tarry long in this Satan's country, do we?" </p><p> Winston grunted. "Here or there, it's <i>all</i> Satan's country, isn't it?" He gave the left side of his neck a sound slap, executing some bloodsucking beastie. </p><p> It took only a few moments for a hole to be opened, six buckets secreted within it, and the sand shovelled over them. Rawlings was a master at appearing to work hard, with all the necessary facial contortions and exertions of breath, but his shovel might have been a spoon, for all the sand it moved. When the buckets were laid under, Rawlings stepped back, wiped his brow with his forearm, and said, "Well done, well done!" as if he were congratulating himself. He returned the implement to its hiding place amid the palmettos and grinned broadly at Winston, who stood nearby watching in silence. "I expect this'll be the last trip, then!" </p><p> "I think we should continue one more month," Winston said. </p><p> Rawlings's grin collapsed. "What need will you have of any more, if she's to be burned?" </p><p> "I'll make a need. Tell Mr. Danforth I shall be here at the hour." </p><p> "As you please, your majesty!" Rawlings gave Winston an exaggerated comical bow and the two other men laughed. "Any other communications to the realm?" </p><p> "Our business is concluded." Winston said coldly. He picked up by its wire handle the seventh bucket that had been laid aside, and then he abruptly turned toward Matthew -- who instantly ducked down and pressed himself against the earth -- and began to walk through the grass. </p><p> "I've never seen a burnin' before!" Rawlings called after him. "Make sure you take it all in, so's you can describe it to me!" Winston didn't respond, but kept on walking. His course, Matthew was relieved to see, took him along a diagonal line perhaps ten or twelve feet to Matthew's west. Then Winston had gone past, holding the lantern low under his cloak to shed some light on where he was stepping. Matthew presumed he would extinguish the candle long before he got within view of the watchman's tower. </p><p> "That tight-assed prig! I could lay him out with my little finger!" Rawlings boasted to his companions after Winston had departed. </p><p> "You could lay him out with your bloody <i>breath!"</i> one of the others said, and the third man guffawed. </p><p> "Right you are, at that! Come on, let's cast off this damned shingle! Thank Christ we've got a fair wind for a change tonight!" </p><p> Matthew lifted his head and watched as the men returned to their oarboat. They pushed it off the beach, Rawlings clambered over the side first and then the other men, the oars were taken up -- though not by the big chief -- and the vessel moved out through the lathery surf. It was quickly taken by the darkness. </p><p> Matthew knew that if he waited long enough and kept a sharp enough eye he might see some evidence of a larger craft at anchor out there -- possibly the flare of a match lighting a pipe, or a stain of mooncolor on a billowing sail. He did not, however, have the time or the inclination. Suffice it to know that an oarboat was not a vessel suitable for a sea voyage. </p><p> He looked in the direction Winston had gone, back toward Fount Royal. Satisfied that he was alone, Matthew got up from his defensive posture and immediately went on the offensive. He found the disturbed area beside the palmettos where the buckets had been buried, and -- two painful palmetto-spike stabs later -- gripped his hand on the concealed shovel. </p><p> As Winston had specified, the buckets were not buried very deeply. All Matthew desired was one. The bucket he chose was of common construction, its lid sealed with a coating of dried tar, and of weight Matthew estimated between seven and eight pounds. He used the shovel again to fill the cavity, then returned it to the palmettos and set off for Fount Royal with the bucket in his possession. </p><p> The way back was no less difficult than his previous journey. It came to him that he was most likely locked out of Bidwell's mansion and would have to ring the bell to gain entrance; did he wish to let anyone in the household see him with this bucket in hand? Whatever game Winston was up to, Matthew didn't want to tip the man that his table had been overturned. He trusted Mrs. Nettles to a point, but in his opinion the jury was still out on everyone in the damned town. So: what to do with the bucket? </p><p> He had an idea, but it would mean trusting one person implicitly. Two persons, if Goode's wife should be counted. He was eager to learn the bucket's contents, and most likely Goode would have an implement to force it open. </p><p> With a great degree of thankfulness Matthew put the swamp at his back, negotiated the pinewoods to avoid the watchtower, and shortly thereafter stood before John Goode's door. Upon it he rapped as quietly as he thought possible, though the sound to his ears was alarmingly loud and must have awakened every slave in the quarters. To his chagrin, he had to knock a second time -- and harder -- before a light blotched the window's covering of stretched oilskin cloth. </p><p> The door opened. A candle was pushed out, and above it was Goode's sleepy-eyed face. He'd been prepared to be less than courteous to whoever had come knocking at such an hour, but when he saw first the white skin and then who wore it he put himself together. "Oh...yes suh?" </p><p> "I have something that needs looking at." Matthew held up the bucket. "May I enter?" </p><p> Of course he was not to be denied. "What is it?" May asked from their pallet of a bed as Goode brought Matthew in and closed the door. "Nothin' that concerns you, woman," he said as he lit a second candle from the first. "Go back to sleep, now." She rolled over, pulling a threadbare covering up to her neck. </p><p> Goode put the two candles on the table and Matthew set the bucket down between them. "I followed a certain gentleman out to the swamp just a while ago," Matthew explained. "I won't go into the particulars, but he has more of these buried out there. I want to see what's in it." </p><p> Goode ran his fingers around the tar-sealed lid. He picked up the bucket and turned it so its bottom was in the light. There, burnt by a brand into the wood, was the letter K and beneath that the letters <i>CT.</i> "Maker's mark," he said. "From a cooper in Charles Town, 'pears to be." He looked around for a tool and put his hand on a stout knife. Then he began chipping the tar away as Matthew watched in eager anticipation. When enough of the seal had been broken, Goode slid the blade under the lid and worked it up. In another moment the lid came loose, and Goode lifted it off. </p><p> Before sight was made of what the bucket concealed, smell gave its testimony. "Whoo!" Goode said, wrinkling his nose. Matthew put the sharp odor as being of a brimstone quality, with ...</p></p><h2>Think a Second Time</h2><p>What are the two great lies of the 20th century? <p> Is there a solution to evil? </p><p> What matters more, blood or love? </p><p> Can a good man go to a striptease show? </p><p> Do you think you have the answers? ...Think a second time. </p><p> Dennis Prager, theologian and philosopher turned talk-show host, is one of the most brilliant and compelling voices in America today.

Salivated at the sight (or thought) of a sour lemon? Felt turned on just from hearing your partner's voice? If so, then you've experienced how dramatically the workings of your mind can affect your body. <br><br>Yet while we accept that stress or anxiety can damage our health, the idea of "healing thoughts" was long ago hijacked by New Age gurus and spiritual healers. Recently, however, serious scientists from a range of fields have been uncovering evidence that our thoughts, emotions and beliefs can ease pain, heal wounds, fend off infection and heart disease and even slow the progression of AIDS and some cancers.<br><br>In <i>Cure</i>, award-winning science writer Jo Marchant travels the world to meet the physicians, patients and researchers on the cutting edge of this new world of medicine. We learn how meditation protects against depression and dementia, how social connections increase life expectancy and how patients who feel cared for recover from surgery faster. We meet Iraq war veterans who are using a virtual arctic world to treat their burns and children whose ADHD is kept under control with half the normal dose of medication. We watch as a transplant patient uses the smell of lavender to calm his hostile immune system and an Olympic runner shaves vital seconds off his time through mind-power alone. <br><br>Drawing on the very latest research, Marchant explores the vast potential of the mind's ability to heal, lays out its limitations and explains how we can make use of the findings in our own lives.

Her living space is tidy but densely packed with framed photos, scented candles and an overwhelming preference for the color green. She sits me at the table, in front of a perfectly laid out tea set and a plate of ten macaroons. The 67-year-old is plump with short, auburn hair and a girlish giggle. &#x201c;Everyone thinks it&#x2019;s dyed, but it isn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; she tells me. She hovers until I try a macaroon, then sits down opposite and tells me about her struggles with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).<br><br>She talks fast. Her symptoms first struck two decades ago, when her marriage of 23 years broke down. Although she dreamed of being a hair- dresser, she was working shifts in a factory, running machinery that made surgical blades, juggling the 60-hour week with a court battle and caring for the two youngest of her four children. &#x201c;I went through&nbsp; hell,&#x201d; she says. Within a year of the split, she started suffering from intestinal pains, cramps, diarrhea and bloating.<br><br>The condition has affected her ever since, especially at stressful times such as when she was laid off from the factory. Their jobs outsourced to Mexico, the group of women with whom she had worked and bonded was scattered. She retrained as a medical assistant, hoping to find work in a<br> chiropractor&#x2019;s office, but once she qualified she found that no one was&nbsp;hiring. When she did finally find a part-time job, she had to give it up because of the pain from her IBS. <br><br>The condition has destroyed her social life too. When the symptoms are bad, &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t even leave the house,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d be keeling over in pain, running to the bathroom all the time.&#x201d; Even buying groceries re- quires staying within reach of a bathroom, and she lists the local facilities: one in the Market Basket, one in the post office down the street. &#x201c;This is&nbsp;20 years I&#x2019;ve been doing this,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a horrible way to live.&#x201d; Now she has to juggle the condition with looking after her elderly parents&#x2014; her mother lives alone, while her father, who suffers from dementia, is in a nursing home. Linda&#x2019;s brother was killed in Vietnam, and her twin sister died of cancer 18 years ago, so she is the only one left to help them.<br><br>She brightens. &#x201c;But I travel,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;I go to England, I do every- thing. I love it.&#x201d; I&#x2019;m thrown by this statement until I realize that she&#x2019;s talking about Google maps. I ask her to show me, and we move over to her computer, which sits on a desk squeezed between the sofa and the micro- wave. She fires up the maps program and lands us on top of Buckingham Palace in London.<br><br>Suddenly I get a sense of how much time Linda has spent in this flat. She knows the layout of the palace intimately, zooming in to try to peek through the windows, then flying around the back to check out the private gardens. Other favorite destinations include the Caribbean island of Aruba, and the celebrity mansions of Rodeo Drive. Sometimes she looks up the addresses of her old workmates from the factory, friends who when they lost their jobs moved away to Kentucky or California, places that because of her IBS, and the demands of her parents, she can never visit for real.<br><br>Over the years, Linda has, like many patients with irritable bowel syn- drome, been passed from doctor to doctor. She has been tested for intol- erances and allergies, and has tried cutting out everything from gluten and fat to tomatoes. But she found no relief until she took part in a trial led by Ted Kaptchuk, a professor at Harvard Medical School in Boston. It was a trial that would revolutionize the world of placebo research.<br> &nbsp;<br> � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; � &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; � <br>&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You know I&#x2019;m deviant?&#x201d; Ted Kaptchuk looks straight at me and I get the sense that he is rather proud of this fact.1 &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I answer. It&#x2019;s hard to read anything about the Harvard professor without coming across his unusual past. In fact it seeps from every corner of our surroundings&#x2014;the house where he lives and works, on a leafy side street in Cambridge, Mas- sachusetts.<br><br>I&#x2019;m asked to remove my shoes as I enter, and offered a cup of Earl Grey tea. Persian rugs cover the wooden floors, and proudly displayed in the hall is a huge brass tea urn. The d�cor is elegant, featuring period furniture, modern art and shelves filled with books&#x2014;rows of hardbound doorstops embossed with gold Chinese lettering next to English volumes, from <i>The Jewish Wardrobe </i>to <i>Honey Hunters of Nepal</i>. Through the win- dow I glimpse the nuanced greens and pinks of a manicured ornamental garden that might be more at home in Japan.<br><br>Kaptchuk himself has gold rings, big brown eyes and a sweep of gray- ing hair topped by a black skullcap. He likes to quote from historical man- uscripts, and his answers to my questions are accompanied by long pauses and a furrowed brow. I ask him to tell me his own version of the path that brought him here and he says it started when he was a student and he traveled to Asia to study traditional Chinese medicine.<br><br>It&#x2019;s a decision he attributes to &#x201c;sixties craziness. I wanted to do some- thing anti-imperialist.&#x201d; He was also interested in Eastern religions and phi- losophies, and the thinking of the Chinese Communist leader Mao Zedong. &#x201c;Now I think that was a really bad reason to study Chinese medicine. But I didn&#x2019;t wanted to be co-opted, I didn&#x2019;t want to be part of the system.&#x201d;<br><br>After four years in Taiwan and China, he returned to the U.S. with a degree in Chinese medicine and opened a small acupuncture clinic in Cambridge. He saw patients with all sorts of conditions, mostly chronic complaints from pain to digestive, urinary and respiratory problems. Over the years, however, he became more and more uncomfortable with his role as a healer. He was good at what he did&#x2014;perhaps too good. He would see dramatic cures, sometimes before patients had even received their treatment. &#x201c;I would have patients who left my office totally differ- ent,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Because they sat and talked to me, and I wrote a prescrip- tion. I was petrified that I was psychic. I thought, Shit, this is crazy.&#x201d; <br><br> Ultimately, Kaptchuk concluded that he didn&#x2019;t have paranormal pow- ers. But equally, he believed that his patients&#x2019; striking recoveries didn&#x2019;t have anything to do with the needles or the herbs he was prescribing. They were because of something else, and he was interested in finding out what that something was.<br><br>In 1998, Harvard Medical School, just down the street from Kaptchuk&#x2019;s clinic, was looking for an expert in Chinese medicine. The U.S. &nbsp;National Institutes &nbsp;of Health (NIH) &nbsp;was opening a center dedi- cated to funding scientific research into alternative and complementary medicine. Although tiny compared to existing NIH centers investigating cancer, for example, or genetics, it promised to be a useful new source of research dollars for Harvard. &#x201c;But no one there knew a thing about Chinese medicine or any kind of alternative medicine,&#x201d; says Kaptchuk. &#x201c;So they hired me.&#x201d;<br><br>Rather than study Chinese medicine directly, however, he decided to investigate the placebo effect, to find out whether this could explain why his patients did so well. Whereas Benedetti is interested in the molecules and mechanics of the placebo effect, Kaptchuk&#x2019;s focus is on people. The questions he asks are psychological and philosophical. Why should the expectation of a cure affect us so profoundly? Can the placebo effect be split into different components? Is our response affected by factors such as the type of placebo we take, or the bedside manner of our doctor?<br><br>In one of his first trials, Kaptchuk compared the effectiveness of two different kinds of placebo&#x2014;fake acupuncture and a fake pill&#x2014;in 270 pa- tients with persistent arm pain.2 &nbsp;It&#x2019;s a study that makes no sense from a conventional perspective. When comparing two inert treatments&#x2014; nothing with nothing&#x2014;you wouldn&#x2019;t expect to see any difference. Yet Kaptchuk did see a difference. Placebo acupuncture was more effective for reducing the patients&#x2019; pain, whereas the placebo pill worked better for helping them to sleep.<br><br>This is the problem with placebo effects&#x2014;in trials they are elusive and ephemeral, rarely disappearing completely but often altering their shape. They change depending on the type of placebo, and they vary in strength between people, conditions and cultures. For example, the percentage of people who responded to placebo in trials of a particular ulcer medication&nbsp;ranged from 59% in Denmark to just 7% in Brazil.3 The same placebo can have positive, zero or negative effects depending on what we&#x2019;re told about it, and the effects can change over time. Such shifting results have helped to create an aura around the placebo effect as something slightly unscientific if not downright crazy. <br><br>But it isn&#x2019;t crazy. What these results actually show, says Kaptchuk, is that scientists have long gotten their understanding of the placebo effect backwards. When he arrived at Harvard, he says, the experts there told him that the placebo effect &#x201c;was the effect of an inert substance.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s a commonly used description but one that Kaptchuk describes as &#x201c;com- plete nonsense.&#x201d; By definition, he points out, an inert substance does not have any effect.<br><br>What does have an effect, of course, is our psychological response to those inert substances. Neither fake acupuncture nor a fake pill is in itself capable of doing anything. But patients interpret them in different ways, and that in turn creates different changes in their symptoms.</p><h2>Turner&#39;s Apprentice: A Watercolor Masterclass</h2><p><p><strong>A unique, practical manual that enables readers to become an apprentice to one of the world&#x2019;s greatest painters.</strong></p><p>How can a modern painter go about learning the techniques and methods of a long-dead master?

Compiled and edited by Edmund Wilson shortly after F. Scott Fitzgerald's death, this revealing collection of his essays&#x2015;as well as letters to and from Gertrude Stein, Edith Wharton, T.S. Eliot, John Dos Passos&#x2015;tells of a man with charm and talent to burn, whose gaiety and genius made him a living symbol of the Jazz Age, and whose recklessness brought him grief and loss. "Fitzgerald's physical and spiritual exhaustion is described brilliantly," noted <em>The New York Review of Books</em>: "the essays are amazing for the candor."</p><p>F. Scott Fitzgerald (1896&#x2013;1941) was one of the literary titans of the 20th century. A member of the &#x201c;Lost Generation&#x201d; of the 1920s, Fitzgerald&#x2019;s writings best captured what he termed &#x201c;The Jazz Age,&#x201d; a period of declining traditional American values, prohibition and speakeasies, and great leaps in modernist trends.</p><h2>Leading Anti-Bias Early Childhood Programs: A Guide for Change (Early Childhood Education)</h2><p><p>With a focus on the leader&#x2019;s role in initiating and sustaining anti-bias education in programs for young children and their families, this book is both a stand-alone text and a perfect companion for <em>Anti-Bias Education for Young Children and Ourselves</em>.

To find them in the sky, it is best to start with Orion, one of the most conspicuous constellations. The stars of Orion vividly suggest the mythological figure they are supposed to represent -- a bold hunter armed with a club and sword and faced by a charging bull. To observe Orion, find a place where you have a clear view of the sky. Turn so that you are facing south. During the evening hours this month you will find Orion about halfway up from the horizon to the zenith. The zenith is the point in the sky directly above your head. The most striking feature of the constellation is the alignment of three equally bright stars in the hunter's belt. If you are looking in the fight direction you can't miss it. As you stand facing giant Orion, the glittering yellow star almost directly over your head is Capella in the constellation Auriga the Charioteer. Capella, with Aldebaran in Taurus the Bull, Rigel in Orion, Sirius and Procyon in the Big and Little Dogs, and the Gemini twins Castor and Pollux, make up the <i>Winter Hexagon.</i> Betelgeuse, the brilliant red star in the arm of Orion, is near the center of the Hexagon. In January and February we will look closely at each of these stars and constellations in turn.<br><br><b>JANUARY 2<br><br>2nd:</b> Once you have found and learned the stars of Orion's belt, you will never again have trouble recognizing this constellation. Look also for the bright stars of the shoulders and feet and the fainter stars of the head and sword. Orion rises in the early evening at the beginning of December and dominates the sky all winter long. The hunter's stars, which include two of the brightest in the heavens, outshine those of any other constellation. Because Orion stands above the earth's equator, it is visible from every inhabited place on earth. All human cultures in every time and place have given special note in story and myth to this wonderful array of stars. Sailors of old feared the sight of Orion, for his appearance on the eastern horizon forecast stormy winter weather. But the hunter has also long been associated in myth with the forces of goodness and light, and as such we welcome his appearance as a promise of sparkling starry nights to come.<br><br><b>JANUARY 3<br><br>3rd:</b> It is important to acquire early a sense of your own place under the stars. Orion's belt will help. Point to the place on your horizon that is due east of your observing location (a map of your town will help you find the approximate compass points -- later you will use the stars). Now swing your arm up in an arc through the stars of Orion's belt, and on to the point on your horizon that is due west. You have traced out the sky's equator, or celestial equator. The <b>celestial equator</b> is the imaginary line among the stars that lies directly above the equator of the earth.<br><br><b>JANUARY 4<br><br>4th:</b> It is convenient to imagine, as the ancients believed, that all of the stars lie on one great skysphere that surrounds and encloses the earth. We call this imaginary sphere the <b>celestial sphere.</b> In fact, as we know, the stars are distributed in space at different distances from earth, and there is no "sky-sphere." The three stars of Orion's belt, however, do lie at about the same distance from the earth and are therefore part of a true cluster. Like many of the stars, the stars of the belt have Arabic names. These names derive from the time of Europe's "Dark Ages" when the Arabs were the keepers and developers of ancient Greek astronomy. When Europeans rediscovered astronomy during the late Middle Ages, it was often by way of Arabic translations of the Greek texts. Mintaka <i>(MIN-tack-a)</i> means "belt." Alnitak <i>(Al-NYE-tack)</i> also means "the belt." The meaning of Alnilam <i>(Al-NILE-am)</i> is less dear but is possibly "the belt of pearls," a beautiful name for this string of dazzling stars. As we go along, you may begin to wonder why so many star names begin with "Al-." The answer is a simple one. "Al-" is the Arabic prefix which means "the."<br><br><b>JANUARY 5<br><br>5th:</b> We require a convenient way to describe the positions of the stars on the <b>celestial sphere.</b> This is accomplished through the use of an <i>angular method of measurement,</i> with the vertex of the measured angle at the eye of the observer. The full circle of the sky, all the way around the earth, is 360 degrees (360�). The angle from horizon to horizon passing over your head is 180�, and the angle from the horizon to the zenith is 90�. If you stretch your arm out in front of you and sight along it with one eye, the angle between the tips of your spread fingers is about 15�. This is the width of the constellation Orion. It should take about six handspans to measure the distance from the horizon to the zenith. Try it and see how closely your hand and arm fit the rule.<br><br><b>JANUARY 6<br><br>6th:</b> Our custom of dividing a circle into 360� derives from ancient Babylonian astronomy. As seen from the earth, the sun appears to make a full circuit of the sky in a little over 365 days (see Jan. 8). A degree, then, as defined by the Babylonians, was about the distance the sun moved each day with respect to the background of stars. The three little stars of Orion's head occupy a circle of about 1� diameter. The angular size of the moon against the sky is 1/2�, or about half the width of your little finger held at arm's length. The moon would therefore fit nicely between the three stars of Orion's head. If you look for these stars on a clear night you might have the impression that the moon is much larger than the space they enclose. Hold out your little finger against these stars and then against the moon, and you will discover that the moon is smaller than you think. Some other useful guides for measuring angles in the sky are shown at the right.<br><br><b>JANUARY 7<br><br>7th:</b> The earth turns on its axis under the stars once every 24 hours, and carries us around as it goes. The stars remain fixed in the deeps of space. The earth turns west to east on its axis. As a result, the stars -- with sun, moon, and planets -- <i>seem</i> to move from east to west, making one full circuit around the earth each day. Like the sun and moon, the stars of Orion rise in the east and set in the west about 12 hours later. If you watch Orion throughout the evening, you will see him move one handspan (15�) toward the west each hour. In 24 hours, Orion will set in the west, pass beneath the earth, and rise again from the east to regain his present position. The illusion that it is the stars, not us, which move is very powerful. The earth is near at hand and seems massive and stationary compared to the apparently tiny celestial objects. Only since the brilliant theoretical work of Nicholas Copernicus in the 16th century have we come to recognize that the "turning" of the stars is actually the turning of the earth.<br><br><b>JANUARY 8<br><br>8th:</b> In addition to a daily spin on its axis, the earth makes a great annual journey around the sun. Since the stars we see at night are those on the side of the earth opposite the sun, the evening sky changes as our vantage point changes. As the earth carries the observer eastward around the sun, the stars seem to move night by night toward the west at a rate of about 1� per day. In 6 months' time, looking out into space from the other side of the sun, we shall find other stars in our starry night.<br><br><b>JANUARY 9<br><br>9th:</b> The stars do not appear equally bright in the sky. This is due to two things: (1) the stars are at different distances from the earth, and (2) the stars are not all of the same intrinsic brightness. The scale that is used to describe the brightness of stars as they appear to earth observers is called the scale of <b>apparent magnitude.</b> The scale was invented by the astronomer Hipparchus who lived and worked in the city of Alexandria 2100 years ago. The brightest stars in the sky, like Rigel and Betelgeuse in Orion, Hipparchus called stars of the <i>first magnitude.</i> The faintest stars he could see, he called <i>sixth-magnitude</i> stars. To other stars he assigned appropriate magnitudes between these limits. Thousands of years later we still use Hipparchus' scale of apparent brightness, although it has of course been made quantitatively more exact. Hipparchus was one of several great astronomers of the ancient world who was associated with the city of Alexandria.<br><br><b>JANUARY 10<br><br>10th:</b> The exact modem magnitudes of the stars of Orion are shown above. If you live near city lights you will not see stars less bright than about the fourth magnitude, or no more than several hundred stars at any one time. If you live where the sky is very dark, on a clear night you might see several thousand stars down to the sixth magnitude. The stars of Orion's head are about the fourth magnitude and are a good test of the quality of the night. Of course, with binoculars or a telescope, you can see many more stars than could be seen by Hipparchus, even on dark Alexandrian nights unmarred by atmospheric pollution or electric lights. With the invention of the telescope it was necessary to extend the scale of apparent magnitude to encompass stars less bright than the sixth magnitude (see Oct. 25-28). At the other end of the scale, a few stars in the sky -- Sirius, Canopus, Alpha Centauri, and Arctutus -- have been assigned negative magnitudes on the modem scale.<br><br><b>JANUARY 11<br><br>11th:</b> Just below the star Alnitak in Orion's belt is one of the most famous objects in the sky. <i>The Horsehead Nebula</i> is a dark cloud of dust and gas silhouetted against a brighter region of glowing interstellar gas heated to incandescence by the energy of the many stars embedded within it. The Horsehead takes its name from its shape. The size of this dark cloud is almost too great to imagine. A billion solar systems would fit neatly inside, and the Horsehead is just a wisp of a much larger cloud! You will not see the Horsehead with the naked eye. It is best seen with long-exposure telescopic photographs.<br><br><b>JANUARY 12<br><br>12th:</b> The vast spaces between the stars are filled with dust and gas. It is in just such dense nebulae as the Horsehead that astronomers believe stars and possibly planets are born, condensing by gravity from the material of the cloud. If a knot of condensing gas -- it is mostly hydrogen -- is compressed to a density and temperature great enough for nuclear fusion to occur (see Jan. 14), a star is born. This is the process that is occurring even now in the <i>Great Orion Nebula.</i> What looks to the naked eye like three stars in Orion's sword are revealed by a small telescope to be a fascinating complex of stars and glowing gas clouds. Even to the unaided eye the central "star" of the sword may seem fuzzy. This "star" is the Great Nebula, a spectacular region of turbulent gas and dust heated by the radiation of hot young stars that have only recently (by star time!) condensed from the matter of the cloud. The diameter of the Great Nebula is more than 20,000 times that of the solar system, and there is enough hydrogen, helium, and other materials in the cloud to form at least 10,000 stars similar to our sun. Stars have lifetimes such as we do, although much longer ones. In the Great Orion Nebula we observe their births; shortly we will see how they die.<br><br><b>JANUARY 13<br><br>13th:</b> Embedded in the very heart of the Great Orion Nebula, and visible with binoculars or a small telescope, is the beautiful multiple star system known as the <i>Trapezium,</i> four hot young stars in a tight trapezoid-shaped cluster. Actually, these four stars are only the brighter components of an expanding cluster containing hundreds of faint stars. The intense radiation from these high-temperature stars excites the gas of the surrounding nebula and makes it glow. To the eye the nebula glows with an eerie green light, but photographs show beautiful hues of pink, blue, and violet.<br><br><b>JANUARY 14<br><br>14th:</b> From the expansion rate of the Trapezium cluster and from the color and brightness characteristics of the member stars (see Mar. 19-20), it has been estimated that the stars in the group may be less than half a million years old -- making it one of the youngest associations of stars known. Indeed, some members of the group may even now be "turning on" their nuclear energy sources to become stars. As gravity pulls together a knot of gas and dust from the Great Nebula, the pressure and temperature at the core of the contracting cloud go up. When the temperature reaches about 10 million degrees Celsius, nuclei of hydrogen atoms fuse together to form the heavier nuclei of helium. This is the same process that occurs in the explosion of a hydrogen bomb and results in a release of energy. The energy makes its way to the surface of the contracting sphere where it is radiated as heat and light. A star is born! The new energy source at the star's core stops the gravitational contraction of the star. The star can continue to burn steadily -- an outward pressure sustained by nuclear fusion balanced against gravity -- for as long as the hydrogen at the core holds out. The lifetime of a hot blue star such as Bellatrix might be as little as 10 million years. Bellatrix is larger than the sun and contains 10 times as much matter. Although it has more fuel than the sun, Bellatrix is a hotter star and "bums" its hydrogen at a faster rate. The slower-burning sun will probably have a lifetime of 10 or 15 billion years. Since our star is now about 5 billion years old, we have about at least 5 billion years to go!<br><br><b>JANUARY 15<br><br>15th:</b> When a star such as Bellatrix has used up the hydrogen fuel at its core, gravity again gets the upper hand and the core of the star collapses. The sudden increase in pressure and temperature in the core releases new (but limited) sources of nuclear energy which heat the outer layers of the star and cause them to expand outward. As the star swells, the outer layers cool and change color from bluish, to white, to yellow, to red. The massive white star Rigel <i>(RYE-jell,</i> "foot") is possibly at this stage of its evolution and has begun the process of expansion. Rigel is 50 times bigger than the sun.<br><br><b>JANUARY 16<br><br>16th:</b> If Rigel continues to expand, in tens of thousands of years it will become a <b>red giant</b> star like Betelgeuse <i>(BET-el-jews,</i> or <i>beetle juice</i> is close enough, "armpit of the giant"). Betelgeuse is one of the largest stars known. Its diameter is greater than the earth's orbit around the sun! It is one of the very few giant stars that has been seen as an actual disk, rather than a mere point of light. Using special techniques, astronomers have taken photographs that show features of its surface. The distinctive reddish, color of Betelgeuse is readily apparent to the eye, particularly by contrast with white Rigel.<br><br><b>JANUARY 17<br><br>17th:</b> As he stands in the winter sky with his club raised, Orion faces a formidable opponent. Plunging toward him from the west is Taurus (TOR-<i>us)</i> the Bull, an awesome long-homed creature with threatening red eye and head lowered in a tumultuous charge. The bull is not so conspicuous a constellation as bright Orion, but the "vee" of stars that outlines the bull's face is easily recognized. Taurus is almost certainly one of the most ancient of the constellations. It is one of the familiar <b>signs of the zodiac,</b> the constellations that the sun moves through during its yearly journey across the sky (see June 25).

Dodging a horse and carriage, he jumped over a puddle then ran toward a brick building that took up half the city block. He shrugged out of his overcoat, hung it on a hook just inside the door then quietly entered a large workroom filled with a half-dozen young men sitting at their desks, their attention focused on the office at the far side of the room. No one noticed that Reginald was late, and he took his seat, glancing toward the open door, where Charles Rolls and Henry Royce, both dressed in dark suits, were talking to a policeman. <br> &#x201c;That looks ominous,&#x201d; Reginald said, glancing over at his cousin, Jonathon Payton, who sat at the desk next to his. &#x201c;What did I miss?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s gone.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;What&#x2019;s gone?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;The forty-fifty prototype.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;When?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Last night. They went there this morning to finish up the coachwork and it was gone.&#x201d;<br> Reginald leaned back in his chair as he looked around the room, then focused on the men in the office, imagining what this would do to the company. Rolls-Royce had put all their money and that of their investors into this improved six-cylinder engine. Every last penny had gone into the design of that, as well as a chassis meant to withstand the harsh country roads. When the world seemed to laugh at them, saying it couldn&#x2019;t be done, they&#x2019;d persevered. And now, when they were on the verge of accomplishing the impossible....<br> Jonathon leaned toward him, lowering his voice. &#x201c;Was Elizabeth pleased?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Pleased?&#x201d; he said, unable to draw his gaze from the office. Reginald&#x2019;s wife, Elizabeth, had taken their newborn son to visit her mother, and for the life of him, he couldn&#x2019;t figure out why Jonathon would bring her up at a time like this. &#x201c;About what?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;About the pianoforte.&#x201d;<br> A shame he couldn&#x2019;t hear what they were discussing in there, and he finally turned toward his cousin, belatedly recalling last night&#x2019;s conversation when he&#x2019;d solicited Jonathon&#x2019;s assistance. &#x201c;Undoubtedly, she will be. Meant to thank you for helping my friends and me move it, but you&#x2019;d disappeared. One minute you were next to me, the next you were gone.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I guess I had a bit much. Not sure what happened.&#x201d; He was quiet a moment, then whispered, &#x201c;You won&#x2019;t mention that to my father, will you?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Of course not.&#x201d; Jonathon&#x2019;s father, Viscount Wellswick, had raised both boys after Reginald&#x2019;s parents died, though Reginald always suspected he&#x2019;d have ended up in an orphanage if not for the intervention of Jonathon&#x2019;s mother.&nbsp; Ironic, considering that she was the reason their fathers had been the bitterest of enemies.&nbsp; Reginald&#x2019;s father had been in love with her, but her fortune was needed to restore the viscountcy, so she was wedded to Jonathon&#x2019;s father instead. He often wondered if she regretted the marriage. Her husband, the viscount, was frugal beyond belief, as well as a strict disciplinarian. He certainly wouldn&#x2019;t have approved of either of them spending a night at one of the local taverns, drinking ale with the neighborhood residents. The viscount was all about propriety. How it would look to his friends if his son and nephew stepped out of line. Appearances were everything, which was why Reginald and Jonathon were expected to oversee the running of the orphanage that bore the viscount&#x2019;s name. Jonathon, in line to be the next viscount and heir to the Payton estate, was expected to be there six days a week, usually stopping in after work. In Reginald&#x2019;s mind, that was the one advantage of being the poor relation living under his uncle&#x2019;s roof. He was only expected to volunteer his time at the orphanage twice a week. Of course, that was in addition to the six days a week both men spent working for Rolls-Royce. <br> There were no free rides in the Payton home, the old man thinking that working at a job each day built character. Had the viscount discovered Reginald had led Payton astray, he&#x2019;d likely toss Reginald, his wife and son out to the streets. &#x201c;Not to worry,&#x201d; Reginald said, turning his attention back to the office. &#x201c;Your secret of drunken debauchery is safe with me.&#x201d; <br> Reginald watched the men talking in the office, the faces of the two owners, Rolls and Royce, looking drawn, the loss weighing on them. The stolen car, named the Grey Ghost for the color of the body and the quietness of the forty-fifty engine, had been kept a secret from all but their investors, for fear that someone might try to steal their ideas. Apparently, it had never occurred to them that someone might steal the entire car. Payton&#x2019;s father, the viscount, had offered the family warehouse to store the car while they were fitting it with its custom coachwork, hoping to enter it into the Olympia car show in just a few months. Reginald and Jonathon had discussed the idea that the vehicle would be more secure there, less likely to fall prey to anyone skulking around the factory, stealing plans. Jonathon, however, was the one who&#x2019;d presented it. &#x201c;Tough break this happening on your watch, don&#x2019;t you think?&#x201d; Reginald said.<br> &#x201c;Quite. I expect they&#x2019;ll sack me for it.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Have they said anything to you?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;No,&#x201d; Payton whispered, his face paling as Mr. Rolls shook the officer&#x2019;s hand then escorted him out the door. <br> Mr. Royce stepped out after them then looked right at Jonathon. &#x201c;Do you have a moment?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Right away, sir.&#x201d; Jonathon Payton rose, not looking at his cousin as he walked toward the office.<br> &#x201c;Close the door.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d; He shut the door behind him. <br> Reginald eyed the journals on a cabinet against the wall near the office, casually walking over, picking up the topmost one, pretending to read it. The walls were thin enough to hear what was being said.<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve no doubt heard what happened?&#x201d; Mr. Royce asked Jonathon.<br> &#x201c;I have.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;You realize what dire straits we&#x2019;re in?&#x201d;<br> Reginald leaned in closer. In charge of the books, he knew every penny the company spent and what would happen to their investors if they didn&#x2019;t recover that car and start turning a profit. They&#x2019;d go bankrupt, his uncle, the viscount&#x2014;who&#x2019;d invested everything&#x2014;right along with them. Jonathon&#x2019;s response, though, was covered by the return of Mr. Rolls, who nearly ran into Reginald as he came back from seeing the officer out. <br> &#x201c;Pardon,&#x201d; Mr. Rolls said, stepping past him. He started to open the door, then paused, looking over at Reginald, and then the other young men sitting at their desks, their attention on what was happening in the office. &#x201c;I daresay we&#x2019;re all frightfully worried over this setback. But we&#x2019;ll get past it. In the meantime, let&#x2019;s all get back to our tasks, shall we?&#x201d;<br> The young men nodded, as did Reginald, and their employer gave a worried smile then entered the office. &#x201c;This is disastrous,&#x201d; he said, pushing the door closed. It didn&#x2019;t latch tight. &#x201c;We have to find that engine.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Why would anyone bother?&#x201d; Mr. Royce asked. &#x201c;The blasted coachwork wasn&#x2019;t even finished.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Why do you think?&#x201d; Rolls replied. &#x201c;Sending spies sniffing around, trying to best us. Whoever it was, they stole it because they couldn&#x2019;t build anything close to what we have.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Problem is, it&#x2019;s still in the prototype stage. If they get it out there before we do, we lose it all. Every investor we have will pull out.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Good point. What if we lose the patent?&#x201d; Rolls said. &#x201c;We have to get that car back before the Olympia car show.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;The policeman suggested we hire a detective.&#x201d;<br> Mr. Rolls made a scoffing noise. &#x201c;Not sure we want <i>that</i> to get out to our investors. Can&#x2019;t even keep track of our own products before they find their way into the hands of our competitors.&#x201d; <br> Jonathon Payton started to speak, his voice cracking. He cleared his throat and started again, saying, &#x201c;What about those parts we sent out to be machined? If we could get them back in time, we might have a chance to finish that other forty-fifty.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Brilliant idea,&#x201d; Royce said. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ve got to be ready by now. Give them a ring, Payton. If they&#x2019;re ready, see if they can&#x2019;t get them on the next train. We might just save this company after all.&#x201d;<br> ###<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>One week later...</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> Just before sunrise, ten-year-old Toby Edwards and his nine-year-old brother, Chip, picked their way down the street, avoiding the low spots where the rain flowed down from the previous day&#x2019;s storm. They stopped at the entrance to the alley. &#x201c;Wait here,&#x201d; Toby said, moving his brother into the shadow. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be back soon.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Why can&#x2019;t I go? I&#x2019;ll be quiet as a mouse.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Just wait. If anything happens, run back.&#x201d; <br> The boy nodded and Toby moved off. The last time he&#x2019;d stolen something from the bakery, he&#x2019;d nearly gotten caught after stepping in a deep puddle. The water had soaked through his worn soles, his boots squeaking with every step he took. A customer was the one who&#x2019;d heard, calling out to the baker that a thief had broken in, then chased after him. <br> He wasn&#x2019;t about to make that mistake again. <br> Worried the baker might catch him again, he&#x2019;d stayed away for several days, until hunger drove him out once more. This time, when he reached the back of the shop, he wiggled his toes, grateful that they seemed relatively dry. He glanced back, could just make out his brother in the dark. Satisfied he was waiting as he should, Toby moved in.<br> The waiting was the hardest part. He breathed in the scent of fresh-baked bread drifting into the alley. Every morning, the baker opened the back door a crack, just enough to let his grey tabby in and out. The door was locked tight, and Toby wondered if, after he&#x2019;d nearly been caught, the man had realized it left him ripe for theft. Every minute that slipped by, Toby despaired. About to turn away, he heard the door open. The cat slipped out, its tiny paws silent on the wet cobblestones as it walked toward him, then rubbed its whiskered face against Toby&#x2019;s patched trousers.<br> When the cat meowed loudly, Toby crouched beside it, petting the feline&#x2019;s head, feeling it purr against his fingertips. &#x201c;Hush, you,&#x201d; he whispered, watching the door.<br> Finally, he heard the faint tinkle from the bell that hung on the shop&#x2019;s front door, then the baker&#x2019;s deep voice, greeting whoever it was that had walked in. Usually it was the servants in the big manor houses that ventured out this early, those who didn&#x2019;t bake their own bread.<br> Toby edged over, listening before slipping into the door, immediately enveloped by the heat, wishing he could find a spot beneath the table to spend the night where he wouldn&#x2019;t be seen. To be that warm while he slept...<br> Right now, food was more important. Suddenly he stopped, his heart sinking. The basket the baker had always left on the table with the burned and broken loaves wasn&#x2019;t there. <br> The table was empty.<br> His gaze flew to the door that led to the front of the shop, just able to make out the perfect loaves stacked in baskets on the counter.<br> For a moment, he wondered how hard it would be to race out there, grab one, then keep running.<br> He could never do that. It was one thing to take what was going to be tossed out&#x2014;quite another to brazenly steal something the baker made a living on.<br> Stomach rumbling, he backed from the room, his foot hitting a wooden crate near the door. He froze, grateful when no one came racing into the kitchen. When he turned to leave, he saw what was in the wooden crate. Nearly a dozen rolls, the tops a bit too brown, the bottoms black as coal. <br> Unable to believe his luck, he stuffed several rolls into his pockets, resisting the temptation to take every last one of them.<br> Slipping out the door, he raced down the alley, pausing to grab his brother&#x2019;s arm. The two boys darted around the puddles then out to the street, where massive brick warehouses lined the railroad tracks. Toby and Chip lived in the orphanage on the other side. After a quick glance behind him to make sure no one was following, Toby guided his brother that direction. When they reached the corner, he saw a man astride a black mare, the horse champing at the bit. The horseman, struggling to keep his mount in control, glanced in their direction. <br> Toby grasped Chip&#x2019;s hand, holding tight. Instinct told him to continue past as though that had been their intent the entire time. <br> As soon as they were out of sight, they broke into a run. Up ahead, Toby saw an alcove, and pulled his brother into it, hiding the boy behind him.<br> A few seconds later, he heard the staccato clip of the horse&#x2019;s hooves on the cobblestones. Toby peered out, caught a glimpse of the man, and pressed back against the wall, praying the shadows would hide them. <br> &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s that?&#x201d; Chip asked.<br> &#x201c;Quiet.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m hungry,&#x201d; Chip whispered. &#x201c;And cold.&#x201d;<br> There was a familiarity about the man when he&#x2019;d looked over at Toby. <br> As though he&#x2019;d seen him before.<br> And this was what bothered Toby. Something told him that if he didn&#x2019;t find out who the man was, his brother and sisters wouldn&#x2019;t be safe. <br> After their father, a coal miner, died of black lung, their mother had moved them all to Manchester, working at one of the textile mills. But then she&#x2019;d taken ill and could no longer care for them. They&#x2019;d lived the last year at the Payton Home for Orphans. Had it not been for Toby&#x2019;s trips to the bakery, he and his siblings would have starved. <br> He had to get back to his sisters, but the only way to the orphanage was across the tracks. Seconds ticked by, and the low rumble of an approaching train grew louder. Suddenly the horseman turned and galloped back toward the tracks.<br> &#x201c;Wait here,&#x201d; Toby said, tucking his brother safely in the shadows. <br> ###<br> &nbsp;<br> Three days ago, if someone had told Toby that he&#x2019;d be brave enough to follow a horseman in the dark to see what the man was about, he might have laughed. He was the least brave person he knew. But his mother had made him promise to look after his sisters and brother, and that&#x2019;s exactly what he intended to do.<br> He&#x2019;d gone no more than a few feet when Chip appeared at his side. Toby backtracked, taking his brother&#x2019;s hand. &#x201c;I told you to wait.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to stay by myself.&#x201d;<br> Toby considered taking him, until he remembered that feeling of terror when they&#x2019;d almost been caught stealing from the bakery. &#x201c;Hold these for me,&#x201d; he said, pulling three of the four rolls from his pocket and helping his brother put them in his. When he pulled out the fourth roll, he held it up. &#x201c;If you stay here until I come back for you, I&#x2019;ll let you have the extra one.&#x201d;<br> Chip&#x2019;s eyes went wide as he stared at the burnt bread. But then he shook his head. &#x201c;If I have that, what&#x2019;ll you have?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Ate one in the kitchen before I got out,&#x201d; he said, hoping the rumble of his stomach wouldn&#x2019;t give him away. &#x201c;So hungry, I couldn&#x2019;t wait. But you want that extra one, you have to stay here.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t want Lizzie or Abigail to see you eating it. You think you can do that?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; <br> When Toby gave him the last roll, he gripped it in both hands, holding it up to his nose. <br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t leave here until I come get you,&#x201d; Toby said, gently guiding his brother back to the alcove. As soon as Chip was safely tucked away, Toby started the other direction, ke...</p><h2>The Political Theory of the American Founding: Natural Rights, Public Policy, and the Moral Conditions of Freedom</h2><p>This book provides a complete overview of the American Founders&#39; political theory, covering natural rights, natural law, state of nature, social compact, consent, and the policy implications of these ideas. The book is intended as a response to the current scholarly consensus, which holds that the Founders&#39; political thought is best understood as an amalgam of liberalism, republicanism, and perhaps other traditions. West argues that, on the contrary, the foundational documents overwhelmingly point to natural rights as the lens through which all politics is understood. The book explores in depth how the Founders&#39; supposedly republican policies on citizen character formation do not contradict but instead complement their liberal policies on property and economics. Additionally, the book shows how the Founders&#39; embraced other traditions in their politics, such as common law and Protestantism.</p><p>This book provides a complete overview of the American Founders&#39; political theory, covering natural rights, natural law, state of nature, social compact, consent, and the policy implications of these ideas.

I am so pleased that Rhonda Byrne was able to bring together this life-changing information so masterfully. She first did it for the movie of the same name that she produced, which has been a phenomenon in its own right. She then added, in only ones month's time, incredible additional content to the transcript of the film that brings even more clarity to the reader. This is absolutely a book that people from all walks of life can read and then "get" the concept of The Secret. It allows them to then take it and apply it to their lives. Children, teenagers and adults of all ages are reporting miraculous stories of positive changes as a result. Rhonda Byrne is dedicated to maintaining the integrity of The Secret and to making sure that now, finally, the whole world knows about The Secret.

However, in our global context, Christian ethicists must now, in addition, compare and contrast various ethics. Christian ethics has become increasingly multivocal not only because of a plurality of faiths but also because of a plurality of Christianities. <br> <br> Beginning with five key ideas about God&#x2019;s relationship to humanity and history, Dr. Lovin shows how these work together to shape the Christian stance. In the first three chapters, he then shows how those ideas took shape in relation to other ways of thinking about ethics in the world of early Christianity and identifies four major variations: Synergy, Integrity, Realism, and Liberation. The six remaining chapters cover historical and contemporary developments in the three ways of thinking about moral choices: teleology, deontology, and areteology. Test cases are also included. <br> <br> The purpose of the book is to indicate what is possible in Christian ethics, rather than to prescribe one way that it ought to be done. The aim is not to get readers to choose one among the Christian possibilities and use it exclusively, but use this introduction as a resource to arrive at their own ways of thinking about moral problems in order to act with integrity.</p><p>Dr. Robin W. Lovin (B.A., Northwestern University; B.D., Ph.D. Harvard University) is Cary Maguire University Professor of Ethics at Southern Methodist University. Prof. Lovin served as Dean of the Perkins School of Theology from 1994 until 2002 and previously held teaching positions at Emory University and the University of Chicago, and he was Dean of the Theological School at Drew University. He is an ordained minister of the United Methodist Church and is active in local and national church events. His research interests include social ethics, religion and law, and comparative religious ethics. He has served on the editorial boards of numerous scholarly journals, including the Journal of the American Academy of Religion, Studies in Christian Ethics, and the Journal of Law and Religion, and he is an editor-at-large for the Christian Century.</p><h2>Introduction to Student-Involved Assessment FOR Learning, An</h2><p><p> <b>Helps learners understand how they can improve student achievement by integrating instruction and assessment.&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Learners should understand and be able to do the following assessment tasks upon completing<i>Student-Involved Assessment FOR Learning:&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;(1) establish clear learning targets as the basis for instruction and assessment, (2) select assessment methods that align with those learning targets, (3) select and/or create high-quality assessments that accurately measure student progress to the learning targets, (4) clearly communicate assessment results to learners for both formative and summative purposes, and (5) involve students in the assessment process to develop their capabilities to be self-directed learners.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <b> <p>Note: This is the standalone book <br> </p> </b></p><p><p> <b> <i>From reviews of the text:</i> </b> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;The text clearly lays out assessment design for beginners.

[M]any existing textbooks do not use this terminology (assessment for, of, and as learning) rather [they] rely on more traditional notions of formative and summative assessment. The newer terminology brings with it more contemporary uses and conceptions of assessment that serve a mandate to support learning through integrated assessments. This message is made clear throughout the text. I also appreciate that the textbook draws on traditional teachings in assessment to establish that assessment for learning does not require a whole new set of assessment techniques. . . . [This text] advances an important (new) mission for educational assessment. I hope it is widely adopted, as I believe it has the capacity to reshape teacher candidates&#x2019; conceptions of assessment as a central teaching and learning tool.&#x201d;</p> <p>Christopher DeLuca, <i>University of South Florida</i> </p><p> <b>Jan Chappuis</b>, educator and author, joined Rick Stiggins at the Assessment Training Institute in Portland, Oregon in 2001.

Ms. Bakewell&#x2019;s approach is enticing and unusual: She is not an omniscient author acting as critic, biographer or tour guide. As someone who came back to this material by rereading it later in life, she has made her responses part of the story. . . . [T]he biographies of most people here intersect with either Sartre&#x2019;s or Heidegger&#x2019;s, sometimes both&#x2014;and each man&#x2019;s story requires its own telling, which Ms. Bakewell does fascinatingly.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b><i>The New York Times</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Sarah Bakewell is expertly equipped to tell us the story of existentialism. . . .

This ambitious book bears out Bakewell&#x2019;s declaration that &#x2018;thinking should be generous and have a good appetite,&#x2019; and that for philosophers and the general reader alike, &#x2018;ideas are interesting, but people are vastly more so.&#x2019;&#x201d; &#x2014;<b><i>Publishers Weekly </i>(starred review)</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> &#x201c;With characteristic erudition, accessibility, intellectual seriousness, and good humor, Sarah Bakewell&#x2019;s robust new history of existentialism . . . traces the history of the movement.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b>Jonathon Sturgeon, Literary Editor, <i>Flavorwire</i></b><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;[T]he most engaging work of philosophy I have read. . . .

But in the winter of 1939&#x2013;40, after a tiny band of Finnish mountain troops brought the invading Soviet army to its knees, an amateur skier named Charles Minot &#x201c;Minnie&#x201d; Dole convinced the United States Army to let him recruit an extraordinary assortment of European expatriates, wealthy ski bums, mountaineers, and thrill-seekers and form them into a unique band of Alpine soldiers. These men endured nearly three years of grueling training in the Colorado Rockies and in the process set new standards for both soldiering and mountaineering. The newly forged 10th Mountain Division finally faced combat in the winter of 1945, in Italy&#x2019;s Apennine Mountains, against the seemingly unbreakable German fortifications north of the Gothic Line. There, they planned and executed what is still regarded as the most daring series of nighttime mountain attacks in U.S. military history, taking Mount Belvedere and the sheer, treacherous face of Riva Ridge to smash the linchpin of the German army&#x2019;s lines.<br><br>Drawing on unique cooperation from veterans of the 10th Mountain Division and a vast archive of unpublished letters and documents, <b>The Last Ridge</b> is written with enormous warmth, energy, and honesty.

An associate professor of English and journalism at the University of Delaware, Jenkins lives with his wife and son in Baltimore.CHAPTER ONE<br> SKIERS<br> &nbsp;<br> IN JULY 1942, THIRTY MONTHS before General Hays first cast his eyes on Riva Ridge, a strong-minded Irishman named Denis Nunan boarded a troop train at California&#x2019;s Camp Roberts and headed north to join an experimental training center at Fort Lewis, near Washington&#x2019;s Mount Rainier. Soldiers on the train slept in four Pullman cars and were fed in a baggage car outfitted with a wood-burning field stove bolted to the floor. Nunan had grown up in Short Hills, New Jersey, just outside New York City, and had never before seen the great mountain ranges of the West. As the train clicked north through the mountains and vast forests of the Pacific Northwest&#x2014;past Mount Shasta, past Klamath Falls, and into the Cascades&#x2014;Nunan found himself overcome with delight. The majesty of the landscape so transfixed him that he amended his brimming eagerness to join the fight overseas. He had thought of himself as training to liberate Europe from the Germans, he told a companion. Now, he declared, he was training to protect his own beautiful country.<br> &nbsp;<br> Immediately after Pearl Harbor, Nunan had left a desk job at IBM, and he was already well into his basic training at the infantry replacement center at Camp Roberts. Upon his arrival on the West Coast, Nunan had instantly noticed a dramatic difference in the sense both soldiers and civilians had about the war. San Francisco Bay was full of warships; military planes cruised along the Marin headlands; armed guards were ubiquitous in the city streets. &#x201c;You really know there&#x2019;s a war on out here,&#x201d; he wrote home. &#x201c;Too bad the East isn&#x2019;t as awake as they are here.&#x201d; When he told his military superiors about his business experience, they automatically pushed him to run the base&#x2019;s IBM machines, but Nunan begged off. Although he was thirty-two, much older than the average enlisted man, he was determined to fight on the front lines as a private. War was a grave business, and he was unwilling to take refuge behind the boys with their necks on the line. Indeed, Nunan&#x2019;s relative maturity inoculated him from the unbridled bravado native to the typical nineteen-year-old soldier. Already an adult with an established career, Nunan had no illusions about establishing his manhood on the battlefield. He signed up not with bloodlust or pride but soberly, a citizen offering to risk his own death in a war he considered unambiguously just.<br> &nbsp;<br> Yet Nunan&#x2019;s seriousness of purpose was always leavened by a twinkling sense of irony and playfulness. For months he had been reading about a remarkable collection of world-class skiers and mountaineers being trained as the country&#x2019;s first mountain troops, and though he hardly fit the mold, he knew instantly that he wanted in. The soldiers dressed in winter camouflage, white hoods pulled over faces painted with white grease, their eyes protected from high-altitude snow blindness by glacier goggles. They rappelled over cliffs, marched over glaciers, and learned to ski in military formation. Nunan wanted to join them, even though, by his own admission, the highest he had ever climbed was &#x201c;to the top of a Fifth Avenue bus.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> If nothing else, Nunan figured, the training he would receive as a mountain soldier would serve him well at the front. Mountaineering and combat were alike in that the physical dangers native to each&#x2014;be they avalanches and rockfalls or sniper fire and land mines&#x2014;required learning to live with extreme psychological stress. Training at high altitude, under the tutelage of experienced mountain men, would be a good way to prepare for the terrors of war, wherever his unit was sent. Mountain training also offered a chance to develop capacities that would be useful long after the war ended: superior physical conditioning, high-altitude navigation and rescue skills, intimacy with the great mysteries of the wilderness. All things a young man would be unlikely to learn in an office job in New Jersey. Indeed, from everything Nunan could gather from the newspaper coverage trumpeting their arrival, the mountain troops were a kind of mythical brotherhood, its members descending like gods from mountaintops all over Europe and North America to save the world from the advancing shadows of evil dictatorship.<br> &nbsp;<br> By the time Nunan arrived in the Cascades, the training at Fort Lewis had been under way for just six months, but already the camp had attracted dozens of the best skiers in the world. The first man to appear at Fort Lewis had been the former captain of the Dartmouth College ski team, Charles McLane. When he showed up wearing his ski team sweater, McLane asked a guard at the main gate where the mountain troops were. After calling headquarters and checking McLane&#x2019;s papers again, the guard looked McLane over and said, &#x201c;Lad, you are the Mountain Infantry. You&#x2019;re a one-man regiment!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> McLane was not lonely for long. As word began to spread that the army was forming its first-ever mountain units, Fort Lewis began to seem more like an Olympic ski lodge than an army base. Hard-eyed European mountaineers&#x2014;many having barely escaped Nazi imprisonment in Austria and Norway&#x2014;had been recruited to turn mostly teenaged Americans into skilled Alpine soldiers. What the Europeans brought to the fledgling troops, in addition to the technical skills necessary for survival in the high mountains, was a tradition of warfare entirely unknown to an American military establishment. Fighting in the mountains required not only specialized equipment and practice, none of which American soldiers possessed, it required an entirely different degree of psychological preparation. American soldiers were used to training at warm, flatland bases in California and the Deep South, and that alone, regardless of how well the men learned their trade, would be a decided disadvantage against an army with centuries of mountain and cold-weather fighting in its history. This history was well known to General Frido von Senger und Etterlin, the commander of the Germans the American mountain troops would eventually face. When it came to fighting in the mountains, physical preparation and military training were only part of the equation, Senger would write. Far more important was for soldiers to overcome the natural dread of dying alone on an exposed slab of Alpine rock. For soldiers accustomed to fighting only in flat country, he wrote, mountains &#x201c;intensify all fears.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Lost Girls (Expanded Edition)</h2><p><b>The groundbreaking, controversial masterpiece of erotic comics, decades in the making, now in a sumptuous hardcover collecting all three volumes, with 32 pages of new artwork and commentary.</b><br><br>For more than a century, Alice, Wendy and Dorothy have been our guides through the Wonderland, Neverland and Land of Oz of our childhoods.

Accompanied by selected passages from the classic commentary of Zhu Xi--one of the most influential and insightful interpreters of Confucianism--this edition provides readers with a parallel to the Chinese practice of reading a classic text alongside traditional commentaries. Also included are an Introduction that situates Mengzi and Zhu Xi in their intellectual and social contexts; a glossary of names, places and important terms; a selected bibliography; and an index.</p></p><p><p>Bryan W. Van Norden is Professor in the Philosophy Department and in the Department of Chinese and Japanese at Vassar College.</p><p>The <i>Mengzi</i> is one of the richest philosophical texts in classical Chinese philosophy, and Van Norden's translation is among the few that do it justice. His translation is further distinguished by its accessibility and is unique in including substantial selections from later commentaries. As such it is both an essential scholarly resource and a great introduction to Confucian thought.--Justin Tiwald, San Francisco State University</p><br><br><p>Bryan W. Van Norden accomplishes two impressive feats in this important new translation of <i>Mengzi<i> (<i>Mencius<i>)</i></i></i></i>. First, he presents the text in a traditional fashion, with indispensable commentary interwoven into--yet always clearly distinct from&#x2014;the text. This opens up the text to modern readers as never before in a translation. Second, he both lets us hear the voice of the text's greatest commentator (Zhu Xi from the twelfth century) and gives us a translation faithful to the text's original time and philosophy. The supple balance with which Van Norden pulls this off makes this translation perfect for students, general readers, and scholars alike.--Stephen Angle, Wesleyan University</p><br><br><p>This is the most accurate, readable, and philosophically revealing version of the <i>Mengzi</i> available. It has the added virtue of a running commentary that weaves together Zhu Xi's explanation of Mengzi's thought with Van Norden's exposition and insights and his selected bibliographies. The inclusion of Zhu Xi's comments allows readers to appreciate more fully not only the depth of Mengzi's original vision but also its power to inspire creative interpretation by one of the greatest minds of the neo-Confucian period. The result is a magnificent work that brings the study and understanding of Mengzi's philosophy to an unprecedented and most impressive level of rigor, sophistication, and interest.--Philip J.

Elaine&#x2019;s did not enjoy a high reputation with the food critics of the local media, because they didn&#x2019;t come often enough to get the good tables, but the regulars knew how good the food was, and that was all she really cared about.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take high praise,&#x201d; Elaine said.<br>Stone&#x2019;s cell phone hummed on his belt, and he dug it out of its holster. &#x201c;Stone Barrington.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Stone, it&#x2019;s Arrington,&#x201d; she said. Stone and Arrington had once been a very big item, to the extent of his having fathered a son by her.<br>&#x201c;Well, hello there,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I thought I&#x2019;d never hear from you again.&#x201d; They had spent one night together in his Maine house, on Islesboro, at Dark Harbor, and then she had taken her leave, saying it was over.<br>&#x201c;I want to hire you,&#x201d; she said.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m for hire. How&#x2019;s Peter?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He misses his father,&#x201d; she said.<br>Stone wondered which father she meant, himself or her late husband, movie megastar Vance Calder, whose son the world believed Peter to be. Stone didn&#x2019;t know what to say.<br>&#x201c;I mean Vance,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;He hardly knows you.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; Stone said. &#x201c;Why do you want to hire me?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to say this fast, because I&#x2019;m sleepy, and I want to go to bed. I know you&#x2019;re at Elaine&#x2019;s at this hour, but I&#x2019;m not.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;So, say it fast.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You remember Centurion Studios? A large Hollywood film factory.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I believe so.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You remember that Vance owned a third of the shares when he died?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know it was that much.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;d been buying the stock for many years, every time somebody died and some shares became available.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Got it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a stockholders&#x2019; meeting coming up, and there will be a vote on whether to sell the studio. It has always been closely held, and Vance wanted to keep it that way.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s buying?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, some corporation or other. They&#x2019;ll sell the property to developers, and the studio will just be a letterhead.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And what do you want me to do?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Vote my shares against the sale, and do what you can to get the other stockholders to vote against it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;How many are there?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;A couple of dozen, maybe. I&#x2019;ll send you a list, along with my signed proxy, to the Bel-Air house. You can have the guesthouse, as usual. Manolo and Carmen will take good care of you.&#x201d;<br>Manolo and Carmen were the Filipino houseman and his wife who ran the place. Stone knew he would be taken care of very well indeed. &#x201c;All right, I guess I can manage that.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Can you get there tomorrow?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Or the day after,&#x201d; Stone said. He wanted to fly himself in his new airplane.<br>&#x201c;I guess that will be all right,&#x201d; she answered. &#x201c;You remember Rick Barron?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, I met him and his wife at Vance&#x2019;s burial.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right. Call him as soon as you get there, and take him and his wife, Glenna, to dinner. Rick is in his nineties now, but he&#x2019;s sharp as a straight razor, and he&#x2019;s leading the fight to keep the studio closely held.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be glad to do that.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;In fact, invite them to the house, and let Manolo and Carmen do the dinner. They know all the Barrons&#x2019; favorite dishes.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;All right.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Call me when you get there?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Will do.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Say hello to Elaine and Dino.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Will do.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Goodbye.&#x201d; She hung up.<br>Stone put away his phone. &#x201c;Arrington says hello to both of you,&#x201d; he said to them.<br>&#x201c;How is she?&#x201d; Elaine asked.<br>&#x201c;Sleepy,&#x201d; Stone replied. &#x201c;Dino, you want to spend a few days in L.A.?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;On whose nickel?&#x201d; Dino asked.<br>&#x201c;Transportation is free, and we&#x2019;ll be staying in Arrington&#x2019;s guesthouse.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m in,&#x201d; Dino said.<br>Mike spoke up. &#x201c;Can you just walk away from the NYPD that way?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I get time off, just like everybody,&#x201d; Dino said, &#x201c;but I get to approve when, and I approve this one.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; Mike said.<br>&#x201c;Mike,&#x201d; Stone said, &#x201c;Dino has the NYPD by the ear, didn&#x2019;t you know? He&#x2019;s a law unto himself over there. The new commissioner, who doesn&#x2019;t know him very well, loves him.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;d love me more, if he knew me better,&#x201d; Dino said.<br>Elaine pinched Dino&#x2019;s cheek. &#x201c;To know him is to love him,&#x201d; she said, planting a big kiss on his forehead. She got up and made her move to the next table of regulars.<br>Dino rubbed his cheek. &#x201c;I hope she didn&#x2019;t make a bruise.&#x201d; &#x201c;With that five o&#x2019;clock shadow, who could tell?&#x201d; Stone asked.<br>&#x201c;You guys have the life,&#x201d; Mike said. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;ll bet you&#x2019;re going to fly the Mustang out there.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You betcha,&#x201d; Stone replied.<br>&#x201c;Hey, wait a minute,&#x201d; Dino said. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t volunteer for suicide.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s time you had your first flight in the Citation Mustang,&#x201d; Stone said.<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s right, Dino,&#x201d; Mike echoed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll love it.&#x201d;<br>Dino looked doubtful. &#x201c;I just don&#x2019;t know if God intended Stone to be put in charge of a jet airplane.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You liked my old airplane well enough,&#x201d; Stone said.<br>&#x201c;Yeah, but it had a propeller up front that made it go, and I took comfort in that.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The Mustang has two engines, Dino,&#x201d; Mike said, &#x201c;and they&#x2019;re fan jets. Twice the safety.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No propellers, though.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Propellers would just slow it down,&#x201d; Stone said.<br>&#x201c;Mike, you think I should do this?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve flown with him, Dino; he&#x2019;ll get you there.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well, okay, if you say so.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You get a choice of seats,&#x201d; Stone said. &#x201c;Up front with me, or you can lounge in the back and sleep all the way.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;How could I sleep with you at the controls?&#x201d; Dino asked. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take my chances up front, where I can do something, if I have to.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll teach you to fly the airplane, Dino,&#x201d; Stone said.<br>&#x201c;Hey, that&#x2019;s a good idea.

The new edition includes extensive discussion of the Draft Restatement (Third) of Consumer Contracts. There are new cases on telemarketing, good faith, the perfect tender rule, warranties and reliance, half-truths, fraud liability between contracting parties, class arbitration, adequate assurances, mitigation, mental anguish, intentional interference, and personal services contracts. And the authors have added three new drafting exercises to the many practice problems that the book has always included.<br><br>This edition makes some structural changes to the chapter on remedies to make it more accessible to students. The discussion now begins with general principles, such as the choice between damages and specific performance, efficient breach, and the foreseeability, mitigation and certainty rules.

Then a trapper found a chunk of gold, and everything changed overnight.<br><br>In six days a town called Confusion appeared . . . and on the seventh it could disappear, consumed by the flames of lawlessness and violence. On one side are those who understand only brute force. On the other are men who want law and order but are ready to use a noose to achieve their ends. Between them stand Matt Coburn and Dick Felton: one a hardened realist, the other an idealist trying to dig a fortune from the muddy hillside. Outnumbered and outgunned, Felton and Coburn can&#x2019;t afford to be outmaneuvered. For as the two unlikely allies confront corruption, betrayal, and murder in an attempt to tame a town where the discovery of gold can mean either the fortune of a lifetime or a sentence of death, they realize that any move could be their last.</p><p>On the edge of the frontier, boomtowns like Confusion sprang up overnight. Here honest men came to work the mines, while thieves, gamblers and outlaws worked on them. But in Confusion there was more at stake than law and order--the mines themselves were the target of a violent plot. Matt Coburn had cleaned up tough towns before, but he wanted no part of Confusion. Too many enemies knew he was there, too many lies had been told. Now there&#39;s only one way out of Confusion for Coburn--a path of honor that could cost him his life.Our foremost storyteller of the American West, <b>Louis L&#x2019;Amour </b>has thrilled a nation by chronicling the adventures of the brave men and woman who settled the frontier.

Mingling acute observation with often wild speculation, it offers a fascinating view of the world as it was understood in the first century AD, whether describing the danger of diving for sponges, the first water-clock, or the use of asses&#x2019; milk to remove wrinkles. Pliny himself died while investigating the volcanic eruption that destroyed Pompeii in AD 79, and the natural curiosity that brought about his death is also very much evident in the Natural History &#x2014; a book that proved highly influential right up until the Renaissance and that his nephew, Pliny the younger, described &#x2018;as full of variety as nature itself&#x2019;.<p>John F.

While Merteuil challenges Valmont to seduce an innocent convent girl, he is also occupied with the conquest of a virtuous married woman.

Its prime movers, the Vicomte de Valmont and the Marquise de Merteuil, gifted, wealthy, and bored, form an unholy alliance and turn seduction into a game - a game which they must win. And they play with such wit and style that it is impossible not to admire them - until they discover that the game has mysterious rules that they cannot understand. In the ensuing vicious battle there can be no victors, and the innocent will suffer with the guilty. This new translation gives Laclos a modern voice, and readers will be able to judge whether the novel is as &#39;diabolical&#39; and &#39;infamous&#39; as its critics have claimed, or whether it has much to tell us about the kind of world we ourselves live in.<b>Pierre Choderlos De Laclos</b>&nbsp;(1741-1803) was born in Amiens. His family was respectable but not distinguished, and at eighteen he entered the army and spent the next twenty years in various garrison towns, and reached the rank of&nbsp;<i>capitaine-commandant</i>&nbsp;without ever seeing battle. He cut a dash in provincial society, however, and in his spare time wrote light verse, some of which was published. He wrote the libretto for&nbsp;<i>Ernestine</i>, a comic opera, which was produced in Paris in 1777, but was not received well. In 1779 he was sent to the island of Aix, off La Rochelle, where&nbsp;<i>Les Liaisons Dangereuses</i>&nbsp;was conceived and written. He went to Paris in 1781 to supervise the publishing of his book, overstayed his leave and was promptly ordered back to his regiment. He married Marie-Solange Duperre in 1786 and proved to be an exemplary husband and father. He left the army in 1788, entering politics, and was imprisoned twice during the Reign of Terror, but returned to the army as a general under Napoleon in 1800. He died in Italy in 1803. Laclos also wrote a treatise on the education of women and on Vauban. Towards the end of his life he was considering writing another one to show that true happiness could only be attained in family life.</p><h2>Unglued Bible Study Participant&#39;s Guide: Making Wise Choices in the Midst of Raw Emotions</h2><p><p>In this six-session small group Bible study (DVD/digital video sold separately), Lysa Terkeurst teaches participants how to process emotions and resolve conflicts in ways that lead to a much more peaceful life.</p><p>Lysa TerKeurst admits that she, like most women, has experiences where others bump into her &#x201c;happy&#x201d; causing her to come emotionally unglued.&nbsp;What do we often do with our raw emotions?

And all those brave men who&#x2019;d risked everything to end the bloody war were dead with her, and they&#x2019;d left wives and children to wonder what had happened to them, to mourn, endlessly. Had their deaths been quick? Crushing tons of icy water and then it was over, quickly, so quickly, they didn&#x2019;t know the end was on them? He prayed it was so. All he had left of her was the letter she&#x2019;d stuffed in Leo&#x2019;s coat pocket to give to him, his first name written in her hand on the envelope. <i>Josef.</i> All that was inside were her hastily scribbled words explaining what she&#x2019;d done and why, and how much she loved him and Leo, and how, with God&#x2019;s help, she would see them soon. Stay safe, stay safe, and all would be well. Signed simply, <i>Ansonia.</i></p><p>Josef closed his eyes against the pain of it, a pain so deep he didn&#x2019;t think he could bear it. But he had to, he had no choice, for there was Leo, their son, depending on him since his mother was gone. He saw her now, his brave, foolhardy Ansonia, saw them together that last night, and thought now her smile had been sad, accepting, as if she&#x2019;d known she would die. He shut it off.</p><p>Josef Rothschild would mourn her forever, but not yet, not just yet. He stared through the front window down the long, dark drive, then over at the thick night dark woods. Pearce would be here soon with five other Order members. William Pearce, Viscount Chambers, the head of the Highest Order, his friend and ally for such a short time. He knew it would last until they both breathed their last breaths, this odd friendship of theirs, a German and an Englishman, forged that long-ago night at the battleground of Verdun. He wondered if William would one day be the Prime Minister. Josef wouldn&#x2019;t doubt it. Even though William was young, he already had power, wealth, but most important, he had an excellent brain, a clear head, and honor.</p><p>Josef stared into the darkness. Where were they?</p><p>Six men of the Highest Order were coming to hear him announce that their plan had succeeded. <i>The Highest Order</i>&#x2014;Josef had always thought the formal title of their society sounded so lofty as to be ordained by God&#x2014;but now all members simply called it the Order. Yes, six members of the Order were coming to hear not only that they now had the kaiser&#x2019;s gold, but that they also possessed Marie&#x2019;s key and her book of secrets. Yes, they&#x2019;d won, they would deal the kaiser a death blow, and they would raise a toast to Marie, magnificent Marie, architect of a weapon so powerful the one who owned it would rule the world.</p><p>But there wasn&#x2019;t to be wild triumph, because the scores of gold bars worth millions of deutsche marks, the kaiser&#x2019;s private treasury, the book, and the key were lost to both Germany and England in waters so deep he couldn&#x2019;t imagine the U-boat ever being found. In England&#x2019;s hands, having the gold would cripple the kaiser&#x2019;s war, but having Marie&#x2019;s horrifying weapon would deal a death blow. Now no one would have either the gold or the weapon, ever. Still, he wondered if someone in the distant future would find the U-boat and the kaiser&#x2019;s gold and Marie&#x2019;s key. Would they marvel at the lunacy of men long dead? Marvel at their greed, their eagerness to crush one another, their butchering of the innocent? Would they look at Marie&#x2019;s weapon and be unable to fathom how any man, any country, could sanction its use?</p><p>Josef pulled the thin curtain back from the window and stared out into full darkness. There was no moon and the few stars shimmered off the ground fog covering the field beyond the cottage. The men would leave their cars hidden and come into the cottage one by one. The Order was always careful, rabidly so in wartime. Soon, soon now.</p><p>Josef looked over at the trundle bed in the corner, at his son, Leo, exhausted from his ordeal, still in shock. At last he was sleeping soundly, legs pulled up against his chest, one thin arm dangling over the edge of the cot, the small white hand open. Josef felt such fear, such love, that for a moment he couldn&#x2019;t breathe. If his son had died, it would have been his fault. But he was alive, he&#x2019;d survived the hellish trip from Berlin to Scotland, the specter of death constantly riding on his small shoulders. Josef prayed Leo had understood all he&#x2019;d told him on their trip from Scotland to William Pearce&#x2019;s cottage, understood that what his father and the other men had tried to do had been for him, for all the children of this useless, bloody war. Every time he&#x2019;d said Ansonia&#x2019;s name, he&#x2019;d tasted his own tears. And when he was through talking, the tears shiny on his cheeks, Leo had slipped his small hand into his father&#x2019;s and whispered, &#x201c;Before we left her, Mama told me you were a hero. Now I understand why. What will happen now, Papa?&#x201d;</p><p>Josef was humbled. He had no answer.</p><p>He looked out the window again. He saw a shadow running across the field, and another, wraiths in the night, the darkness bleeding around them. They would stagger their arrivals, each coming from a different direction, a few minutes between them. Six men, dressed in black, weapons at their sides. Three carried Webley&nbsp;.455 Marks, standard issue, and two had Mauser C96s tucked in their holsters. They were prepared for anything even though they should be safe enough, here in a small cottage deep in the Cotswolds, expecting to hear news of their triumph.</p><p>The first man stopped, whistled loudly through his teeth in a poor imitation of a whip-poor-will. Josef whistled in return, and the man started forward again. A series of calls and answers began behind him.</p><p>The first knock sounded. Four taps, then two pounds. The signal.</p><p>Josef took one last look at Leo, then pinched out the lone candle. He opened the door, welcomed each of them. Their only goal was to stop Kaiser Wilhelm&#x2019;s war.</p><p>Only five men arrived. Where was William Pearce? He was never late. Josef gave all of them coffee, then, unable to wait, said, &#x201c;The U-boat went down. The kaiser has lost both his gold and Marie&#x2019;s book and the key. And we did, too.&#x201d;</p><p>Dead silence, then, with succinct finality, Wallace Benton-Hurt, head of the Bank of England, said, &#x201c;So it&#x2019;s a stalemate.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said Josef.</p><p>&#x201c;I hear something, it must be William,&#x201d; said Grayson Lankford, and went to the door.</p><p>Josef said, &#x201c;Wait until he knocks.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No one knows we&#x2019;re here, Josef. You&#x2019;re being paranoid.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, I am,&#x201d; Josef said, &#x201c;and that is the only reason I am still alive. Wait for the knock.&#x201d;</p><p>Everyone waited, watching the door. Footsteps, then a knock. Two raps, sharp, like the end of a stick, or a rifle butt.</p><p>Not the right signal.</p><p>Josef knew they&#x2019;d been found out. <i>Leo.</i></p><p>He grabbed Leo into his arms and carried him to the closet. Leo&#x2019;s eyes opened, unseeing at first, then he focused on his father&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;Listen to me, you have to stay here until I come for you. Do not make a sound. Do you understand me?&#x201d;</p><p>Leo knew fear, and he saw it on his father&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;Are we in danger, Papa?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, the enemy found us. You must keep quiet, Leo. Remember what I told you. If something happens to me, you tell no one what I told you. Trust no one. Remember, no matter what you hear, you keep quiet.&#x201d; He kissed his boy, wrapped the blanket around him, and closed the closet door just as bullets shattered the glass windows and the front door burst open.</p><p></p><p></p><p>DAY ONE</p><p></p><p></p><p>1</p><p>FBI New York Field Office</p><p>26 Federal Plaza</p><p>7:25 a.m.</p><p><i>What in bloody hell have I done</i>?</p><p>Nicholas Drummond reported for duty at the FBI&#x2019;s New York Headquarters smartly at 7:00 a.m., as instructed. After twenty minutes with human resources, he felt a bit like a schoolboy: stand here, walk there, smile for your photograph, here&#x2019;s your pass, don&#x2019;t lose it. It was worse than the FBI Academy with their strict rules, the uniforms, the endless drills, and more like his training at Hendon Police College with Hamish Penderley and his team.</p><p>The administrative realities of moving from New Scotland Yard to the FBI in New York were decidedly less romantic than the initial prospect had been. Months earlier, Dillon Savich, head of the Criminal Apprehension Unit at FBI Headquarters in Washington, D.C., had encouraged Nicholas to make a new home in the FBI, and he&#x2019;d accepted. It was now the end of May, graduation from Quantico and the FBI Academy two weeks in the past, and he was officially an FBI special agent, and technically at the bottom of the food chain.</p><p>Again.</p><p>Twice he&#x2019;d done this. The first time he&#x2019;d left the Foreign Office to work for the Metropolitan Police in London. He&#x2019;d survived those first days and he&#x2019;d survive these, too.</p><p><i>And even better, you don&#x2019;t have Hamish Penderley to ride you now, making you do tactical drills at 5:00 a.m. Zachery&#x2019;s a very different sort. So buck up.</i></p><p>Nicholas knew he should have started out in a small Bureau office in the Midwest, gotten his feet wet, but Dillon Savich had gotten him assigned to the New York Field Office, as promised, working directly for Supervisory Special Agent Milo Zachery, a man Nicholas knew and trusted, with Special Agent Michaela Caine as his partner.</p><p>When at last they issued him his service weapon, he felt complete, the heavy weight of the Glock on his hip comforting, familiar.</p><p>Freshly laminated and now armed, he&#x2019;d been walked to the twenty-third floor, led through the maze of the cube farm, and ushered into a small space, blue-walled with some sort of fuzzy fabric, the kind Velcro would adhere to, with a brown slab of wood-grained Formica as a desktop. There was a computer, several hard drives, two file trays labeled IN and OUT, and a chair.</p><p>The cubicle was so small he could easily touch each side with his arms outstretched, and that made the tiniest bit of claustrophobia sneak in. He needed more monitors and more shelving and maybe he&#x2019;d soon feel at home. Once in the zone on his computers, the close quarters wouldn&#x2019;t be a problem.</p><p>He dropped his briefcase on the floor next to the chair, stashed a small black go bag in his bottom drawer, and took a seat. He spun the chair around in a circle, legs drawn up to avoid crashing. Small, yes, but it would do. He didn&#x2019;t plan to spend much time sitting here, anyway. Part of the deal he&#x2019;d made with Savich meant Nicholas would be working ad hoc<i> </i>with him at times, running forensic point on cases in Washington. From what he&#x2019;d already experienced working with Savich and Sherlock and Mike Caine, he was in for a ride.</p><p>A low, throaty voice said near his ear, &#x201c;Needs a bit of sprucing up, don&#x2019;t you think? How about a nice photo of the queen, front and center?&#x201d;</p><p>Speak of the devil.</p><p>&#x201c;The queen is hanging happily over my bed in my new digs.&#x201d; He bent his head back to see Agent Mike Caine looking down at him, smiling widely. She was wearing her signature black jeans, motorcycle boots, her blond hair pulled back in a ponytail. Her badge hung on a lanyard around her neck, and her black-rimmed reading glasses were tucked into her blouse pocket.</p><p>&#x201c;I wonder why I didn&#x2019;t smell you first.&#x201d; And he leaned up, sniffed. &#x201c;Ah, there it is, that lovely jasmine, like my mum. Hi, Mike, long time no see.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, yeah, all of two weeks since your graduation. So you&#x2019;re all settled in to these new digs of yours? By the way, where are your new digs?&#x201d;</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t want to tell her, didn&#x2019;t want to tell anyone, it was too embarrassing. Fact was, he&#x2019;d lost a big argument with his grandfather about where he&#x2019;d lay his head in New York. He shrugged, looked over her shoulder at several agents walking by. &#x201c;All settled in. A fairly nice bed in an okay place over there&#x2014;&#x201d; And he waved his hand vaguely toward the east.</p><p>She cocked her head at him, and he said quickly, &#x201c;You look pretty good after being on your own for four months. When can we get out of here?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Champing at the bit for a case already, Special Agent Drummond? You&#x2019;ve only been here fifteen minutes. We haven&#x2019;t even had time to go over the coffee schedule and introduce you around. Are we calling you Nick or Nicholas these days?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You know what they say about rolling stones and moss. Nicholas will do fine.&#x201d;</p><p>She looked at her watch. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re in luck. We&#x2019;ve caught a murder.&#x201d;</p><p>He felt the punch of adrenaline. &#x201c;A murder? Is it terrorism related?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so. I heard about it two minutes ago. Time to get briefed.&#x201d;</p><p>Milo Zachery joined them in the hall. In his tailored gray suit, white shirt, and purple-and-black striped tie, Nicholas thought he looked a lot snazzier than Penderley ever had. Slick clothes, fresh haircut. He looked like a big-dog federal agent all the way to his highly polished wing tips. Nicholas knew Zachery was focused, smart, and willing to let his agents use their brains with only subtle hands on the reins.</p><p>Nicholas shook his new boss&#x2019;s hand.</p><p>&#x201c;Good to see you, Drummond. I&#x2019;ll handle your briefing myself. Walk with me.&#x201d;</p><p>Mike gave him a manic grin, her adrenaline on a level with his, and he was reminded of that night in Paris several months earlier, Mike barely upright, leaning against the overturned couch, bleeding from a gunshot to the arm, her face beat up, and smiling. He thanked the good Lord she was here and whole and ready to kick butt.</p><p>Nicholas smiled back and gestured for her to go first.</p><p>&#x201c;Such lovely manners from the first Brit in the FBI. I could get used to this.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Still cheeky, are we? It&#x2019;s good to see that some things haven&#x2019;t changed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Come on, you two.&#x201d; Zachery walked them past his office, down the blue-carpeted senior management hallway, straight out the door and to the elevators. As he punched the down button, he said, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re headed to Twenty-six Wall Street. Stabbing. The NYPD called us since it&#x2019;s on federal land, so it&#x2019;s our case. I thought it would be a good idea to get Drummond here liaising with the locals as soon as possible. And aren&#x2019;t you two lucky, someone managed to get themselves dead on your first morning. Go on down there and figure out what happened.&#x201d;</p><p>The elevator doors opened and Zachery waved them in. &#x201c;Drummond, I know you&#x2019;re going to be our big cyber-crime computer-terrorism guy, but we also need to teach you to drive on the right side of the road, get your boots dirty on the ground first.&#x201d; He smiled and clapped Nicholas on the shoulder. &#x201c;Glad you&#x2019;re with us, Drummond. Welcome to the FBI. Good hunting.&#x201d; He turned, and said over his shoulder, &#x201c;Oh, yes. Mike, keep him in line.&#x201d;</p><p></p><p></p><p>2</p><p>Mike&#x2019;s black Crown Vic waited for them in the garage. She jangled the car keys at Nicholas, then drew them back. &#x201c;Maybe I should drive, even though you need the practice. Wall Street&#x2019;s pretty crazy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Contrary to popular belief, I do know how to manage the streets of New York. I have American blood, too, you know.&#x201d;</p><p>She laughed and got behind the wheel. Once they were out of the garage, she said, &#x201c;Next time out, you&#x2019;ll drive. It&#x2019;s a requirement that you know all the streets. But not today. So tell me, did you really live up to Savich&#x2019;s lofty standards at the Academy? And Sherlock&#x2019;s?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I tried my pitiful best, Agent Caine.&#x201d; He watched her come within an inc...</p></p><h2>The Forgiven: A Novel</h2><p><p><b>In this haunting novel, journalist and novelist Lawrence Osborne explores the reverberations of a random accident on the lives of Moroccan Muslims and Western visitors who converge on a luxurious desert villa for a decadent weekend-long party.&nbsp;<br></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; David and Jo Henniger, a doctor and a children's book author, in search of an escape from their less than happy lives in London, accept an invitation to attend a bacchanal at their old friends' home, deep in the Moroccan desert. But as a groggy David navigates the dark desert roads, two young men spring from the roadside, the car swerves...and one boy is left dead.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When David and Jo arrive at the party, the Moroccan staff, already disgusted&nbsp;by the rich, hedonistic foreigners in their midst, soon learn of David's unforgiveable act. Then the boy's irate Berber father appears, and events begin to spin beyond anyone's control.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With spare, evocative prose, searing eroticism, and a gift for the unexpected, Osborne memorably portrays the privileged guests wrestling with their secrets amid the remoteness and beauty of the desert landscape. He gradually reveals the jolting backstory of the young man who was killed and leaves David&#x2019;s fate in the balance as the novel builds to a shattering conclusion.<br><br>Now with Extra Libris material, including a&nbsp;Q&amp;A and bonus content</p></p><p><p>A celebrated novelist and journalist, <b>LAWRENCE OSBORNE</b> is the author of six travel narratives, including <i>The Wet and the Dry. </i>His latest novel,<i> The Ballad of a Small Player</i> is out in April 2014.<i> </i>He has written for the <i>New York Times Magazine</i>, the <i>Wall Street Journal Magazine, </i>the <i>New Yorker</i>, <i>Forbes</i>, <i>Harper's</i>, and several other publications.

The mists broke apart and motorboats with European millionaires came swooping out of the blue with Sotogrande flags and a flash of tumblers. The migrants on the top deck began to shoulder their bags, revived by the idea of home, and the look of anxiety that hovered in their faces began to dispel. Perhaps it was just the sun. Their secondhand cars stored in the hull revved as their children scattered about with oranges in their hands, and an energy seemed to reach out from the edge of Africa to the Algeciras ferry, polarizing it. The Europeans stiffened.<br><br>Sunbathing in their deck chairs, the British couple were surprised by the height of the land. On the tops of the mountains stood white antenna masts like lighthouses made of wire, and the mountains had a feltlike greenness that made you want to reach out and touch them. The Pillars of Hercules had stood near here, where the Atlantic rushes into the Mediterranean. There are places that are destined to seem like gates. One can&#x2019;t avoid the sensation of being sucked through a portal. The Englishman, a doctor of a certain age, shaded his eyes with a hand bristling with ginger hairs.<br><br>Even with the naked eye, they could make out the snaking outlines of roads that might have been there since Roman times. David Henniger thought, &#x201c;Perhaps it&#x2019;ll be easier than we think, this drive. Perhaps it&#x2019;ll be a pleasure after all.&#x201d; From a boom box near the flagpole came a few bars of rai, of Paris hip-hop. He watched his wife reading a Spanish paper, flicking the pages back and forth indifferently, then glanced down at his watch. People were waving from the approaching city, raising handkerchiefs and fingers, and Jo took off her shades for a moment to see where she was. He admired the frank confusion written all over her face. L&#x2019;Afrique.<br>They went for a beer at the Hotel d&#x2019;Angleterre. It was not hot. The air was wet with recently broken mist. Con men and pretty &#x201c;guides&#x201d; danced around them while the sun drenched the terrace with a smell of varnish and peppercorns and stale beer. A laughing mood dominated the seedy expats and their hangers-on nursing their plates of unshelled nuts and their cooled gins. We were once the most formidable bohemians, their faces said to the newcomers, and now we are delightful, playful shits because we have no choice.<br><br>The Hennigers had arranged for an agent to deal with the car rental, a man who would run back and forth with keys and contracts, and while they waited for him, they had a few beers with grenadine and some fried goat cheese cigares. He waited to form an impression. The streets seemed massively solid with their French facades, and there was a gritty shade at their bottom. The girls were swift and insolent, with adultery in their eyes. It wasn&#x2019;t bad.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad we aren&#x2019;t staying,&#x201d; she said, biting her lip.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll stay on the way back. It&#x2019;ll be interesting.&#x201d;<br><br>He took off his tie. His eyes felt intensely alive somehow and he wondered if she ever noticed these slight alterations of mood, of intention. &#x201c;I like it,&#x201d; he thought. &#x201c;I like it better than she does. Maybe we&#x2019;ll stay a little after the weekend.&#x201d;<br><br>On the road to Chefchaouen, they didn&#x2019;t speak. The car rented from Avis Tangier was an old Camry, its brakes soft and its red leather torn. He drove it nervously in his perforated driving gloves, warily avoiding the women in ribboned straw hats who infested the hard shoulder, pushing mules ahead of them with sticks. The sun grew fierce; it was a long road bordered by stones and orange trees, and above it rose the hillside slums, the gimcrack apartment blocks, the antennas that decorate every middle-income city. One couldn&#x2019;t see the beginning or the end of it. There was just the taste of sea.<br><br>All was dust. He drove on doggedly, determined to get out of the city as fast as possible. The light all day had finally worn his eyes down; the road was reduced to a geometric glare alive with hostile movements: animals, children, trucks, broken-down thirty-year-old Mercedes.<br><br>The suburbs of Tangier were ruined, but the gardens were still there. And so were the crippled lemon trees and olives, the dogged disillusion and empty factories, the smell of seething young men.<br>The Hotel Salam in Chefchaouen looked over a river called the Oued el Kebir and a gorge; the road on which it stood, avenue Hassan II, was a steep lane of hotels, for the Marrakech and the Madrid were just next door, and along it the city walls loomed up, white and monkish. The tour buses were already there; the salon was full of Dutch couples feeding upon mountains of turmeric eggs. The Hennigers were not sure whether to enter the hotel lounge and participate in this buffet orgy or to stay aloof. The Dutch looked frantic and disturbed, as if they hadn&#x2019;t eaten in days. David wondered if they were given sandwiches on their immense buses. They were faintly disgusting, with their big red faces and their beefy adolescent ruminants grazing around the buffet tables. He was hungry himself.<br><br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s eat straightaway,&#x201d; he said excitedly, &#x201c;but not here. Perhaps outside, away from the Continental wildebeest? I wonder if one can get a drink that isn&#x2019;t Pellegrino Citrus?&#x201d;<br><br>Fortunately the Salam had its own terrace and it was not too crowded. They took a table with views and ate their tagine citron with a bottle of cold Boullebemme. It was wine, at least, and he said a silent thank-you to it.<br><br>&#x201c;Should you be drinking?&#x201d; she asked quietly.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, it&#x2019;s just a glass. A glass of fly pee. This stuff is fly pee. Look at it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not fly pee. It&#x2019;s fourteen percent. You have to drive another five hours.&#x201d;<br><br>She began to devour the salted olives at their table. David always took these sorts of remarks in his stride, and he settled down.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;ll make it easier. I know it&#x2019;s the lame excuse of every alcoholic. But it will.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I shouldn&#x2019;t let you, Stumblebum.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I would anyway. The roads are empty.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What about the trees?&#x201d;<br><br>There had been eleven years of this sort of contest; the exact, fastidious Jo crossing lances with the bad-tempered David, who always felt that women were out to suppress the peccadilloes that made life half worth living. Why did they do this? Were they envious of life shimmering away with improvised masculine curiosities and pleasures without their consent? One had to ask the question. You could smile or not--it was up to you. Jo was ten years younger than him, a mere forty-one, but she acted like an ancient nanny. She enjoyed reproving him, pulling him back from tiny adventures that would have no consequences even if they were allowed to degenerate to their natural conclusions. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d never hit a tree anyway,&#x201d; he thought. &#x201c;Never in a thousand years. Not even in my sleep.&#x201d; She swallowed half a glass of the raw Moroccan wine and he raised an arch eyebrow. She wiped her mouth defiantly. The blood rushed into her brow, into the corners of her mouth.<br><br>&#x201c;You always get what you want, David. It&#x2019;s our schema, isn&#x2019;t it? You always do what you bloody want.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not putting your life in danger.&#x201d; His voice was a little pleading. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s absurd.&#x201d;<br><br>We&#x2019;ll see if it&#x2019;s absurd, she thought.<br><br>&#x201c;Also,&#x201d; he went on coolly, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s patently not true. I very rarely, as you put it, get to do what I want. Most of the time, I am following orders.&#x201d;<br><br>At the bottom of the gorge stood white houses with jars of salted lemons on their roofs. Around them, dogs barked in the palm groves, and the waiters at the Salam seemed subtly ashamed of them. One of the Dutch beauties floated in the little terrace pool, rotating slowly under the first stars while gazing at her own toes. He watched her with meticulous curiosity. Her breasts nicely rounded, parting the waters. The dinner was short and efficient, because their minds were racing ahead to the journey instead of enjoying the present moment. Afterward, he finished the remains of the Boullebemme and cleaned his teeth with a pick from the center of the table. Something in his voice was not quite right.<br><br>&#x201c;I feel like going for a walk. Let&#x2019;s get coffee up at the kasbah, no? The waiters here are making me feel gloomy.&#x201d;<br><br>Avenue Hassan II led straight into the Bab El Hammar and the kasbah by way of the lovely place El Makhzen. In the first hour of dimming, the menfolk were out in force on the long square filled with trees, eager for debate in crisply laundered djellabas; they stood around in circular groups holding hands, fingering rosaries behind their backs.<br><br>There was something shrill but paradoxically quiet about the masculine cleanliness, the speed of the children whistling about with shopping bags and peaches. The whitewash, the angular shadows. She gripped his hand, the marriage ring biting into his palm, and she held on to it as if it would provide long, consecutive moments of stability inside this flux. Did she need him more for a little while, just enough to get through this town? The petty disputes of the last few weeks melted away and in the end it was all just words and words, she thought, words that melt away easily as soon as you are in a strong enough sun and you are moving. They found a lopsided square with a fig tree where there was a Cafe du Miel with tables that all leaned to one side on the slope on cedarwood legs. It offered no drinks, but strong coffee with grains and a good smoke, and he felt at home at once. There was a saucer of cardamom seeds for the coffee and a plate of almond pastries. Small acts of delicacy. The streets were patriarchal, if you liked, but they possessed intimacy. The trees made delicate shadows on the underfoot stones. He stretched and dropped a cardamom pod into his coffee.<br><br>&#x201c;I feel less tired now. I think this afternoon was the worst stretch. If we leave at seven, we can be there by midnight or so.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you think they&#x2019;ll wait up?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;ll wait up. We&#x2019;re a large percentage of their weekend emotionally speaking. They&#x2019;ll be boozing long past midnight.&#x201d;<br><br>Or all night, she thought hopefully.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not a military timetable,&#x201d; he said with more conciliation. &#x201c;If you want to stay here a night, I don&#x2019;t mind. I was thinking . . . two nights of party might well be more than enough.&#x201d;<br><br>She shook her head.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to, I want to get to Richard&#x2019;s place.&#x201d;<br><br>In a moment, her eyes brimmed over, and she felt an irrational hatred of the whole situation. It was the usual things. The heat and the thick coffee and the stickiness in the air and the tone in his voice. That clipped and impatient twang seemed to go so perfectly with the way the men in the cafes stared at them with their eyes held back in some way, yet sharpened by their provincial curiosity and used like pointed sticks to pry. She had thought a trip through the desert would give her ideas for a new book, but such calculations rarely pan out. What kind of new book after all? Instead, she was beginning to feel boxed in by the schedule to which they had to stick, and the men in the street stared and stared and their hands played with rosaries on the surfaces of the tables. They stared so hard she felt her center of gravity giving way. They stared with a blank hatred, but it was equally possible that it was not hatred but a sense of unconscious superiority that did not even need to be conscious in order to put the other in her place.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be all right,&#x201d; he said tersely. &#x201c;We know they&#x2019;re repressed and enraged. They treat their woman like donkeys. For them, you are an escaped donkey.&#x201d;<br><br>She looked away, and she was gripping her napkin.<br><br>&#x201c;I hate it when you say that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why? It&#x2019;s true, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t matter if it is.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I would say it mattered,&#x201d; he countered. &#x201c;I would say it mattered if they disliked your presence because of your sex.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure it isn&#x2019;t that. And you have no idea how they treat their women--none.&#x201d;<br><br>He laughed and picked up a cardamom with two fingers. She was being sophistic.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, have it your way, Miss Feminist.&#x201d;<br><br>Wanting to show off his French, he asked the owner of the Cafe du Miel seated at the next table how hot it was in the desert. The Moroccans went into the usual exaggerations.<br><br>&#x201c;Vous allez souffrir, vous allez voir. Mais c&#x2019;i beau, c&#x2019;i tres beau.&#x201d;<br><br>On the walk back to the Salam, he took her hand. The dogs were so loud in the gorge that he couldn&#x2019;t relax; his mind began to turn with a pitiless inertia all its own. Had it been a good idea, he wondered, this extravagance, this sudden departing, this rush to amusement? All for the sake of fun and friendship and three days under a fiercer sun. He knew she hadn&#x2019;t wanted to come. But something in him enjoyed the coercion he was imposing upon her. He liked pissing people off when he thought their irritations sprang from their rigidity and hypocrisy, and hers certainly did. He thought of himself as a cleansing agent, a purifier of other people&#x2019;s prejudice. She would be better off for it in the long run, he was certain, and as he thought this, a delicious pity crept into his calculations, a grim tenderness that had no actual purpose relative to his wife. It was like tending a pasture, clipping the edges with a sharp pair of shears. Keeping order with love and keeping the monsters at bay.<br><br>The Spanish Mosque was lit up, the water on the terrace pool flashing as the wind hit it. Two men walked arm in arm down Hassan II, whispering intently. No women on the streets now; it was the hour of men. Their eyes were upon the tall blonde in her worn cotton dress and red sandals, her jewelry and freckles. There was evidently a pleasure simply in tracking such a gazelle (that was the word they liked). Her gait that hoped to conceal itself from sexual curiosity, not quite a woman&#x2019;s sassy walk.

G. M. Gilbert, the prison psychologist, had an unrivaled firsthand opportunity to watch and question the Nazi war criminals. With scientific dispassion he encouraged G�ering, Speer, Hess, Ribbentrop, Frank, Jodl, Keitel, Streicher, and the others to reveal their innermost thoughts. In the process Gilbert exposed what motivated them to create the distorted Aryan utopia and the nightmarish worlds of Auschwitz, Dachau, and Buchenwald. Here are their day-to-day reactions to the trial proceedings; their off-the-record opinions of Hitler, the Third Reich, and each other; their views on slave labor, death camps, and the Jews; their testimony, feuds, and desperate maneuverings to dissociate themselves from the Third Reich&#39;s defeat and Nazi guilt. Dr. Gilbert&#39;s thorough knowledge of German, deliberately informal approach, and complete freedom of access at all times to the defendants give his spellbinding, chilling study an intimacy and insight that remains unequaled.</p><p>In August 1945 Great Britain, France, the USSR and the United States established a tribunal at Nuremberg to try military and civilian leaders of the Nazi regime for the plotting of aggressive warfare, the extermination of civilian populations, the widespread use of slave labor, the looting of occupied countries, and the maltreatment and murder of prisoners of war.

He took a deep breath. &#x201c;Well, Laurence, why don&#x2019;t we start with your telling me about -yourself?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What would you like to know?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sixty-second bio.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;All right. I&#x2019;m thirty years old. I was born in West Palm Beach, Florida. When I was eight, my mother, who was the manager of a small hotel in our community, was swept off her feet by an Englishman, who was an investor in the hotel. She subsequently divorced my father, married the Brit, and he took the two of us to live in England, where, except for summers, when I visited my father, I grew up. In fact, I became, for all practical purposes, English, including my accent.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I thought I caught a bit of that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My American accent comes back when I&#x2019;m here.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Go on.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I was educated at my stepfather&#x2019;s old schools, Eton and Oxford, and after I graduated, I became a tutor at Eton, later an assistant master, teaching English and art history. My stepfather has a successful advertising agency, and I had no interest in a career in his company or any other business.&#x201d;<br><br>Fred knocked on the door and stepped in. &#x201c;Shall I take your bags up, sir?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Please, Fred. Oh, and this is Mr. Laurence Hayward.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How do you do?&#x201d; Laurence said, becoming English, and they shook hands.<br><br>&#x201c;Fred, what is Laurence&#x2019;s accent?&#x201d; Stone asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Eton and Oxford, I should think,&#x201d; Fred replied.<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you, Fred. You can take the bags up. I&#x2019;ll be here for a while.&#x201d;<br><br>Fred departed.<br><br>&#x201c;That was remarkable, the way Fred picked up on my accent.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Fred is very good at speaking and recognizing British accents of all sorts,&#x201d; Stone said. &#x201c;On with your bio.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I took a leave of absence from Eton and came home to Palm Beach a couple of months ago, after my father fell ill. He had moved to the island from West Palm some years ago as his legal practice grew.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What sort of legal practice?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Real estate. He spent most of his day closing sales and mortgages. Did quite well at it, and used the job to find good investment opportunities in real estate. He died three weeks ago.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry for your loss.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you. He was good friends with the Chalmerses, who were his neighbors until they bought the big house on the beach, and they visited him often during his illness. I&#x2019;ve known them most of my life.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;All right, let&#x2019;s get to the pursuit part.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A week or so ago, I bought a lottery ticket, then forgot about it. Then I saw the winning number in the local paper, and I remembered I had one. I checked the numbers, and they matched. I called in at the lottery office in West Palm Beach, and this morning, after some days for them to investigate and see that I was who I said I was, I received the check. I also learned that, in Florida, there&#x2019;s a state law against concealing the identity of the winner. I&#x2019;ve quickly learned that a great many people have an untoward interest in lottery winners, thus the pursuit. They released my name early this morning, and when I left their office, I was surrounded by media people and others who had come to beg for money. I got out of there as quickly as I could, and when I turned on the car radio, I heard my name on the air. I drove to Palm Beach International Airport, where I had taken flying lessons, and somebody I know there found me a seat on an executive charter flight to Teterboro, for only five thousand dollars.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What kind of airplane?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A Gulfstream 450.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How did you do in the lottery?&#x201d;<br><br>Laurence reached into a pocket and handed Stone a crumpled envelope. &#x201c;There were two other winners, in Texas and Washington state, so I got only a third after they took out the taxes.&#x201d;<br><br>Stone opened the envelope wide enough to read the sum. &#x201c;Very nice,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;What are you going to do with it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There are some things I&#x2019;d like to buy, and Dicky thought you might advise me on how to invest the rest of it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What do you want to buy?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, I think I&#x2019;ll need some clothes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Good idea,&#x201d; Stone said drily.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, I know I&#x2019;m not appropriately dressed for the Upper East Side of New York. My good clothes are all in England and Palm Beach. I&#x2019;ll need some suits and jackets, I think.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Anything else?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Perhaps a car?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What sort of car?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A Porsche, perhaps.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Good choice.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, and I&#x2019;d like to buy a New York apartment.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That seems within your means, depending on the neighborhood,&#x201d; Stone observed. &#x201c;What sort of apartment did you have in mind?&#x201d;<br><br>Laurence produced a folded newspaper page and handed it to Stone. It was half a page from the real estate section of the previous Sunday&#x2019;s <i>New York Times</i>. &#x201c;This one,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, yes, I saw this. It&#x2019;s the penthouse of an old hotel on Park Avenue that has been remodeled and gone condo. Problem is, Laurence, the asking price for the apartment is twenty-two million dollars, but your check is for six hundred and twelve thousand. Do you have other means I&#x2019;m not aware of?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Perhaps you&#x2019;d better have another look at the check.&#x201d;<br><br>Stone removed the check from the envelope, read it, and gulped. <i>&#x201c;Six hundred and twelve million dollars?&#x201d;</i><br><br>&#x201c;You missed a few zeros the first time,&#x201d; Laurence said.<br><br>&#x201c;And this is a third of the prize?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It was the biggest Powerball ever.&#x201d;<br>2<br><br>Stone took another deep breath.<br><br>&#x201c;The limo driver from Teterboro this morning recognized me,&#x201d; Laurence said. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t go anywhere. It&#x2019;s crazy.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How long has this been going on?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Since this morning&#x2014;that&#x2019;s when I went to the lottery office.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I heard it mentioned on TV, but I didn&#x2019;t get the details.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It seems that a lot of other people did.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; Stone said, &#x201c;we&#x2019;ve covered the clothes, the car, and the apartment. What else do you have in mind?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Art and American antique furniture,&#x201d; Laurence replied. &#x201c;Dicky and Vanessa turned me on to that&#x2014;their house is full of it. There&#x2019;s a big show on at the Park Avenue Armory.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is that it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;For the moment. Oh, and I&#x2019;d like to write a nice check to Habitat for Humanity. I volunteered to help build half a dozen of their houses during my summers in Palm Beach.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Good. Here are the things I think you should do, starting tomorrow morning. First, we need to get that check into a bank, because every day you wait will cost you considerable income in interest. Then we need to get you introduced to some investment advisors. I&nbsp;want to introduce you to a young partner at my law firm, Woodman&nbsp;&amp; Weld. His name is Herb Fisher, and he will handle all the details of your plans. You will also need an accountant.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What bank do you recommend?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;M&amp;T Bank, which has a branch in my firm&#x2019;s building, and which owns an investment company called Wilmington Trust. They were, originally, the DuPont family bank, and they handle the investments of&nbsp;high-end clients. You certainly qualify as that. Also, they have a branch in North Palm Beach, and your accounts should be based there,&nbsp;in order to protect you from being taxed as a resident of New York State. It helps that you were born in Florida. Did your father own a home there?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, on Australian Avenue. It was his only home, and he had put it into a trust for me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Good. Another thing is, to protect your anonymity, we should set up a Florida corporation in which you can hold large assets, like your apartment. Think of a name for it.&#x201d;<br><br>Laurence thought about it. &#x201c;The LBH Corporation&#x2014;my initials?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Fine.&#x201d; Stone looked at his watch. &#x201c;We need to get you a disguise, in the form of some barbering, I think.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d;<br><br>He buzzed his secretary. &#x201c;Joan, see if Jos� at Nico&#x2019;s can take a new customer immediately&#x2014;haircut, shave, mani-pedi, facial. Book him in as Mr. Jones.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I need all of that?&#x201d; Laurence asked.<br><br>&#x201c;All of it. I&#x2019;m going to set up a viewing of your prospective apartment tomorrow, and you need to look as though you can afford it.&#x201d;<br><br>Joan buzzed. &#x201c;They can take Mr. Jones in fifteen minutes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Fine. Get Fred to drive him and wait for him. Laurence, do you have any other clothes?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got a blue blazer and some khakis.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where are they?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Right here, in my bag.&#x201d;<br><br>Stone held up the lottery check. &#x201c;And I think we should put this in my safe overnight.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Fine.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you have any cash?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;About seven thousand dollars. My father kept it in his safe. I used the rest to pay for the airplane ride.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s put six thousand of it in the safe, too. A thousand ought to get you through the next day or two.&#x201d;<br><br>Laurence opened his bag, a small duffel, and handed Stone a thick wad of money, secured with a rubber band. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got a thousand in my pocket.&#x201d; He went to change, and Stone opened his safe and secured the check and the cash.<br><br>Laurence came back looking more presentable. &#x201c;I think I&#x2019;m going to need a secretary. And I guess I should ask about your legal fees.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; Stone said, handing him a printed sheet of paper. &#x201c;This is a list of mine and my firm&#x2019;s legal fees. Please look it over when you have a chance.&#x201d;<br><br>Laurence scanned the document, folded it, and put it in his pocket. &#x201c;I can afford you,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;Good. I&#x2019;ll see what I can do about the secretary. Fred is waiting out front with the car. He&#x2019;ll bring you back when you&#x2019;re done at Nico&#x2019;s. You can leave your bag here.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I guess I&#x2019;ll need a hotel room, until I have an apartment.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You can bunk here. I&#x2019;ve got a lot of extra room.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Get going. I&#x2019;ll start setting up our day for tomorrow.&#x201d;<br><br>Laurence left and Stone called Herbie Fisher.<br><br>&#x201c;Herbert Fisher.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Stone. I have a new client for you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, who?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;One Laurence B. Hayward of Palm Beach, Florida.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What does Mr. Hayward do?&#x201d;<br><br>Stone thought about that. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s call him an investor, which he will be, starting tomorrow. And get us a meeting tomorrow morning at nine, nine-thirty, with Conrad Trilling at Wilmington Trust.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Can I mention Mr. Hayward&#x2019;s net worth?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s surprise him. Tell him to go ahead and set up a checking account.&#x201d; He gave Herbie Laurence&#x2019;s address in Palm Beach. &#x201c;The account should be at their North Palm Beach branch. Tell him we&#x2019;ll be making a large deposit, and ask him to call somebody at American Express and get Mr. Hayward a Centurion card instantly. He&#x2019;ll need a Visa card from the bank, too, and an ATM card. He&#x2019;s got a couple of hours before they close.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, anything else?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mr. Hayward is going to need a secretary. Anybody we can steal from the firm without putting anyone&#x2019;s nose out of joint?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Funny you should mention that. You remember that one of our senior partners died about three months ago?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Frank Penny?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Right. His secretary is Margery Mason. They&#x2019;ve kept her on to clean up Penny&#x2019;s affairs, and she&#x2019;s about done.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Dark hair, going gray, mid-forties, on the plump side?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the one, and they&#x2019;ve been slow to reassign her. The partners seem to go for the more fashionable-looking women.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s ideal. Talk to her, will you? Find out what she&#x2019;s making, so we can top it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Right.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, and set up a Florida company for Laurence called the LBH Corporation, to house some assets.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Right away.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He wants to buy an apartment in the old Fairleigh Hotel, on Park Avenue, that went condo. Get ahold of their prospectus and have a look at their standard contract. We should be ready for a quick closing, if he likes the place.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is he, by any chance, considering the one that was featured in the <i>Times </i>real estate section last Sunday?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How&#x2019;d you guess?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Magic. I hear the apartments have gone quickly, but they&#x2019;re having trouble moving that penthouse. Most of the apartments are two, three bedrooms and three or four to a floor, but the penthouse takes up the whole fifteenth floor. My advice is, haggle.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Absolutely. I&#x2019;ll have Mr. Hayward at Wilmington Trust at nine tomorrow morning. Meet us downstairs.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Will do. Are you going to tell <i>me</i> Mr. Hayward&#x2019;s net worth?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll surprise you, too. And he likes to be called Laurence.&#x201d;<br><br>Stone buzzed Joan. &#x201c;Please call Theresa Crane, a personal shopper at the Ralph Lauren store on Fifth Avenue at, what is it&#x2014;Fifty-fifth?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Close enough.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And set up an appointment for Laurence Hayward&#x201d;&#x2014;he spelled it for her&#x2014;&#x201c;at, say, ten-thirty am tomorrow.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Right. Anything else?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, be prepared for anything, and be prepared to handle it fast.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What else is new?&#x201d; she asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, and ask Helene to get the big guest room on three ready. We&#x2019;ll be dining tonight in my study.&#x201d;</p><h2>Driving Over Lemons: An Optimist in Spain</h2><p><p>&nbsp; No sooner had Chris Stewart set eyes on El Valero than he handed over a check.&nbsp; Now all he had to do was explain to Ana, his wife that they were the proud owners of an isolated sheep farm in the Alpujarra Mountains in Southern Spain.&nbsp; That was the easy part.<br><br>Lush with olive, lemon, and almond groves, the farm lacks a few essentials&#x2014;running water, electricity, an access road.&nbsp; And then there's the problem of rapacious Pedro Romero, the previous owner who refuses to leave.&nbsp; A perpetual optimist, whose skill as a sheepshearer provides an ideal entr�e into his new community, Stewart also&nbsp;possesses an unflappable spirit that, we soon learn, nothing can diminish.&nbsp; Wholly enchanted by the rugged terrain of the hillside and the people they meet along the way&#x2014;among them farmers, including the ever-resourceful Domingo, other expatriates and artists&#x2014;Chris and Ana Stewart build an enviable life, complete with a child and dogs, in a country far from home.</p></p><p>When English sheep shearer Chris Stewart (once a drummer for Genesis) bought an isolated farmhouse in the mountains outside of Granada, Spain, he was fully aware that it didn't have electricity, running water, or access to roads. But he had little idea of the headaches and hilarity that would follow (including scorpions, runaway sheep, and the former owner who won't budge). He also had no idea that his memoir about southern Spain would set a standard for literary travel writing. <p> This rip-roaringly funny book about seeking a place in an earthy community of peasants and shepherds gives a realistic sense of the hassles and rewards of foreign relocation. Part of its allure stems from the absence of rose-colored glasses, mainly Stewart's refusal to merely coo about the piece of heaven he's found or to portray all residents as angels. Stewart's hilarious and beautifully written passages are deep in their honest perceptions of the place and the sometimes xenophobic natives, whose reception of the newcomers ranges from warm to gruff.</p><p> After reading about struggles with dialects, animal husbandry, droughts, flooding, and such local rituals as pig slaughters and the rebuilding of bridges, you may not wish to live Chris Stewart's life. But you can't help but admire him and his wife, Ana, for digging out a niche in these far-flung mountains, for successfully befriending the denizens, and for so eloquently and comically telling the truth. The rich, vibrant, and unromanticized candor of <i>Driving over Lemons</i> makes it a laudable standout in a genre too often typified by laughable naivet�. <i>--Melissa Rossi</i></p>"Fortunately, there's no shortage of can-do Brits who are willing to tough it out for the enjoyment of readers everywhere. In fact, the ability to write hilarious travelogues featuring excruciating scenes of discomfort may well be a national characteristic. It's certainly possessed by Chris Stewart, the original drummer for the rock group Genesis, who bought a hovel in Southern Spain and then wrote the beguiling <b>Driving Over Lemons</b>."<br>-- <i>New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>"More than a travel book, this is a record of Stewart's slowly flourishing friendship with his neighbor, Domingo, and of how Stewart gradually sank roots deep into his beautiful Andalucian hillside....

He could ignore the pain in his head, the knives shredding his skull. He could ignore the cage he was in. He could even ignore the fact that sooner or later, he was going to slip up and his enemies would kill him. But he could not ignore the guilt and anger and frustration rising like a tidal wave in him as his men suffered the consequences of his decisions. </p><p> <i>Kaden, I can't reach Russell Cowlings. Can you?</i> </p><p> He had talked his men into the experiment that had landed them all in the laboratory cages in which they now resided. Good men. Loyal men. Men who had wanted to serve their country and people. </p><p> <i>We all made the decision. Kaden responded to his emotions, the words buzzing inside Ryland's mind. No one has managed to raise Russell.</i> </p><p> Ryland swore softly aloud as he swept a hand over his face, trying to wipe away the pain speaking telepathically with his men cost him. The telepathic link between them had grown stronger as they all worked to build it, but only a few of them could sustain it for any length of time. Ryland had to supply the bridge, and his brain, over time, balked at the enormity of such a burden. </p><p> <i>Don't touch the sleeping pills they gave you. Suspect any medication.</i> He glanced at the small white pill lying in plain sight on his end table. He'd like a lab analysis of the contents. Why hadn't Cowlings listened to him? Had Cowlings accepted the sleeping pill in the hopes of a brief respite? He had to get the men out. <i>We have no choice, we must treat this situation as if we were behind enemy lines</i>. Ryland took a deep breath, let it out slowly. He no longer felt he had a choice. He had already lost too many men. His decision would brand them as traitors, deserters, but it was the only way to save their lives. He had to find a way for his men to break out of the laboratory. </p><p> The colonel has betrayed us. We have no other choice but to escape. Gather information and support one another as best you can. Wait for my word.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p> He became aware of the disturbance around him, the dark waves of intense dislike bordering on hatred preceding the group nearing the cage where he was kept. </p><p> <i>Someone is approaching</i>. . . . Ryland abruptly cut off telepathic communication to those of his men he could reach. He remained motionless in the center of his cell, his every sense flaring out to identify the approaching individuals. It was a small group this time: Dr. Peter Whitney, Colonel Higgens, and a security guard. It amused Ryland that Whitney and Higgens insisted on an armed guard accompanying them despite the fact that he was locked behind both bars and a thick glass barrier. He was careful to keep his features expressionless as they neared his cage. </p><p> Ryland lifted his head, his steel gray eyes as cold as ice. Menacing. He didn't try to hide the danger he represented. They had created him, they had betrayed him, and he wanted them to be afraid. There was tremendous satisfaction in knowing they were . . . and that they had reason to be. </p><p> Dr. Peter Whitney led the small group. Whitney, liar, deceiver, monster maker. He was the creator of the GhostWalkers. Creator of what Captain Ryland Miller and his men had become. Ryland stood up slowly, a deliberate ripple of muscle-a lethal jungle cat stretching lazily, unsheathing claws as he waited inside his cage. </p><p> His icy gaze touched on their faces, lingered, made them uncomfortable. Graveyard eyes. Eyes of death. He projected the image deliberately, wanting, even needing them to fear for their lives. Colonel Higgens looked away, studied the cameras, the security, watched with evident apprehension as the thick barrier of glass slid away. Although Ryland remained caged behind heavy bars, Higgens was obviously uneasy without the barrier, uncertain just how powerful Ryland had become. Ryland steeled himself for the assault on his hearing, his emotions. The flood of unwanted information he couldn't control. The bombardment of thoughts and emotions. The disgusting depravity and avarice that lay behind the masks of those facing him. He kept his features carefully blank, giving nothing away, not wanting them to know what it cost him to shield his wide--open mind. </p><p> "Good morning, Captain Miller," Peter Whitney said pleasantly. "How are things this morning with you? Did you sleep at all?" </p><p> Ryland watched him without blinking, tempted to try to push through Whitney's barriers to discover the true character guarded behind the wall Whitney had in his mind. What secrets were hidden there? The one person Ryland needed to understand, to read, was protected by some natural or man--made barrier. None of the other men, not even Kaden, had managed to penetrate the scientist's mind. They couldn't get any pertinent data, shielded as Whitney was, but the heavy swamping waves of guilt were always broadcast loudly. </p><p> "No, I didn't sleep but I suspect you already know that." </p><p> Dr. Whitney nodded. "None of your men are taking their sleeping meds. I noticed you didn't either. Is there a reason for that, Captain Miller?" </p><p> The chaotic emotions of the group hit Ryland hard, as it always did. In the beginning, it used to drive him to his knees, the noise in his head so loud and aggravating his brain would rebel, punishing him for his unnatural abilities. Now he was much more disciplined. Oh, the pain was still there, like a thousand knives driving into his head at the first breach of his brain, but he hid the agony behind the fatade of icy, menacing calm. And he was, after all, well trained. His people never revealed weakness to the enemy. </p><p> "Self--preservation is always a good reason," he answered, fighting down the waves of weakness and pain from the battering of emotions. He kept his features totally expressionless, refusing to allow them to see the cost. </p><p> "What the hell does that mean?" Higgens demanded. "What are you accusing us of now, Miller?" </p><p> The door to the laboratory had been left standing open, unusual for the security--conscious company, and a woman hurried through. "I'm sorry I'm late; the meeting went longer than expected!" </p><p> At once the painful assault of thoughts and emotions lessened, muted, leaving Ryland able to breathe normally. To think without pain. The relief was instant and unexpected. Ryland focused on her immediately, realizing she was somehow trapping the more acute emotions and holding them at bay, almost as if she were a magnet for them. And she wasn't just any woman. She was so beautiful, she took his breath away. Ryland could have sworn, when he looked at her, the ground shifted and moved under his feet. He glanced at Peter Whitney, caught the man observing his reactions to the woman's presence very closely. </p><p> At first Ryland was embarrassed that he had been caught staring at her. Then he realized Whitney knew the woman had some kind of psychic ability. She enhanced Ryland's abilities and cleared out the garbage of stray thoughts and emotions. Did Whitney know exactly what she did? The doctor was waiting for a reaction so Ryland refused to give him the satisfaction, keeping his expression totally blank. </p><p> "Captain Miller, I'd like to present my daughter, Lily Whitney. Dr. Lily Whitney." Peter's gaze never left Ryland's face. </p><p> "I've asked her to join us; I hope you don't mind." </p><p> The shock couldn't have been more complete. Peter Whitney's daughter? Ryland let out his breath slowly, shrugged his broad shoulders casually, another ripple of menace. He didn't feel casual. Everything inside of him stilled. Calmed. Reached. He studied the woman. Her eyes were incredible, but wary. Intelligent. Knowledgeable. As if she recognized him, too, in some elemental way. Her eyes were a deep startling blue, like the middle of a clear, fresh pool. A man could lose his mind, his freedom in eyes like hers. She was average height-not tall, but not exceedingly short. She had a woman's figure encased in a gray--green suit of some kind that managed to draw attention to every lush curve. She had walked with a decided limp, but when he looked her over for damage, he could see nothing to indicate injury. More than all of that, the moment he saw her face, the moment she entered the room, his soul seemed to reach for hers. To recognize hers. His breath stilled in his body and he could only stare at her. </p><p> She was looking back at him and he knew the sight wasn't very reassuring. At his best, he looked a warrior-at his worst, he looked a savage fighter. There was no way to soften his expression or lessen the scars on his face or shave off the dark stubble marring his stubborn jawline. He was stocky with a fighter's compact build, carrying most of his weight in his upper body, his chest and arms, his broad shoulders. His hair was thick and black, and it curled when it wasn't kept tight against his skull. </p><p> "Captain Miller." Her voice was soothing, gentle, pleasant. Sexy. A blend of smoke and heat that seared him right through his belly. "How nice to meet you. My father thought I might be of some use in the research. I haven't had much time to go over the data, but I'll be happy to try to help." </p><p> He had never reacted so forcefully to a voice before. The sound seemed to wrap him up in satin sheets, rubbing and caressing his skin until he felt himself break out in a sweat. The image was so vivid that for a moment he could only stare at her, imagining her naked body writhing with pleasure beneath his. In the midst of his struggle to survive, his physical reaction to her was shocking. </p><p> Color crept up her neck, delicately tinged her cheeks. Her long lashes fluttered, drifted down, and she looked away from him to her father. "This room is very exposed. Who came up with the design? I would think it would be a difficult way to live, even for a short period." </p><p> "You mean like a lab rat?" Ryland asked softly, deliberately, not wanting any of them to think they were fooling him by bringing in the woman. "Because that's what I am. Dr. Whitney has his own human rats to play with." Lily's dark gaze jumped to his face. One eyebrow shot up. "I'm sorry, Captain Miller, was I misinformed, or did you agree to volunteer for this assignment?" There was a small challenge in her voice. </p><p> "Captain Miller volunteered, Lily," Peter Whitney said. "He was unprepared for the brutal results, as was I. I've been searching for a way to reverse the process but so far, everything I've tried has failed." </p><p> "I don't believe that's the proper way to handle this," Colonel Higgens snapped. He glared at Peter Whitney, his bushy brows drawing together in a frown of disapproval. "Captain Miller is a soldier. He volunteered for this mission and I must insist he carry it out to its conclusion. We don't need the process reversed, we need it perfected." </p><p> Ryland had no trouble reading the colonel's emotions. The man didn't want Lily Whitney anywhere near Ryland or his men. He wanted Ryland taken out behind the laboratories and shot. Better yet, dissected so they could all see what was going on in his brain. Colonel Higgens was afraid of Ryland Miller and the other men in the paranormal unit. Anything he feared, Higgens destroyed. </p><p> "Colonel Higgens, I don't think you fully understand what these men are going through, what is happening to their brains." Dr. Whitney was pursuing what was obviously a long--standing argument between them. "We've already lost several men. . . ." </p><p> "They knew the risks," Higgens retorted, glowering at Miller. "This is an important experiment. We need these men to perform. The loss of a few men, while tragic, is an acceptable loss considering the importance of what these men can do." Ryland didn't look at Higgens. He kept his glittering gaze fixed on Lily Whitney. But his entire mind reached out. Took hold. Closed like a vise. </p><p> Lily's head snapped up. She gasped out a soft protest. Her gaze dropped to Ryland's hands. She watched his fingers slowly begin to curl as if around a thick throat. She shook her head, a slight protest. </p><p> Higgens coughed. A barking grunt. His mouth hung open as he gasped for air. Peter Whitney and the young guard both reached for the colonel, trying to open his stiff shirt collar, trying to help him breathe. The colonel staggered, was caught and lowered to the floor by the scientist. </p><p> <i>Stop it.</i> The voice in Ryland's mind was soft. </p><p> Ryland's dark brow shot up and his gleaming gaze met Lily's. The doctor's daughter was definitely telepathic. She was calm about it, her gaze steady on his, not in the least intimidated by the danger emanating from him. She appeared as cool as ice. </p><p> <i>He's willing to sacrifice every one of my men. They aren't expendable.</i> He was just as calm, not for a moment relenting. </p><p> <i>He's a moron. No one is willing to sacrifice the men; no one considers them expendable; and he isn't worth branding yourself a murderer.</i> </p><p> Ryland allowed his breath to escape in a soft, controlled stream, clearing his lungs, clearing his mind. Deliberately he turned his back on the writhing man and paced across the cell, his fingers slowly uncurling. </p><p> Higgens went into a fit of coughing, tears swimming in his eyes. He pointed a shaky finger toward Ryland. "He tried to kill me, you all saw it." </p><p> Peter Whitney sighed and walked with heavy footsteps across the room to stare at the computer. "I'm tired of the melodrama, Colonel. There is always a jump on the sensors in the computers when there is a surge of power. There's nothing here at all. Miller is safely locked in a cage; he didn't do anything at all. Either you're trying to sabotage my project or you have a personal vendetta against Captain Miller. In any case, I'm going to write to the general and insist they send another liaison." </p><p> Colonel Higgens swore again. "I'll have no more talk about reversing the process, Whitney, and you know what I think about bringing your daughter on board. We don't need another damn bleeding heart on this project-we need results." "My security clearance, Colonel Higgens, is of the highest level and so is my commitment to this project. I don't have the necessary data at this time, but I can assure you I'll put in whatever time is necessary to find the answers needed." Even as she spoke, Lily was looking at the computer screen. </p><p> Ryland could read her thoughts. Whatever was on the screen puzzled her as much as what her father was saying, but she was willing to cover for him. She was making it up as she went along. As calm and as cool as ever. He couldn't remember the last time he had smiled, but the impulse was there. He kept his back to the group, not certain he could keep a straight face while she lied to the colonel. Lily Whitney had no idea what was going on; her father had given her very little information and she was simply winging it. Her dislike of Higgens, compounded by her father's unusual behavior, had put her firmly in Ryland's camp for the moment. </p><p> He had no idea what Peter Whitney's game was, but the man was buried deep in the mire.

Her best-known book, <em>Mysticism</em>, was widely read in the first half of the twentieth century and her work continues to have great impact on the theology of contemporary spiritual writers, such as Richard Rohr. Between 1924 and 1938, Evelyn Underhill compiled two personal prayer books for use when conducting spiritual retreats at Pleshey (the retreat house for the diocese of Chelmsford). The prayers were carefully selected and include quotes from a variety of theologians and writers in Christian spirituality, as well as her own very rich, metaphorical, and theologically deep prayers. This volume makes these collections available for the first time.</p><p>Evelyn Underhill (1875-1941) was an English Anglo-Catholic writer and pacifist known for her numerous works on religion and spiritual practice, in particular Christian mysticism.For those who love Evelyn Underhill and her many writings this Prayer Book is a real find! Here in this handsomely produced book is her compilation of prayers from the saints, theologians, liturgical texts, and her own prayers. These served as a resource in her work as a pioneering retreat leader and spiritual director. Reading these prayers puts the reader in the company of a woman of profound wisdom and deep prayerfulness. Her love of God and care for others is palpable.&#39;, Dana Greene, President, The Evelyn Underhill Association &#39;. . . the slim Foreword by Eugene Peterson is a fine pointer to the banquet of a read that Robyn has so well prepared on the finest of tables - she has served Underhill well and wisely.&#39;, Ron Dart, Clarion Journal of Spirituality and Justice &#39;Carefully edited, this beautiful little volume is a rare gem . . . highly recommended for anyone seeking new inspiration in prayer.&#39;, The Reader &#39;&#39;. . . will appeal to those who want a manual for their own devotions, and who recognise this as an anthology crafted by a spiritual master . . .

It was therefore tremendously exciting to discover her handwritten collection of prayers. This book now makes those prayers available to everyone. To read them and to pray them though is to enter into the heart and experience the spirituality of one of the most significant Christian writers of the 20th century.&#39;, Stephen Cottrell, Bishop of Chelmsford</p><h2>The Heretic Queen: Heiress of Misfortune, Pharaoh&#39;s Beloved</h2><p><b>In ancient Egypt, a forgotten princess must overcome her family&#x2019;s past and remake history.</b><br><br> The winds of change are blowing through Thebes. A devastating palace fire has killed the Eighteenth Dynasty&#x2019;s royal family&#x2014;all with the exception of Nefertari, the niece of the reviled former queen, Nefertiti. The girl&#x2019;s deceased family has been branded as heretical, and no one in Egypt will speak their names. <br><br>A relic of a previous reign, Nefertari is pushed aside, an unimportant princess left to run wild in the palace.

Although Paser was my tutor and couldn&#x2019;t tell a princess what to do, there would be extra lines to copy if I didn&#x2019;t obey. I stopped shifting in my beaded dress and stood obediently with the other children of Pharaoh Seti&#x2019;s harem. But at thirteen years old, I was always impatient. Besides, all I could see was the gilded belt of the woman in front of me. Heavy sweat stained her white linen, trickling down her neck from beneath her wig. As soon as Ramesses passed in the royal procession, the court would be able to escape the heat and follow him into the cool shade of the temple. But the procession was moving terribly slow. I looked up at Paser, who was searching for an open path to the front of the crowd.<br><br>&#x201c;Will Ramesses stop studying with us now that he&#x2019;s to become coregent?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Paser said distractedly. He took my arm and pushed our way through the sea of bodies. &#x201c;Make way for the princess Nefertari! Make way!&#x201d; Women with children stepped aside until we were standing at the very edge of the roadway. All along the Avenue of Sphinxes, tall pots of incense smoked and burned, filling the air with the sacred scent of kyphi that would make this, above all days, an auspicious one. The brassy sound of trumpets filled the avenue, and Paser pushed me forward. &#x201c;The prince is coming!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I see the prince every day,&#x201d; I said sullenly. Ramesses was the only son of Pharaoh Seti, and now that he had turned seventeen, he would be leaving his childhood behind. There would be no more studying with him in the edduba, or hunting together in the afternoons. His coronation held no interest for me then, but when he came into view, even I caught my breath. From the wide lapis collar around his neck to the golden cuffs around his ankles and wrists, he was covered in jewels. His red hair shone like copper in the sun, and a heavy sword hung at his waist. Thousands of Egyptians surged forward to see, and as Ramesses strode past in the procession, I reached forward to tug at his hair. Although Paser inhaled sharply, Pharaoh Seti laughed, and the entire procession came to a halt.<br><br>&#x201c;Little Nefertari.&#x201d; Pharaoh patted my head.<br><br>&#x201c;Little?&#x201d; I puffed out my chest. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not little.&#x201d; I was thirteen, and in a month I&#x2019;d be fourteen.<br><br>Pharaoh Seti chuckled at my obstinacy. &#x201c;Little only in stature then,&#x201d; he promised. &#x201c;And where is that determined nurse of yours?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Merit? In the palace, preparing for the feast.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, tell Merit I want to see her in the Great Hall tonight. We must teach her to smile as beautifully as you do.&#x201d; He pinched my cheeks, and the procession continued into the cool recesses of the temple.<br><br>&#x201c;Stay close to me,&#x201d; Paser ordered.<br><br>&#x201c;Why? You&#x2019;ve never minded where I&#x2019;ve gone before.&#x201d;<br><br>We were swept into the temple with the rest of the court, and at last, the heavy heat of the day was shut out. In the dimly lit corridors a priest dressed in the long white robes of Amun guided us swiftly to the inner sanctum. I pressed my palm against the cool slabs of stone where images of the gods had been carved and painted. Their faces were frozen in expressions of joy, as if they were happy to see that we&#x2019;d come.<br><br>&#x201c;Be careful of the paintings,&#x201d; Paser warned sharply.<br><br>&#x201c;Where are we going?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;To the inner sanctum.&#x201d;<br><br>The passage widened into a vaulted chamber, and a murmur of surprise passed through the crowd. Granite columns soared up into the gloom, and the blue tiled roof had been inlaid with silver to imitate the night&#x2019;s glittering sky. On a painted dais, a group of Amun priests were waiting, and I thought with sadness that once Ramesses was coregent, he would never be a carefree prince in the marshes again. But there were still the other children from the edduba, and I searched the crowded room for a friend.<br><br>&#x201c;Asha!&#x201d; I beckoned, and when he saw me with our tutor, he threaded his way over. As usual, his black hair was bound tightly in a braid; whenever we hunted it trailed behind him like a whip. Although his arrow was often the one that brought down the bull, he was never the first to approach the kill, prompting Pharaoh to call him Asha the Cautious. But as Asha was cautious, Ramesses was impulsive. In the hunt, he was always charging ahead, even on the most dangerous roads, and his own father called him Ramesses the Rash. Of course, this was a private joke between them, and no one but Pharaoh Seti ever called him that. I smiled a greeting at Asha, but the look Paser gave him was not so welcoming.<br><br>&#x201c;Why aren&#x2019;t you standing with the prince on the dais?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But the ceremony won&#x2019;t begin until the call of the trumpets,&#x201d; Asha explained. When Paser sighed, Asha turned to me. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the matter? Aren&#x2019;t you excited?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How can I be excited,&#x201d; I demanded, &#x201c;when Ramesses will spend all his time in the Audience Chamber, and in less than a year you&#x2019;ll be leaving for the army?&#x201d;<br><br>Asha shifted uncomfortably in his leather pectoral. &#x201c;Actually, if I&#x2019;m to be a general,&#x201d; he explained, &#x201c;my training must begin this month.&#x201d; The trumpets blared, and when I opened my mouth to protest, he turned. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s time!&#x201d; Then his long braid disappeared into the crowd. A great hush fell over the temple, and I looked up at Paser, who avoided my gaze.<br><br>&#x201c;What is she doing here?&#x201d; someone hissed, and I knew without turning that the woman was speaking about me. &#x201c;She&#x2019;ll bring nothing but bad luck on this day.&#x201d;<br><br>Paser looked down at me, and as the priests began their hymns to Amun, I pretended not to have heard the woman&#x2019;s whispers. Instead, I watched as the High Priest Rahotep emerged from the shadows. A leopard&#x2019;s pelt hung from his shoulders, and as he slowly ascended the dais, the children next to me averted their gaze. His face appeared frozen, like a mask that never stops grinning, and his left eye was still red as a carnelian stone. Heavy clouds of incense filled the inner sanctum, but Rahotep appeared immune to the smoke. He lifted the hedjet crown in his hands, and without blinking, placed it on top of Ramesses&#x2019;s golden brow. &#x201c;May the great god Amun embrace Ramesses the Second, for now he is Pharaoh of Upper Egypt.&#x201d;<br><br>While the court erupted into wild cheers, I felt my heart sink. I fanned away the acrid scent of perfume from under women&#x2019;s arms, and children with ivory clappers beat them together in a noise that filled the entire chamber. Seti, who was now only ruler of Lower Egypt, smiled widely. Then hundreds of courtiers began to move, crushing me between their belted waists.<br><br>&#x201c;Come. We&#x2019;re leaving for the palace!&#x201d; Paser shouted.<br><br>I glanced behind me. &#x201c;What about Asha?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He will have to find you later.&#x201d;<br>Dignitaries from every kingdom in the world came to the palace of Malkata to celebrate Ramesses&#x2019;s coronation. I stood at the entrance to the Great Hall, where the court took its dinner every night, and admired the glow of a thousand oil lamps as they cast their light across the polished tiles. The chamber was filled with men and women dressed in their finest kilts and beaded gowns.<br><br>&#x201c;Have you ever seen so many people?&#x201d;<br><br>I turned. &#x201c;Asha!&#x201d; I exclaimed. &#x201c;Where have you been?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My father wanted me in the stables to prepare&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;For your time in the military?&#x201d; I crossed my arms, and when Asha saw that I was truly upset, he smiled disarmingly.<br><br>&#x201c;But I&#x2019;m here with you now.&#x201d; He took my arm and led me into the hall. &#x201c;Have you seen the emissaries who have arrived? I&#x2019;ll bet you could speak with any one of them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t speak Shasu,&#x201d; I said, to be contrary.<br><br>&#x201c;But every other language! You could be a vizier if you weren&#x2019;t a girl.&#x201d; He glanced across the hall and pointed. &#x201c;Look!&#x201d;<br><br>I followed his gaze to Pharaoh Seti and Queen Tuya on the royal dais. The queen never went anywhere without Adjo, and the black-and-white dog rested his tapered head on her lap. Although her iwiw had been bred for hunting hare in the marshes, the farthest he ever walked was from his feathered cushion to his water bowl. Now that Ramesses was Pharaoh of Upper Egypt, a third throne had been placed next to his mother.<br><br>&#x201c;So Ramesses will be seated off with his parents,&#x201d; I said glumly. He had always eaten with me beneath the dais, at the long table filled with the most important members of the court. And now that his chair had been removed, I could see that my own had been placed next to Woserit, the High Priestess of Hathor. Asha saw this as well and shook his head.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s too bad you can&#x2019;t sit with me. What will you ever talk about with Woserit?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nothing, I suspect.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;At least they&#x2019;ve placed you across from Henuttawy. Do you think she might speak with you now?&#x201d;<br><br>All of Thebes was fascinated with Henuttawy, not because she was one of Pharaoh Seti&#x2019;s two younger sisters, but because there was no one in Egypt with such mesmerizing beauty. Her lips were carefully painted to match the red robes of the goddess Isis, and only the High Priestess was allowed to wear that vivid color. As a child of seven I had been fascinated by the way her cloak swirled around her sandals, like water moving gently across the prow of a ship. I had thought at the time that she was the most beautiful woman I would ever see, and tonight I could see that I was still correct. Yet even though we had eaten together at the same table for as long as I could remember, I couldn&#x2019;t recall a single instance when she had spoken to me. I sighed. &#x201c;I doubt it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, Nefer.&#x201d; Asha patted my shoulder the way an older brother might have. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;ll make friends.&#x201d;<br><br>He crossed the hall, and I watched him greet his father at the generals&#x2019; table. Soon, I thought, he&#x2019;ll be one of those men, wearing his braided hair in a small loop at the back of his neck, never going anywhere without his sword. When Asha said something to make his father laugh, I thought of my mother, Queen Mutnodjmet. If she had survived, this would have been her court, filled with her friends, and viziers, and laughter. Women would never dare to whisper about me, for instead of being a spare princess, I&#x2019;d be the princess.<br><br>I took my place next to Woserit, and a prince from Hatti smiled across at me. The three long braids that only Hittites wore fell down his back, and as the guest of honor, his chair had been placed to the right of Henuttawy. Yet no one had remembered the Hittite custom of offering bread to the most important guest first. I took the untouched bowl and passed it to him.<br><br>He was about to thank me when Henuttawy placed her slender hand on his arm and announced, &#x201c;The court of Egypt is honored to host the prince of Hatti as a guest at my nephew&#x2019;s coronation.&#x201d;<br><br>The viziers, along with everyone at the table, raised their cups, and when the prince made a slow reply in Hittite, Henuttawy laughed. But what the prince said hadn&#x2019;t been funny. His eyes searched the table for help, and when no one came to his aid, he looked at me.<br><br>&#x201c;He is saying that although this is a happy day,&#x201d; I translated, &#x201c;he hopes that Pharaoh Seti will live for many years and not leave the throne of Lower Egypt to Ramesses too soon.&#x201d;<br><br>Henuttawy paled, and at once I saw that I was wrong to have spoken.<br><br>&#x201c;Intelligent girl,&#x201d; the prince said in broken Egyptian.<br><br>But Henuttawy narrowed her eyes. &#x201c;Intelligent? Even a parrot can learn to imitate.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Come, Priestess. Nefertari is quite clever,&#x201d; Vizier Anemro offered. &#x201c;No one else remembered to pass bread to the prince when he came to the table.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course she remembered,&#x201d; Henuttawy said sharply. &#x201c;She proba- bly learned it from her aunt. If I recall, the Heretic Queen liked the Hittites so much she invited them to Amarna where they brought us the plague. I&#x2019;m surprised our brother even allows her to sit among us.&#x201d;<br><br>Woserit frowned. &#x201c;That was a long time ago. Nefertari can&#x2019;t help who her aunt was.&#x201d; She turned to me. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not important,&#x201d; she said kindly.<br><br>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d; Henuttawy gloated. &#x201c;Then why else would Ramesses consider marrying Iset and not our princess?&#x201d; I lowered my cup, and Henuttawy continued. &#x201c;Of course, I have no idea what Nefertari will do if she&#x2019;s not to become a wife of Ramesses. Maybe you could take her in, Woserit.&#x201d; Henuttawy looked to her younger sister, the High Priestess of the cow goddess Hathor. &#x201c;I hear that your temple needs some good heifers.&#x201d;<br><br>A few of the courtiers at our table snickered, and Henuttawy looked at me the way a snake looks at its dinner.<br><br>Woserit cleared her throat. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know why our brother puts up with you.&#x201d;<br><br>Henuttawy held out her hand to the Hittite prince, and both of them stood to join the dancing. When the music began, Woserit leaned close to me. &#x201c;You must be careful around my sister now. Henuttawy has many powerful friends in the palace, and she can ruin you in Thebes if that&#x2019;s what she wishes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because I translated for the prince?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because Henuttawy has an interest in seeing Iset become Chief Wife, and there has been talk that this was a role Ramesses might ask you to fill. Given your past, I should say it&#x2019;s unlikely, but my sister would still be more than happy to see you disappear. If you want to continue to survive in this palace, Nefertari, I suggest you think where your place in it will be. Ramesses&#x2019;s childhood ended tonight, and your friend Asha will enter the military soon. What will you do? You were born a princess and your mother was a queen. But when your mother died, so did your place in this court. You have no one to guide you, and that&#x2019;s why you&#x2019;re allowed to run around wild, hunting with the boys and tugging Ramesses&#x2019;s hair.&#x201d;<br><br>I flushed. I had thought Woserit was on my side.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, Pharaoh Seti thinks it is cute,&#x201d; she admitted. &#x201c;And you are. But in two years that kind of behavior won&#x2019;t be so charming. And what will you do when you&#x2019;re twenty? Or thirty even? When the gold that you&#x2019;ve inherited is spent, who will support you? Hasn&#x2019;t Paser ever spoken about this?&#x201d;<br><br>I steadied my lip with my teeth. &#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br><br>Woserit raised her brows. &#x201c;None of your tutors?&#x201d;<br><br>I shook my head.<br><br>&#x201c;Then you still have much to learn, no matter how fluent your Hittite.&#x201d;<br>That evening, as I undressed for bed, my nurse remarked on my unusual silence.<br><br>&#x201c;What? Not practicing languages, my lady?&#x201d; She poured warm water from a pitcher into a bowl, then set out a cloth so I could wash my face.<br><br>&#x201c;What is the point of practicing?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;When will I use them? Viziers learn languages not spare princesses. And since a girl can&#x2019;t be a vizier . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Merit scraped a stool across the tiles and sat next to me. She studied my face in the polished bronze, and no nurse could have been more different from her charge. Her bones were large, whereas mine were small, and Ramesses liked to say that whenever she was angry her neck swelled beneath her chin like a fat pelican&#x2019;s pouch. She carried her weight in her hips and her breasts, whereas I had no hips and breasts at all. She had been my nurse from the time my mother had died in childbirth, and I loved her as if she were my own mawat. Now, her gaze softened as she guessed at my troubles. &#x201c;Ah.&#x201d; She sighed deeply. &#x201c;This is because Ramesses is going to marry Iset.&#x201d;<br><br>I glanced at her in the mirror. &#x201c;Then it&#x2019;s true?&#x201d;<br><br>She shrugged. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s been some talk in the palace.&#x201d; As she shifted her ample bottom on the stool, faience anklets jangled on her feet. &#x201c;Of course, I had hopes that he was going to marry you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Me?&#x201d; I thought of Woserit&#x2019;s words and stared at her. &#x201c;But why?&#x201d;<br><br>She took back my cloth and wrung it out in the bowl. &#x201c;Because you are the daughter of a queen, no matter your relationship to the Heretic and his wife.&#x201d; She was referring to Nefertit...</p><h2>What Belongs to You: A Novel</h2><p><p><b>Longlisted for the National Book Award in Fiction </b><b>� A Finalist for the PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction </b><b>� A Finalist for the Los Angeles Times Book Prize for Fiction </b><b>� A Finalist for the James Taite Black Prize for Fiction </b><b>� </b><b>A Finalist the Center for Fiction First Novel Prize</b> <b>� A Finalist for the Green Carnation Prize </b><b>� </b><b>A <i>New York Times</i> <i>Book Review</i> Editors&#x2019; Choice </b><b>� </b><b>A <i>Los Angeles Times</i> Bestseller</b><br><b></b><b></b><br><b>Named One of the Best Books of the Year by More Than Fifty Publications, Including: <i>The New Yorker, The Paris Review, The New York Times </i>(selected by Dwight Garner), <i>GQ, The Washington Post,</i> <i>Esquire, </i>NPR,<i> Slate, Vulture</i>, the<i> San Francisco Chronicle, The Guardian </i>(London)<i>, The Telegraph </i>(London), <i>The Evening Standard </i>(London),<i> The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Miami Herald, T</i><i>he Millions, BuzzFeed, The New Republic</i> (Best Debuts of the Year), <i>Kirkus Reviews</i>, and <i>Publishers Weekly </i>(One of the Ten Best Books of the Year)</b><br><b></b><b></b><br><b>"Garth Greenwell's <i>What Belongs to You</i> appeared in early 2016, </b><b>and is a short first novel by a young writer; still, it was not easily surpassed by anything that appeared later in the year....It is not just first novelists who will be envious of Greenwell's achievement."</b><b>&#x2015;James Wood, <i>The New Yorker</i></b></p><p>On an unseasonably warm autumn day, an American teacher enters a public bathroom beneath Sofia&#x2019;s National Palace of Culture.

The eldest son of journalist Bill Moyers, William Cope Moyers relates with unforgettable clarity the story of how a young man with every advantage found himself spiraling into a love affair with crack cocaine that led him to the brink of death-and how a deep spirituality allowed him to conquer his shame, transform his life, and dedicate himself to changing America's politics of addiction.<br><br>"William Cope Moyers's lucid, measured tale of his own plunge into crack-addled hell [is] frightening in its very realism." -<i>USA Today</i></p><p><b>William Cope Moyers</b> is the vice president for external affairs at the Hazelden Foundation in Minnesota. He is a former newspaper journalist and writer for CNN.<br><br><b>Katherine Ketcham </b>has been writing nonfiction books for forty years. Her work has been published in sixteen foreign languages and has sold nearly one million copies. She founded and serves on the board of a grassroots nonprofit organization called Trilogy Recovery Community, which helps youth and their family members dealing with alcohol and other drug problems. Ketcham lives in Walla Walla, Washington.The prodigal son of Bill Moyers, the exemplary broadcast journalist, wrecked a bright career at CNN and deserted his family in 1994, hitting bottom as a "thirty-five-year-old crack addict." The lurid appeal of his story hinges largely on Moyers's munificent, even saintly father, and the train-wreck spectacle of his son's fall from grace. Moyers conveys with black humor the rapturous allure of substance abuse: "cocaine owned me, body and soul," he writes. It lures him back even after stints in rehab, brushes with death and lucky breaks. As his habit skids out of control, Moyers dodges punishment with smug hauteur. He enjoys plum reporting assignments as a fortunate son and plays the role of "solid, sincere recovering alcoholic," while persisting in his unrepentant behavior. Moyers hits his stride in evocations of his muddled, though quasi-methodical, mindset: the vertiginous pull of addiction, the powerful delusions of denial and the double-edged sword of legacy, which proves a potent enabler. His father, who addresses him in heartfelt letters excerpted at length, looms throughout as both reproving shadow and divine light.

These bold, black-and-white selections were chosen to address this issue. The pictures range from Patrick Caufield's <i>Duck</i>, a silhouette, to Bridget Riley's <i>Fragment 3</i>, a dizzying series of zigzags. There are also several simplified portraits, e.g., Julian Opie's <i>Natasha</i>, whose stylized hair suggests the carved surfaces of a woodcut. The images are glossy and slightly reflective, while the white pages have a matte finish&#x2014;another contrast. With a square trim size and heavy cardboard pages, the book could be enjoyed when propped on a changing table or crib or held by an adult. The last spread contains brief notes about infant vision, picture credits, and an envelope with 3 folded posters of the 12 scenes for nursery walls. Information about each artist has been placed on the back of the friezes. Libraries will want to consider whether these "consumables" are assets or deterrents, but babies won't care if they disappear. The variety of patterns offers an interesting alternative to the more traditional shapes found in Tana Hoban's classic <i>Black and White</i> (HarperCollins, 2007), now available in an accordion-fold format.

They represent the considered verdict of the Science Fiction Writers of America, those who have shaped the genre and who know, more intimately than anyone else, what the criteria for excellence in the field should be. The authors chosen for The Science Fiction Hall Fame are the men and women who have shaped the body and heart of modern science fiction; their brilliantly imaginative creations continue to inspire and astound new generations of writers and fans.</p><p>Robert Heinlein in "The Roads Must Roll" describes an industrial civilization of the future caught up in the deadly flaws of its own complexity. "Country of the Kind," by Damon Knight, is a frightening portrayal of biological mutation.

Selected by a vote of the membership of the Science Fiction Writers of America (SFWA), these 26 reprints represent the best, most important, and most influential stories and authors in the field. The contributors are a Who's Who of classic SF, with every Golden Age giant included: Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury, Arthur C. Clarke, John W. Campbell, Robert A. Heinlein, Fritz Leiber, Cordwainer Smith, Theodore Sturgeon, and Roger Zelazny. Other contributors are less well known outside the core SF readership. Three of the contributors are famous for one story--but what stories!--Tom Godwin's pivotal hard-SF tale, "The Cold Equations"; Jerome Bixby's "It's a <i>Good</i> Life" (made only more infamous by the chilling <i>Twilight Zone</i> adaptation); and Daniel Keyes's "Flowers for Algernon" (brought to mainstream fame by the movie adaptation, <i>Charly</i>).<p> The collection has some minor but frustrating flaws. There are no contributor biographies, which is bad enough when the author is a giant; but it's especially sad for contributors who have become unjustly obscure. Each story's original publication date is in small print at the bottom of the first page. And neither this fine print nor the copyright page identifies the magazines in which the stories first appeared.</p><p> Prefaced by editor Robert Silverberg's introduction, which describes SFWA and details the selection process, <i>The Science Fiction Hall of Fame: Volume One, 1929-1964</i> is a wonderful book for the budding SF fan. Experienced SF readers should compare the table of contents to their library before making a purchase decision. Fans who contemplate giving this book to non-SF readers should bear in mind that, while several of the collected stories can measure up to classic mainstream literary stories, the less literarily-acceptable stories are weighted toward the front of the collection; adult mainstream-literature fans may not get very far into <i>The Science Fiction Hall of Fame: Volume One, 1929-1964</i>. <i>--Cynthia Ward</i></p><p><b>Robert Silverberg</b> is a past president of the Science Fiction Writers of America, has published stories in all of the major science fiction magazines, written numerous science fiction novels, and is considered one of the greatest authors in the field.

By the time she was in her early twenties, Bassey was a spoken word artist and traveling with HBO's Def Poetry Jam, channeling her life into art. But beneath the fa�ade of the confident performer, Bassey's mental health was in a precipitous decline, culminating in a breakdown that resulted in hospitalization and a diagnosis of Bipolar II.</p><p>In <em>I'm Telling the Truth, But I'm Lying</em>, Bassey Ikpi breaks open our understanding of mental health by giving us intimate access to her own. Exploring shame, confusion, medication, and family in the process, Bassey looks at how mental health impacts every aspect of our lives&#x2014;how we appear to others, and more importantly to ourselves&#x2014;and challenges our preconception about what it means to be "normal."&nbsp; Viscerally raw and honest, the result is an exploration of the stories we tell ourselves to make sense of who we are&#x2014;and the ways, as honest as we try to be, each of these stories can also be a lie.</p><p></p></p><p><p>Bassey Ikpi is a Nigerian-American writer, ex-poet, constant mental health advocate, underachieving overachiever and memoir procrastinator.

Like kudzu, symptoms blossom and lace themselves through Ikpi&#x2019;s accomplishments and griefs, strangulating her from life&#x2019;s sustenance (food, friends, sleep). Her vivid, heart-racing chapters on the living, breathing moments of bipolar, particularly &#x2018;This is What Happens,&#x2019; will be assigned in coursework for years to come. Bassey Ikpi&#x2019;s writing is a revelation, a thrill, devastating and uproarious, lively in its accurate depiction of the lack of boundaries between the terrible and the hilarious. <em>I&#x2019;m Telling the Truth </em>is a feat, and will soon be the favorite book of many.

These true stories will engulf you, wring your heart out, and fill your chest with light. The writing is blade-sharp, precise and evocative, brilliant and graceful as it articulates an embodiment that has been both misrepresented and left unseen in our culture for far too long. Bassey is a storyteller to her bones and it shows. Read this book. Tell everyone you know to read this book. You have no idea how many people out there need these words.&#x201d; (<strong>Akwaeke Emezi, author of <em>Freshwater</em></strong>)<br><br>&#x201c;Bassey Ikpi articulates the weightlessness and bodylessness of vulnerability and neuroses and depression with the ease of a fog sifting through the sky. <em>I&#x2019;m Telling the Truth, but I&#x2019;m Lying</em> will shatter you, sure. Probably. Definitely.

Her failure to produce a male heir, however, paved the way for her improbable rule as a cross-dressing king. At just over twenty, Hatshepsut out-maneuvered the mother of Thutmose III, the infant king, for a seat on the throne, and ascended to the rank of pharaoh.</p><p>Shrewdly operating the levers of power to emerge as Egypt's second female pharaoh, Hatshepsut was a master strategist, cloaking her political power plays in the veil of piety and sexual reinvention. She successfully negotiated a path from the royal nursery to the very pinnacle of authority, and her reign saw one of Ancient Egypt&#x2019;s most prolific building periods.</p><p>Constructing a rich narrative history using the artifacts that remain, noted Egyptologist Kara Cooney offers a remarkable interpretation of how Hatshepsut rapidly but methodically consolidated power&#x2014;and why she fell from public favor just as quickly. <i>The Woman Who Would Be King</i> traces the unconventional life of an almost-forgotten pharaoh and explores our complicated reactions to women in power.</p></p><p><p>KARA COONEY is an associate professor of Egyptian art and architecture at UCLA in the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Cultures. In 2005, she was co-curator of <i>Tutankhamun and the Golden Age of the Pharaohs </i>at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Cooney produced a comparative archaeology series entitled <i>Out of Egypt</i>, which aired on the Discovery Channel and is streaming on Netflix.</p>One<br><br>Divine Origins<br><br>The Nile, lifeblood of the world's first great civilization, flowed calmly outside her palace window. The inundation had receded, and she could see the farmers readying themselves in the predawn hour, milking their cows, getting their sacks of emmer and barley seed ready to cast upon the rich black earth. In a few hours, the air would fill with the sounds of men shouting, children laughing, and animals bleating as they ran behind the plows, treading upon the scattered seeds and driving them into the soil. But for now, the sun was yet to crest the horizon. There was still time before she would be called to awaken the god in the temple. The girl dismissed her handmaiden to have a moment of privacy for herself.<br><br>Hatshepsut was around sixteen years old, and her life's purpose was over. Her husband Aakheperenre Thutmose, Lord of the Two Lands, King of Upper and Lower Egypt, may he live, was gravely ill, despite his youth. He and Hatshepsut had failed to produce an heir. She had only one daughter, Nefrure, who was strong and healthy but just two years old--not old enough to marry, reproduce, or forge the alliances that princesses so often do. Hatshepsut herself was the daughter of the previous king and was married to her father's successor--her own younger brother. She now sat as the king's highest-ranking wife. Her bloodline was impeccable: daughter of the king, sister of the king, wife of the king. Her biggest failing was not giving birth to a son: the heir to the throne would not come from her.<br><br>Why had Amen-Re, the king of the gods, not blessed Egypt with a son of pure royal blood? Why had he only given Hatshepsut a daughter? A man could spread his seed and produce offspring in profusion. A woman's womb could give but one child a year. And Hatshepsut's womb had been blessed only with a girl--or at least Nefrure was the only child that had lived.<br><br>Her husband did have some boys in the royal nursery--but from other mothers. The kingship should always pass from father to son; however, these boys were mere babies. The king had only been on the throne for three short years, not long enough to sire a stable of healthy potential heirs. And worse than that, the mothers of these children were nothing more than Ornaments of the King--pretty young things brought in to arouse the king's pleasure, with faces and bodies that would excite even the most sickly of monarchs. These girls had no family connections of any importance. How could one of these women be elevated to King's Mother? The idea was insupportable.<br><br>Hatshepsut understood that she wielded great power as queen. Her husband had never been in good health. His kingship had never been expected, but his two elder brothers died before they could take the throne. Thus Thutmose was not trained for kingship as he should have been. When they married, it was Hatshepsut who advised her brother on which officials to trust, which families to avoid, and how to make his mark as a monarch. It still seemed to her as if he had been plucked from the royal nursery one day, called to be king, to his own horror as much as anyone else's. The heartbreaking death of one brother after another had brought the crown to young Thutmose and the queenship to Hatshepsut. From as far back as she could remember, Hatshepsut understood that she was training for a life of great power and influence. But now it was all over. With no direct connection to the next king, she would be shut out of worldly affairs, her life's journey confined within luxurious palace walls.<br><br>But Hatshepsut still walked the halls of power as the God's Wife of Amen. And she sensed that it might be difficult for people to support the claim of an infant to the crowns of the Two Lands. Would their subjects watch passively as a young prince without connections, the son of one of the King's Beauties, was propped up as king? Such a vulnerable monarch could only be maintained if Hatshepsut stood behind him as his regent and made the decisions; otherwise, all would be lost; her father's Thutmoside line would be broken after only two generations. Many great men of the court were emphasizing their connections back to the Ahmoside family--the kings who had ruled before her father--in an attempt to lay claim to the thrones of Upper and Lower Egypt; if the White and Red crowns passed to one of them instead of to a son of her brother, then all that her parents had entrusted to her would be lost. It would be a shameful end to her father's dynasty: dying out after only two Thutmoside kings--her father and her brother. Somehow she had to create the circumstances for a third Thutmoside king.<br><br>Hatshepsut was not only the King's Great Wife but also the God's Wife of Amen, and she understood how to use that position. She served as the most important priestess in all of Egypt and had been trained from childhood by Ahmes-Nefertari, the most revered and aged royal queen and priestess in the land. As Hatshepsut prepared for her duties at the temple, she decided to ask the god what to do. She would place the burden in his hands.<br><br>Somewhere beyond the palace, she heard the beating of drums and the shaking of sistra. It was time to awaken Amen.<br><br>Hatshepsut hurried into the temple of Ipet-Sut, the Chosen Place for the gods of Thebes, moving through a series of majestic plastered gateways, light-filled courtyards, cool columned halls, and dark, smoke-filled inner sanctuaries, to her own robing rooms. As was her daily custom, she bathed in the sacred lake within the temple walls; the dawn air chilled her flesh. Having been thus purified in preparation for the morning meal with the god, she was anointed with oils by her Divine Adoratrices and then dressed in a pure linen robe pleated with hundreds of folds pressed into the gauzy fabric. This particular morning was not a festival day, so the temple staff had to complete only the simplest of preparations, which included the slaughter of a bull for the god's meal of a few dozen courses of milk, cakes, breads, and meats. To Hatshepsut, this temple was a second home. She found comfort in the juxtaposition of its frenetic activity against a calm, divine presence. Frantic priests ran through their preparations in the outer rooms as she walked with her ladies deep into the very heart of the temple. The chanting and drumbeats now sounded more distant as she entered the small, dark, windowless sanctuary where Amen dwelled--a room filled with brightly painted relief whose low ceiling and close walls acted as a womb of rebirth for the god. Finally, she stood before the shrine of Amen himself; in the lamplight, gold and lapis gleamed through the incense smoke, a sight that never failed to set her heart pounding.<br><br>The First High Priest of Amen joined Hatshepsut in the sanctuary while the Second High Priest arranged the sacred texts and instruments. After all the offerings of food and drink were arrayed, the lower-ranked priest retreated from the sanctuary, wiping away his footprints as he backed out of the room. The next moments of the ritual involved waking the vulnerable god from his sleep of death. All but the most important priests waited outside in the offering hall, shaking their sistra and beating drums to calm the god and to keep danger at bay. Only Hatshepsut and the First High Priest were able to witness the god's visage and exposed body. The high priest was the first to approach the shrine of Amen. With cool and reverent hands, he removed veils covering the unknowable and hidden image. The fact that the Great God was an immobile statue of gold did not make him any less real.<br><br>Closing her eyes, Hatshepsut began the incantations to awaken the god, calling him to his meal. Shuffling behind her, the First High Priest burned wax figures of the enemies of Egypt, so that the sanctuary would be clear of any danger. All around them incense burned in profusion, narrowing her vision in the lamp-lit room to a tunnel with the god's image at the end. Hatshepsut then reached for her golden sistrum, ready to shake the sacred tambourine of Hathor to awaken the god.<br><br>As she chanted and shook the sistrum, she opened her linen robe, revealing her naked body to the Great God's eyes. Meanwhile, the high priest offered him food, starting with milk, because the newly awakened divinity was as weak as an infant, and then building up to great bloody cuts of freshly sacrificed beef as he gained strength. After the last course, Hatshepsut moved closer to the statue so that the god could complete his morning renewal. As the God's Wife of Amen, Hatshepsut was also known as the God's Hand, the instrument of his sexuality. Reverently, she took his phallus into her palm, allowing him to re-create himself through his own release. Outside the sanctuary, her Divine Adoratrices were chanting, their voices rising higher and faster with the urgency of the moment. She stood before his statue, opened her linen robe wide to reveal her young body, and chanted praise of Amen, King of All the Gods, Lord of the Thrones of the Two Lands, the Lord of All, until she felt his orgasm.<br><br>Her eyes were closed. Her head was dizzy from the incense, herbs, and chanting. She felt herself fall to the floor before him--something neither she nor the high priest expected. With her eyes closed and her head bowed down before his shrine, she began to talk to her sacred husband, the god Amen-Re. She told him of the king's great sickness and impending death. She told him that a young Horus had not yet been chosen, and that all the candidates were merely nestlings, puppies. She told him that she had served him faithfully and would do as he asked. But all of Egypt would soon be in mourning and silence. She needed to know what to do to maintain the Black Land and Amen's rule in it. She was young, but she could hold and keep power. She needed his guidance.<br><br>In return she received a revelation. He spoke to her. Amen-Re, Bull of His Mother, Sacred of Arm, told her that she was elemental to the plans in his mind: he had chosen her, Hatshepsut, to carry them out; he would reveal his instructions over time, so she must be always ready, listening. And he told her more, too, secrets of power and fearlessness that left her breathless and weeping.<br><br>And then the revelation was over. In silence and in secret, her voice shaking with emotion, she gave Amen a secret promise. She would be his instrument.<br>1. There are no texts from Hatshepsut's time--historical, administrative, religious, or otherwise--that betray openly expressed negative feelings toward the ruling king or political activities of officials. We do have veiled references from earlier Middle Kingdom literary texts that obliquely discuss the regicide of Amenemhat I, the instability of the times, and the royal family's inability to trust any of the courtiers and officials. See Miriam Lichtheim, Ancient Egyptian Literature, vol. 1, The Old and Middle Kingdoms (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1975), 135-38. Later legal texts will point toward another regicide, that of Ramses III in Dynasty 20, and the involvement of the royal harem. See Susan Redford, The Harem Conspiracy: The Murder of Ramesses III (DeKalb: Northern Illinois University Press, 2002). The Tale of Wenamen, a text from the end of Dynasty 20 that belongs to both the literary and historical genres, reveals the opinion that the Egyptian king had lost his power over foreign lands and even his own country. See Miriam Lichtheim, Ancient Egyptian Literature, vol. 2, The New Kingdom (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1976), 224-30.</p><h2>The End of Dieting: How to Live for Life (Eat for Life)</h2><p><p>In <em>The End of Dieting</em>, Joel Fuhrman M.D., a board&#x2013;certified family physician who specializes in preventing and reversing disease through nutritional and natural methods, and #1 <em>New York Times</em>&nbsp;bestselling author of<em> Eat to Live</em>, <em>Super Immunity</em> and <em>The</em> <em>End of Diabetes</em>, delivers a powerful paradigm-shifting book that shows us how and why we never need to diet again.</p><p>Fuhrman writes, "By reading this book, you will understand the key principles of the science of health, nutrition and weight loss.

Dr. Fuhrman lays out in full all the dietary and nutritional advice necessary to eat our way to a healthier and happier life.

Following her acceptance to Middlebury College in Vermont, she deferred enrollment for a year in order to live and study in Moscow. At Middlebury, she specialized in French and Russian literature. After receiving her BA, she moved to Maui, Hawaii, working every kind of odd job imaginable, from grant writing and making cr�pes to guiding horse trips. Currently she lives in Vermont, but really, you never know.She pedaled hard past the hay bales in the roundabout on Main Street, turned onto Daisy Lane and raced past the clapboard houses, where jack-o&#x2019;-lanterns grinned on every front porch. She aimed her bike to knock down a rotting gray rubber hand groping up out of the earth in the Steiners&#x2019; yard, turned again at Johnson Hill and climbed panting up the steep dirt road.<br><br> No one came after her. Well, why would they, Ollie thought. She was Off School Property.<br><br> Ollie let her bike coast down the other side of Johnson Hill. was good to be alone in the warm sunshine. The river ran silver to her right, chattering over rocks. The fire-colored trees shook their leaves down around her. It wasn&#x2019;t hot, exactly&#x2014;but warm for October. Just cool enough for jeans, but the sun was warm when you tilted your face to it.<br><br> The swimming hole was Ollie&#x2019;s favorite place. Not far from her house, it had a secret spot on a rock half-hidden by a waterfall. That spot was Ollie&#x2019;s, especially on fall days. After mid-September, she was the only one there. People didn&#x2019;t go to swimming holes once the weather turned chilly.<br> Other than her homework, Ollie was carrying Captain Blood by Rafael Sabatini, a broken-spined paperback that she&#x2019;d dug out of her dad&#x2019;s bookshelves. She mostly liked it. Peter Blood outsmarted everyone, which was a feature she liked in heroes, although she wished Peter were a girl, or the villain were a girl, or someone in the book besides his boat and his girlfriend (both named Arabella) were a girl. But at least the book had romance and high seas adventures and other absolutely not Evansburg things. Ollie liked that. Reading it meant going to a new place where she wasn&#x2019;t Olivia Adler at all.<br><br> Ollie braked her bike. The ground by the road was carpeted with scarlet leaves; sugar maples start losing their leaves before other trees. Ollie kept a running list in her head of sugar maples in Evansburg that didn&#x2019;t belong to anyone. When the sap ran, she and her mom would&#x2014;<br><br> Nope. No, they wouldn&#x2019;t. They could buy maple syrup.<br><br> The road that ran beside the swimming hole looked like any other stretch of road. A person just driving by wouldn&#x2019;t know the swimming hole was there. But, if you knew just where to look, a skinny dirt trail went from the road to the water. Ollie walked her bike down the trail. The trees seemed to close in around her. Above was a white-railed bridge. Below, the stream paused in its trip down the mountain. It spread out, grew deep and quiet enough for swimming. There was a cliff for jumping and plenty of hiding places for one girl and her book. Ollie hurried. She was eager go and read by the water and be alone.<br><br> The trees ended suddenly, and Ollie was standing on the bank of a cheerful brown swimming hole.<br> But, to her surprise, there was someone already there.<br><br> A slender woman, wearing jeans and flannel, stood at the edge of the water. Her jeans were nice, her flannel soft, but her boots were muddy and worn, the leather cracking across one heel.<br> The woman was sobbing.<br><br> Maybe Ollie&#x2019;s foot scuffed a rock, because the woman jerked upright and whirled around. Ollie gulped. The woman was pretty, with amber-honey hair. But she had circles under her eyes like purple thumbprints. Streaks of mascara had run down her face, like she&#x2019;d been crying for awhile.<br><br> &#x201c;Hello,&#x201d; The woman said, trying to smile. &#x201c;You surprised me.&#x201d; Her eyes looked&#x2014;stretched&#x2014;the way a dog looks, hiding under the bed during a thunderstorm. Her white-knuckled hands gripped a small, dark thing.<br><br> &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t mean to scare you,&#x201d; Ollie said cautiously.<br><br> Why are you crying? she wanted to ask. But it seemed impolite to ask that question to a grown-up, even if her face was streaked with the runoff from her tears.<br><br> The woman didn&#x2019;t reply; she darted a glance to the rocky path by the creek, then back to the water. Like she was looking out for something. Or someone.<br><br> Ollie felt a chill creep down her spine. She said, &#x201c;Are you okay?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Of course.&#x201d; The woman tried to smile again. Fail. The wind rustled the leaves. Ollie glanced behind her. Nothing.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine,&#x201d; repeated the woman. She turned the dark thing over in her hands. Then she said, in a rush, &#x201c;I just have to get rid of this. Put it in the water. And then&#x2014;&#x201d; The woman broke off.<br><br> Then? What then? The woman held the thing out over the water. Ollie saw that it was a small black book, the size of her spread-out hand, with a cloth cover, its pages stained deep yellow.<br><br> Her reaction was pure reflex. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t throw away a book!&#x201d; Ollie let go of her bike and jumped forward. Part of her wondered, Why would you come here to throw a book in the river? You can donate a book. There were donation boxes all over Evansburg.<br><br> &#x201c;I have to!&#x201d; snapped the woman, bringing Ollie up short. The woman went on, half to herself, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the bargain. Make the arrangements. Then give the book to the water.&#x201d; She gave Ollie a pleading look. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have a choice, you see.&#x201d;<br><br> Ollie tried to drag the conversation out of crazy town. &#x201c;You can donate a book if you don&#x2019;t want it,&#x201d; she said firmly. &#x201c;Or&#x2014;or give it to someone. Don&#x2019;t just throw it in the river.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I have to,&#x201d; said the woman again.<br><br> &#x201c;Have to drop a book in the river?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Before tomorrow,&#x201d; said the woman. Almost to herself, she whispered, &#x201c;Tomorrow&#x2019;s the day.&#x201d;<br><br> Ollie was nearly within arm&#x2019;s reach now. The woman smelled sour&#x2014;frightened. Ollie, completely at sea, decided to ignore the stranger elements of the conversation. Later, she would wish she hadn&#x2019;t. &#x201c;If you don&#x2019;t want that book, I&#x2019;ll take it,&#x201d; said Ollie. &#x201c;I like books.&#x201d;<br><br> The woman shook her head. &#x201c;He said water. Upstream. Where Lethe Creek runs out of the mountain. I&#x2019;m here. I&#x2019;m doing it!&#x201d; She shrieked the last sentence as though someone besides Ollie was listening. Ollie had to stop herself from looking behind her again.<br><br> &#x201c;Why?&#x201d; she asked. Little mouse feet crept up her spine.<br><br> &#x201c;Who knows?&#x201d; the woman whispered. &#x201c;Just his game, maybe. He enjoys what he does, you know, and that is why he&#x2019;s always smiling&#x2014;&#x201d; She smiled too, a joyless pumpkin-head grin.<br><br> Ollie nearly yelped. But instead, her hand darted up and she snatched the book. It felt old under her fingers, gritty with dust. Surprised at her own daring, Ollie hurriedly backed up.<br><br> The woman&#x2019;s face turned red. &#x201c;Give that back!&#x201d; A glob of spit hit Ollie in the cheek.<br><br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so,&#x201d; said Ollie. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t want it anyway.&#x201d; She was backing toward her bike, half expecting the woman to fling herself forward.<br><br> The woman was staring at Ollie as if really seeing her for the first time. &#x201c;Why&#x2014;?&#x201d; A horrified understanding dawned on her face that Ollie didn&#x2019;t understand. &#x201c;How old are you?&#x201d;<br><br> Ollie was still backing toward her bike. &#x201c;Twelve,&#x201d; she answered, by reflex. Almost there&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br><br> &#x201c;Twelve?&#x201d; the woman breathed. &#x201c;Twelve. Of course, twelve.&#x201d; Ollie couldn&#x2019;t tell if the woman were giggling or crying. Maybe both. &#x201c;Its his kind of joke&#x2014;&#x201d; She broke off, leaned forward to whisper. &#x201c;Listen to me, Twelve. I&#x2019;m going to tell you one thing, because I&#x2019;m not a bad person. I just didn&#x2019;t have a choice. I&#x2019;ll give you some advice, and you give me the book.&#x201d; She had her hand out, fingers crooked like claws.<br><br> Ollie, poised on the edge of flight, said, &#x201c;Tell me what?&#x201d; The stream rushed and rippled, but the harsh sounds of the woman breathing were louder than the water.<br><br> &#x201c;Avoid large places at night,&#x201d; the woman breathed. &#x201c;Keep to small.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Small?&#x201d; Ollie was torn between wanting to run and wanting to understand. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s it?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Small!&#x201d; shrieked the woman. &#x201c;Small spaces! Keep to small spaces or see what happens to you! Just see!&#x201d; She burst into wild laughter. The animatronic witch sitting outside the Brewsters&#x2019; next to a cauldron of dry ice laughed like that. &#x201c;Now give me that book!&#x201d; Her laughter turned into a whistling, shrieking sob; her hands reached out, snatching.<br><br> Ollie heaved the Schwinn around and fled with it up the trail from the creek. The woman&#x2019;s footsteps scraped behind. &#x201c;Come back!&#x201d; she panted. &#x201c;Come back!&#x201d;<br><br> Ollie was already on the main road, her leg thrown over the bike&#x2019;s saddle. She rode home as fast as she could, bent low over her handlebars, hair streaming in the wind, the book lying in her pocket like a secret.<br> <b>&nbsp;</b></p><h2>Partners in Prayer</h2><p><p>"John I believe God has called me?a layman?to disciple, encourage, and pray for pastors.

In it, the ancient Persian religious leader Zarathustra (or Zoroaster)&nbsp;serves as the voice for Friedrich Nietzsche's views, which include the introduction of the controversial doctrine of the <i>�bermensch,</i> or "superman." <br>Although later perverted by Nazi propagandists, the <i>�bermensch</i>&nbsp;was conceived by Nietzsche to designate the ultimate goal of human existence as the achievement of greatness of will and being. He was convinced that the individual, instead of resigning himself to the weakness of being human and worshipping perfection only possible in the&nbsp;next world (at least in the Christian view), should try to perfect himself during his earthly existence, and transcend the limitations of conventional morality. By doing so, the <i>�bermensch</i> would emerge victorious, standing in stark contrast to "the last man" &#x2014; an uncreative conformist and complacent hedonist who embodies Nietzsche's critique of modern civilization, morality, and the Christian religion. <br>Written in a passionate, quasi-biblical style, <i>Thus Spake Zarathustra</i> is daring in form and filled with provocative, thought-provoking concepts. Today, the work is regarded as a forerunner of modern existentialist thought, a book that has provoked and stimulated students of philosophy and literature for more than 100 years. <br></p><p>The German philospher that established modern psychology.<p><b>From Kathleen M. Higgins and Robert C. Solomon&#x2019;s Introduction to <i>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</i></b></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Friedrich Nietzsche published the first part of his <i>Also sprach Zarathustra</i> (<i>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</i>) in 1883, and it became his best-known book. He considered it his most important work, and toward the end of his life he immodestly described it in <i>Ecce Homo</i> (1908) as the greatest present&#x201d; that had been made to humanity so far. In the same book, he no less outrageously proclaims that it is not only the highest book there is . . . but it is also the <i>deepest</i>, born out of the innermost wealth of truth.&#x201d; So we should not be surprised to find that <i>Zarathustra</i> is an extremely enigmatic and often pretentious work and by no means easy to understand or to classify. It is not clearly philosophy, or poetry, or prophecy, or satire. Sometimes it seems to be all of the above. It is also difficult because it is filled with learned allegories and allusions to the Bible, Plato, Shakespeare, Goethe&#x2019;s <i>Faust</i>, Ludwig Feuerbach, Arthur Schopenhauer, Nietzsche&#x2019;s former friend Richard Wagner, and others references that might not be readily recognizable by most contemporary readers. <i>Zarathustra</i>&#x2019;s subtitle, A Book for All and None,&#x201d; also sounds like a challenge, if not a direct affront, suggesting that while anyone might pick it up and read it, no one can really understand it. In the then anxious world of modern Europe, already preparing for the calamities and traumas of the twentieth century, <i>Zarathustra</i> would find itself curiously at home.</p><p>The basic format of <i>Zarathustra</i> is familiar. It tells a story in biblical style. <i>Zarathustra</i> is an epic that resembles no other book so much as the New Testament, a work that Nietzsche, who had originally intended to enter the ministry (and whose father and grandfathers had all been ministers), knew very well. Like Jesus in the New Testament, the titular character of Nietzsche&#x2019;s book goes into solitude at the age of thirty and returns to humanity with a mission to share his wisdom with others, to challenge them to reform their lives. But like Jesus, Zarathustra is seriously misunderstood. The book thus chronicles the protagonist&#x2019;s efforts and wanderings, his coming to understand who he is and what he stands for, by way of his interactions with the various and often odd characters he meets along the way.</p><p>Nevertheless, there are obvious and dramatic differences between <i>Zarathustra</i> and the Gospels. To begin with, unlike Jesus, who returns from solitude after forty days, Zarathustra enjoys solitude for ten years before beginning his mission. And while the story of Jesus is completed with his death and resurrection, Zarathustra&#x2019;s story is never finished. Indeed, the book starts exactly as it begins, with Zarathustra&#x2019;s leaving his mountain cave and descending once again to humanity. While Jesus is presented as enlightened throughout his teaching mission, Zarathustra matures only gradually. His whole story can be understood as an instance of the popular German genre of <i>Bildungsroman</i> that is, a novel chronicling the education of its protagonist. Most important, the gospel&#x201d; that Zarathustra brings contrasts sharply with the teachings of Jesus. In Nietzsche&#x2019;s version, Zarathustra utterly rejects the distinction between good and evil, and with it the basic premise of Judeo-Christian morality. He also denounces the otherworldly&#x201d; outlook of Christianity, its emphasis on a better&#x201d; life beyond this one. Zarathustra&#x2019;s philosophy, summarized in a single phrase, is a celebration of what is this-worldly.&#x201d; It is a yes-saying&#x201d; to life, <i>this </i>life; for Zarathustra (like Nietzsche) thinks that there is no other. The combined allusions to and discrepancies from the New Testament in <i>Zarathustra</i> make it appropriate to think of it as a parody, although it should not be thought of just as satire, which ridicules its target. On the blasphemous side, however, Zarathustra is treated as a figure whose seriousness and importance are comparable to those of Jesus.</p><p>Many readers may not know that Nietzsche&#x2019;s titular character is a very important historical religious figure. Zarathustra, also known as Zoroaster, probably lived in the seventh century b.c.e. (possibly from 628 to 551). He was a Persian who founded his own religion. Zoroastrianism, in turn, had a profound influence on both Judaism and Christianity. Zarathustra remained a fantasy figure in the West for many centuries, long before his writings were translated in the eighteenth century. Central to the teachings of the historical Zarathustra was the idea that the world is a stage on which cosmic moral forces, the power of good and the powers of evil, fight it out for dominance over humanity. This conflict between good and evil is central to both Judaism and Christianity, and given Nietzsche&#x2019;s rejection of this dichotomy, it is highly significant as well as ironic<i> </i>that Nietzsche chose the supposed originator of that distinction as his central character and ostensibly as his spokesman. Nietzsche tells us in <i>Ecce Homo</i> that as the first to invent the opposition of good and evil, Zarathustra should be the first to recognize that it is a calamitous error,&#x201d; for he has more experience and is more truthful than any other thinker. Nietzsche&#x2019;s Zarathustra is the historical religious leader updated, offering insight into the modern world, as the original Zarathustra addressed the circumstances of his era.</p>One could argue that Nietzsche used his fictional Zarathustra much as Plato used his teacher, Socrates (who never wrote down his teachings), to express his own views. And given that Nietzsche had a doctorate in classical philology and taught the classics for many years, we should not be surprised to find that Nietzsche&#x2019;s book makes extensive references to Plato&#x2019;s dialogues and their hero. Socrates, along with Jesus, remained one of the focal points of Nietzsche&#x2019;s philosophy from his first book to his last. Socrates is a figure of profound importance to the Western tradition. In Nietzsche&#x2019;s first book, <i>Die Geburt der Trag�die</i> (1872; <i>The Birth of Tragedy</i>), he called Socrates the one vortex and turning-point&#x201d; of Western culture. In one of his last books, <i>Die G�tzen-D�mmerung</i> (1889; <i>Twilight of the Idols</i>), he devotes an entire chapter to The Problem of Socrates,&#x201d; which is nothing less than the problem of Western civilization as such. In his life, Socrates was a self-styled gadfly to his contemporaries, provoking them to question their basic beliefs, which for the most part they held just because others held them too. His unrelenting challenge to common morals and public authority ultimately led to his being convicted on trumped-up charges and executed. Nietzsche&#x2019;s Zarathustra is similarly devoted to challenging both common sense&#x201d; and the authority of tradition, and he similarly arouses hatred in those committed to them.</p><h2>...y no se lo trago la tierra / And The Earth Did Not Devour Him (Bilingual Edition) (Spanish and English Edition)</h2><p>This new edition of a classic novel about the migrant worker experience recounts the experiences of a Mexican-American community through the eyes of a young boy. Forced to leave their home in search of work, the migrants are exploited by farmers, shopkeepers, and even other Mexican Americans, and the boy must forge his identity in the face of exploitation, death and disease, constant moving, and conflicts with school officials.</p><p>"I tell you, God could care less about the poor. Tell me, why must we live here like this? What have we done to deserve this? You're so good and yet you suffer so much," a young boy tells his mother in Tomas Rivera's classic novel about the migrant worker experience. Outside the chicken coop that is their home, his father wails in pain from the unbearable cramps brought on by sunstroke after working in the hot fields. The young boy can't understand his parents' faith in a god that would impose such horrible suffering, poverty and injustice on innocent people. <p> Adapted into the award-winning film <i>]&#x20ac;]and the earth did not swallow him</i> and recipient of the first award for Chicano literature, the Premio Quinto Sol, in 1970, Rivera's masterpiece recounts the experiences of a Mexican-American community through the eyes of a young boy.

But instead of jail time, Cole is given another option: attend Circle Justice, an alternative program that sends juvenile offenders to a remote Alaskan Island to focus on changing their ways. Desperate to avoid prison, Cole fakes humility and agrees to go.</p><p>While there, Cole is mauled by a mysterious white bear and left for dead. Thoughts of his abusive parents, helpless Peter, and his own anger cause him to examine his actions and seek redemption&#x2014;from the spirit bear that attacked him, from his victims, and from himself. </p></p><p>Cole Matthews is angry. Angry, defiant, smug--in short, a bully. His anger has taken him too far this time, though. After beating up a ninth-grade classmate to the point of brain damage, Cole is facing a prison sentence. But then a Tlingit Indian parole officer named Garvey enters his life, offering an alternative called Circle Justice, based on Native American traditions, in which victim, offender, and community all work together to find a healing solution. Privately, Cole sneers at the concept, but he's no fool--if it gets him out of prison, he'll do anything. Ultimately, Cole ends up banished for one year to a remote Alaskan island, where his arrogance sets him directly in the path of a mysterious, legendary white bear. Mauled almost to death, Cole awaits his fate and begins the transition from anger to humility. <p> Ben Mikaelsen's depiction of a juvenile delinquent's metamorphosis into a caring, thinking individual is exciting and fascinating, if at times heavy-handed. Cole's nastiness and the vivid depictions of the lengths he must go to survive after the (equally vivid) attack by the bear are excruciating at times, but the concept of finding a way to heal a whole community when one individual wrongs another is compelling. The jacket cover photo of the author in a bear hug with the 700-pound black bear that he and his wife adopted and raised is definitely worth seeing! (Ages 12 and older) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p>Read by Lee Tergesen<br>Approx. 6 hours<br>4 cassettes<br><br>When he brutally attacks a classmate his punishment is an alternative path based on a Native American tradition called the Circle Justice. Banished to a remote Alaskan island, Cole's rage and isolation lead him to another brazen attack. This time, his intended victim is the Spirit Bear of Native American legend?and the clumsy assault ends with Cole mauled nearly to death. Rescuers arrive to save Cole's life, but it is the attack of the Spirit Bear that is the start of Cole's long journey to accepting responsibility for his life and saving his soul.<br></p><h2>Cookery and Dining in Imperial Rome</h2><p>This is the first English translation of <i>Apicius de re Coquinaria</i>, the oldest known cookbook in existence. It is also one of the few translations of this original Roman cookbook prepared by a professional chef. Joseph Vehling's brilliant translation, extended introduction, and full and helpful commentary combine to bring you a clear picture of what foods the Romans ate, how they prepared them, and the highly developed state of culinary arts in Imperial Rome.<br>There are recipes for cooking fish and seafood, game, chicken, pork, veal, and other domesticated animals and birds, for vegetable dishes, grains, beverages, and sauces; virtually the full range of cookery is covered. There are also methods for preserving foods, revitalizing them, even adulterating them. Some of the recipes are strikingly modern; others use ingredients and methods that have long since disappeared.<br>As the book was originally written for professional cooks working in Rome (perhaps made even more obscure to prevent amateurs from gaining access to the recipes), Joseph Vehling's generous notes are essential for understanding the ingredients and methods used in the recipes and the relationship of Roman cooking to our own traditions.<br>Besides the translation and notes there is much other material, both scholarly and informative, covering cooking in the ancient world, the history and bibliography of Apicius manuscripts and editions, an index and vocabulary of Roman cookery terms, 49 illustrations including drawings by the author and facsimiles from earlier editions, and much more. Needless to say, you couldn't find this information anywhere else.<br>This rare book will appeal to gourmets, professional and amateur chefs, cultural historians, and others who want to see, first hand, the foods on which Imperial Rome dined. It will clear up many myths about Roman cooking and will provide a great deal of enjoyable reading as well.</p><p>Text: English, Latin (translation)</p><h2>Game Changer!

Robb</b> is the pseudonym for a #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of more than 200 novels, including the bestselling In Death series. There are more than 500 million copies of her books in print.<b>Prologue</b><p>Pop quizzes were killers. like ambushing assassins they elicited fear and loathing in the prey, and a certain heady power in the hunter.</p><p>As Craig Foster prepared to take his lunch break and finish refining the quiz, he knew how his fifth-period U.S. history class would respond. Groans and gasps, winces of misery or panic. He understood completely. At twenty-six, he wasn&#x2019;t so far removed from the student section of the classroom to have forgotten the pain or the anxiety. </p><p>He got out his insulated lunch sack. Being a creature of habit, he knew that his wife&#x2014;and wasn&#x2019;t it just mag being married&#x2014;would have packed him a poultry pocket, an apple, some soy chips, and his favorite hot chocolate. </p><p>He never asked her to pack his lunch, or to make sure his socks were washed and folded in pairs and stacked in the right-hand side of his top drawer. But she said she liked doing things for him. The seven months they&#x2019;d been married had been the best of his life. And it hadn&#x2019;t sucked before that, either, he decided. </p><p>He had a job he loved, and was damn good at, he thought with a quick burst of pride. He and Lissette had a very decent apartment within reasonable walking distance of the school. His students were bright and interesting&#x2014;and, bonus time, they liked him. </p><p>They&#x2019;d grumble and sweat a bit over the pop quiz, but they&#x2019;d do fine. </p><p>Before he got down to work, he shot his bride an e-mail. </p><p>Hey, Lissy! How about I pick up that soup you like, and the big salad on the way home from work tonight? </p><p>Miss you. Love every sweet inch of you! </p><p>You know who. </p><p>It made him smile thinking about how it would make her smile. Then he switched back to the quiz. He studied his comp screen as he poured out the first cup of hot chocolate and lifted the pocket bread filled with soy products masquerading as thinly sliced turkey. </p><p>There was so much to teach; so much to learn. The history of the country was rich and diversified and dramatic, full of tragedy, comedy, romance, heroism, cowardice. He wanted to pass all of it on to his students, to make them see how the country, and the world they lived in, had evolved into what they were in the early months of 2060. </p><p>He ate, added questions, deleted others. And he drank deep of his favorite chocolate as a soft snow fell outside the classroom window. </p><p>As the days of his own short history ticked minute by minute closer to their end. </p><p>Schools gave her the willies. It was a humbling thing for a tough-minded, kick-ass cop to admit, even to herself. But there it was. Lieutenant Eve Dallas, arguably New York City&#x2019;s top murder cop, would rather have been stalking through an abandoned tenement in search of a psychotic chemi-head juiced on Zeus than striding down the pristine hallways of staunchly upper-middle-class Sarah Child Academy. </p><p>Despite the bright, primary colors along walls and floors, the sparkling glass of the windows, it was, for Eve, just another torture chamber. </p><p>Most of the doors along the maze were open, and the rooms beyond empty but for the desks, tables, counters, screens, boards. </p><p>Eve glanced over at Principal Arnette Mosebly, a sturdy, heading-�toward-statuesque woman of about fifty. Her mixed-race heritage had given her skin the color of caramel cream and eyes of misty blue. Her hair was a glossy black worn in a ball of corkscrew curls. She wore a long black skirt with a short red jacket. The heels of her sensible shoes clicked and clacked on the floor as they walked along the second-floor corridor. </p><p>&#x201c;Where are the kids?&#x201d; Eve asked. </p><p>&#x201c;I had them taken to the auditorium until their parents or guardians can pick them up. Most of the staff is there as well. I thought it best, and most respectful, to cancel afternoon classes.&#x201d; </p><p>She paused a few feet away from where a uniformed cop stood in front of a closed door. </p><p>&#x201c;Lieutenant, this is beyond tragic for us, and the children. Craig...&#x201d; She pressed her lips together, looked away. &#x201c;He was young and bright and enthusiastic. His whole life ahead of him, and&#x2014;&#x201d; She broke off, held up a hand as she struggled for composure. &#x201c;I understand this sort of thing, I mean to say, having the police involved is routine in matters like this. But I hope you&#x2019;ll be as discreet and efficient as it&#x2019;s possible to be. And that it will be possible for us to wait to&#x2014;to transport the body until after all the students have left the building.&#x201d; </p><p>Now she straightened her shoulders. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know how that young man could have become so ill. Why would he have come in today if he was feeling unwell? His wife7mdash;he&#x2019;s only been married a few months&#x2014;I haven&#x2019;t contacted her yet. I wasn&#x2019;t sure&#x2014;&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to want to leave that to us. If you&#x2019;ll give us a few moments.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Yes. Yes, of course.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Record on, Peabody,&#x201d; Eve said to her partner. She nodded to the guard who stepped to the side. </p><p>Eve opened the door, stood at the threshold. She was a tall, lanky woman with a choppy cap of brown hair, with brown eyes that were flat and dispassionate now as she scanned the scene. Her movements were easy as she took a can of Seal-It from her field kit, coated her hands, her boots. </p><p>In nearly a dozen years on the force, she&#x2019;d seen a lot worse than the doomed history teacher sprawled on the floor in pools of his own vomit and shit. </p><p>Eve noted the time and place for the record. &#x201c;MTs responded to the nine-one-one, arriving at fourteen-sixteen. Pronounced victim, identified as Foster, Craig, at fourteen-nineteen.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Lucky we drew a couple MTs on the call who knew better than to move the body,&#x201d; Peabody commented. &#x201c;Poor bastard.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Having lunch at his desk? Place like this probably runs to a staff lounge, cafeteria, whatever.&#x201d; Remaining at the threshold, Eve cocked her head. &#x201c;Knocked over a jumbo insulated bottle, the chair.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Looks more like a seizure than a struggle.&#x201d; Peabody skirted the edge of the room, her airboots squishing slightly. She checked the windows. &#x201c;Locked.&#x201d; She angled so she could study the desk, the body from that side of the room. </p><p>While her body was as sturdy as Arnette Mosebly&#x2019;s, Peabody&#x2019;s build would never be statuesque. Her dark hair had grown past the nape of her neck and curved up at the ends in a flirty little flip Eve had yet to resign herself to. </p><p>&#x201c;Working lunch,&#x201d; Peabody noted. &#x201c;Lesson plans or grading papers. Allergic reaction to something he ate, maybe.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Oh, yeah, I&#x2019;d say.&#x201d; Eve crossed to the body, hunkered down. She&#x2019;d run prints, do the standard gauge for TOD, all the rest, but for a moment she simply studied the dead. </p><p>Spider legs of broken vessels ran through the whites of his eyes. There were traces of foam as well as vomit clinging to his lips. &#x201c;Tried to crawl after it hit him,&#x201d; she murmured. &#x201c;Tried to crawl for the door. Get the formal ID, Peabody, verify TOD.&#x201d; </p><p> Rising, Eve moved carefully around the puddles of what Craig&#x2019;s body had voided, and picked up the insulated cup she saw, which had his name engraved in silver over black. Sniffed. </p><p>&#x201c;You think somebody poisoned this guy?&#x201d; Peabody asked. </p><p>&#x201c;Hot chocolate. And something else.&#x201d; Eve bagged the cup into evidence. &#x201c;Color of the vomit, signs indicating seizure, extreme distress. Yeah, I&#x2019;m thinking poison. ME will verify. We&#x2019;ll need to get clearance to access his medicals from the next of kin. Work the scene. I&#x2019;m going to talk to Mosebly again, and pull in the witnesses.&#x201d; </p><p>Eve stepped out again. Arnette Mosebly paced the hallway with a PPC in her hand. &#x201c;Principal Mosebly? I&#x2019;m going to have to ask you not to contact anyone, speak with anyone just yet.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Oh...I7mdash;actually, I was just&#x2014;&#x201d; She turned the PPC around so Eve could see the miniscreen. &#x201c;Word game. Something to occupy my mind for a bit. Lieutenant, I&#x2019;m worried about Lissette. Craig&#x2019;s wife. She needs to be told.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;She will be. Right now I&#x2019;d like to speak with you, in private. And I need to interview the students who found the body.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Rayleen Straffo and Melodie Branch. The officer who responded said they couldn&#x2019;t leave the building, and had to be separated.&#x201d; Her lips thinned now in obvious disapproval. &#x201c;Those girls were traumatized, Lieutenant. They were hysterical, as one would expect under these kinds of circumstances. I have Rayleen with the grief counselor, and Melodie with our nurse practitioner. Their parents should be with them by now.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;You notified their parents.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;You have your procedure, Lieutenant. I have mine.&#x201d; She gave one of those regal nods Eve imagined were required in Principal Training 101. &#x201c;My first priority is the health and safety of my students. These girls are ten years old, and they walk into that.&#x201d; She nodded toward the door. &#x201c;God knows what damage it&#x2019;s done to them, emotionally.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Craig Foster isn&#x2019;t feeling so well himself.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I have to do what needs to be done to protect my students. My school&#x2014;&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Right now, it&#x2019;s not your school. It&#x2019;s my crime scene.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Crime scene?&#x201d; Color drained from Arnette&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;What do you mean? What crime?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m going to find out. I want the witnesses brought in, one at a time. Your office is probably the best place for the interviews. One parent or guardian per child during the interview.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Very well, then. Come with me.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Officer?&#x201d; Eve looked over her shoulder. &#x201c;Tell Detective Peabody I&#x2019;m going to the principal&#x2019;s office.&#x201d; </p><p>His mouth twitched, very slightly. &#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d; </p><p><b>Chapter I</b></p><p>It was a different kettle altogether, Eve discovered, when you were the honcho instead of the one in the hot seat. Not that she&#x2019;d particularly been a discipline problem in her day, she remembered. Mostly, she&#x2019;d tried to be invisible, just get by, just get through and get out of the whole educational prison the day it was legal to do so. </p><p>But she hadn&#x2019;t always managed it. A smart mouth and a bad attitude had surfaced often enough to earn her a few trips down to that hot seat. </p><p>She was supposed to be grateful the state was providing her, a ward thereof, with an education, with a home, with enough food to sustain life. She was supposed to be grateful to have clothes on her back, even if someone else had worn them first. She was supposed to want to better herself, which had been tough when she hadn&#x2019;t remembered, not clearly, where she&#x2019;d come from in the first place. </p><p>What she remembered most were the smug-toned lectures, the disappointed frowns that didn&#x2019;t quite hide the superiority. </p><p>And the endless, the terminal, the all-pervasive boredom. </p><p>Of course, it hadn&#x2019;t been smart and spiffy private schools for her, with state-of-the-art educational equipment, sparkling clean classrooms, stylish uniforms, and a one-teacher-per-six-students ratio. </p><p>She&#x2019;d be willing to bet her next paycheck that the Sarah Child Academy didn&#x2019;t run to fist fights in the hallways, or homemade boomers in the lockers. </p><p>But today, at least, it ran to murder. </p><p>While she waited in Mosebly&#x2019;s office with its homey touches of live plants and stylish teapots, she did a quick run on the victim. </p><p>Foster, Craig, age twenty-six. No criminal. Both parents still living, she noted, and still married to each other. They lived in New Jersey, where Craig himself had been born and raised. He&#x2019;d attended Columbia on a partial scholarship, earned his teaching certificate, and was working on a master&#x2019;s degree in history. </p><p>He&#x2019;d married Bolviar, Lissette, in July of the previous year. </p><p>He looked fresh and eager in his ID photo, Eve mused. A handsome young man with a clear complexion the color of roasted chestnuts. Deep, dark eyes, and dark hair worn in what Eve thought they were calling a high-top. Shaved close on the sides and back, brushed high on the crown. </p><p>His shoes had been trendy, too, she recalled. Black and silver gels, with ankle wraps. Pricey. But his sports jacket had been dirt brown, worn at the cuffs. Decent wrist unit, which had struck her as a knockoff. And a shiny gold band on the third finger of his left hand. </p><p>She imagined, when Peabody completed the scene, there would be under fifty credits in Craig&#x2019;s pockets. </p><p>She made a few quick notes. </p><p>Where did the hot chocolate come from? </p><p>Who had access to the insulated cup? </p><p>Shared classroom? </p><p>Time line. Last to see vic alive, first to find body. </p><p>Insurance policies, death benefits? Beneficiaries? </p><p>She glanced up as the door opened. </p><p>&#x201c;Lieutenant?&#x201d; Mosebly stepped in, one hand on the shoulder of a young girl with milky skin dotted with freckles that went with her carrot-red hair. The hair was long and brushed back into a sleek tail. </p><p>She looked slight and shaky in her navy blazer and spotless khakis. </p><p>&#x201c;Melodie, this is Lieutenant Dallas, with the police. She needs to speak with you. Lieutenant Dallas, this is Melodie&#x2019;s mother, Angela Miles-Branch.&#x201d; </p><p>The kid had gotten the hair and skin from Mom, Eve noted. And Mom looked just as shaky. </p><p>&#x201c;Lieutenant, I wonder if this could possibly wait until tomorrow. I&#x2019;d prefer taking Melodie home now.&#x201d; Angela had Melodie&#x2019;s hand in a death grip. &#x201c;My daughter isn&#x2019;t feeling well. Understandably.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be easier all around if we do this now. It shouldn&#x2019;t take long. Principal Mosebly, if you&#x2019;ll excuse us.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I feel I should stay, as a representative of the school and as Melodie&#x2019;s advocate.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;A representative isn&#x2019;t required at this time, and the minor child&#x2019;s mother is present as her advocate. You&#x2019;ll need to step out.&#x201d; </p><p>There was an argument in Mosebly&#x2019;s eyes, but she tightened her jaw, stepped out of the room. </p><p>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you take a seat, Melodie?&#x201d; </p><p>Two fat tears, one for each big blue eye, spilled out. &#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am.

Mr. Vuong can create startling images (a black piano in a field, a wedding-cake couple preserved under glass, a shepherd stepping out of a Caravaggio painting) and make the silences and elisions in his verse speak as potently as his words There is a powerful emotional undertow to these poems that springs from Mr. Vuong&#x2019;s sincerity and candor, and from his ability to capture specific moments in time with both photographic clarity and a sense of the evanescence of all earthly things.&#x201d;</p><p> Reading Vuong is like watching a fish move: he manages the varied currents of English with muscled intuition. His poems are by turns graceful and wonderstruck. His lines are both long and short, his pose narrative and lyric, his diction formal and insouciant.

Since it was called Mexican food for most of its history, nobody even thought of it as American until about thirty years ago. That was when the first authoritative Mexican cookbook in the United States, Diana Kennedy's <i>The Cuisines of Mexico</i>, was published.<br><br>Kennedy trashed the "mixed plates" in "so-called Mexican restaurants" north of the border and encouraged readers to raise their standards. The English-born Kennedy was the wife of the late Paul Kennedy, a <i>New York Times</i> correspondent posted in Mexico City. She had never lived in the United States at the time of the book's publication in 1972 and evidently wasn't familiar with the Tejano culture.<br><br>Hugely popular in the United States, <i>The Cuisines of Mexico</i> was a breakthrough cookbook, one that could have been written only by a non-Mexican. It unified Mexican cooking by transcending Mexico's nasty class divisions and treating the food of the poor with the same respect as that of the upper classes. But while admirably egalitarian in her attitude toward the food of Mexicans, Kennedy lambasted the food of Texas-Mexicans.<br><br>In a later book, <i>The Art of Mexican Cooking</i>, Kennedy wrote, "Far too many people outside Mexico still think of them [Mexican foods] as an overly large platter of mixed messes, smothered with shrill tomato sauce, sour cream, and grated cheese preceded by a dish of mouth-searing sauce and greasy deep-fried chips. Although these do represent some of the basic foods of Mexico-in name only-they have been brought down to their lowest common denominator north of the border, on a par with the chop suey and chow mein of Chinese restaurants 20 years ago."<br><br>Tex-Mex entered the lexicon of the food world within a year of <i>The Cuisines of Mexico</i>'s publication. The first time it was used in print in relation to food, according to the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>, was in this 1973 quote from the <i>Mexico City News</i>, an English-language newspaper: "It is a mistake to come to Mexico and not try the local cuisine. It is not the Tex-Mex cooking one is used to getting in the United States."<br><br>If you go to the library to look up Tex-Mex, you will find lots of definitions. But unfortunately they are all different. The dictionaries don't agree on whether Tex-Mex means Americanized Mexican food in general or specifically the kind from Texas.<br><br>Some food writers put San Francisco's steak burritos, San Diego's fish tacos, and Tucson's chimichangas in the Tex-Mex category. That's because they use the term Tex-Mex to mean Americanized Mexican food, regardless of its place of origin.<br><br>There is no consensus on what Tex-Mex means in Texas either. Middle-aged Anglos tend to describe it as a specific subset of the larger genre of Mexican food-one that involves yellow cheese enchiladas with chopped raw onions and chili gravy as served in San Antonio around 1955.<br><br>Why the confusion? Because for many years, the people who owned the restaurants where Tex-Mex was served refused to use the term at all. Tex-Mex was a slur. It was a euphemism for bastardized, and it was an insult that cost Mexican-Texan families who had been in the restaurant business for generations a lot of business.<br>Tex-Mex was still called Mexican food when its popularity began to spread beyond Texas to other parts of the country. But the biggest fans of Tex-Mex have always been west of the Mississippi. Texas-Mexican food first became popular in the Midwest in 1893, when a San Antonio chili stand was set up at the Chicago World's Fair. Chili con carne was being canned in Oklahoma and St. Louis by 1910. Cincinnati's first chili joint opened in 1922. And more chili joints sprung up across the country, becoming Depression-era havens for cheap food. Meanwhile, tamale vendors popularized another kind of Mexican food across the country. In <i>The World on a Plate</i>, food historian Joel Denker tells us tamales were among the most common foods on the streets of Chicago in the early 1900s and were far more popular than hamburgers.<br><br>Because of their greater familiarity with its traditions, food writers and cooking authorities from the western half of the country think of Tex-Mex more sympathetically than do their New York counterparts.<br><br>"I love Tex-Mex. I grew up on it," says Rick Bayless, author of <i>Authentic Mexican</i> and <i>Mexico One Plate at a Time</i>.<br><br>In his cookbooks, Bayless, who comes from Oklahoma, pays tribute to Tex-Mex as a distinctive regional cuisine. "When people cook from the heart, there isn't a right, or wrong, way to do it," he told me. Bayless said that when writing <i>Authentic Mexican</i>, his first cookbook, which was published in 1987, he wanted to include Tex-Mex as well as New Mexican and California Mexican. But his New York editor didn't share his point of view.<br><br>In <i>Eating in America: A History</i> (1976), the late Chicago food writer Waverly Root defines Tex-Mex as a unique regional cuisine: "Tex-Mex food might be described as native foreign food, contradictory through that term may seem. It is native, for it does not exist elsewhere; it was born on this soil. But it is foreign in that its inspiration came from an alien cuisine; that it has never merged into the mainstream of American cooking and remains alive almost solely in the region where it originated . . ."<br><br>Today, most people agree that Tex-Mex isn't really Mexican food. And for reasons I hope this book will explain, Tex-Mex has started to shed its negative connotations. In the last five years, some of the same Texas-Mexican restaurants that once shunned the term have begun to claim they invented Tex-Mex!<br><br>Meanwhile, historians are beginning to study "Tex-Mex" more seriously. As it has become more widely understood to describe an American regional cooking style, it has also begun to be used retroactively. Culinary folklorists now trace Tex-Mex cooking all the way back to the state's Native American peoples and to Juan de Onate's colonists who first brought European livestock to El Paso in 1581.<br><br>"Tex-Mex foods are a combination of Indian and Spanish cuisines, which came together to make a distinct new cuisine," writes Joe S. Graham in the Texas State Historical Society's Handbook of Texas Online.<br><br>For all these reasons, I thought this might be a good time for a Tex-Mex cookbook. For the past ten years, I have been gathering scraps that I thought might shed some light on the story of Tex-Mex cooking. From restaurants and museums, garage sales and presidential libraries, I've collected recipes, snapshots, menus, postcards, and advertisements for canned chili. And I've interviewed a bunch of colorful veterans of the Tex-Mex restaurant business. In this book, I have put those scraps together. The result is not a complete picture but a fragmented collage made up of one man's gleanings.<br><br>It's been more than thirty years since <i>The Cuisines of Mexico</i> was published, and many of its baroque Mexican dishes seem like museum pieces now, while at the same time, Tex-Mex has achieved worldwide popularity.<br><br>We can all thank Diana Kennedy for inadvertently granting Tex-Mex its rightful place in food history. By convincing us that Tex-Mex wasn't really Mexican food, she forced us to realize that it was something far more interesting: America's oldest regional cuisine.<br><br>***<br><br>DEFINING "TEX-MEX"<br>-<i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>: "Designating the Texan variety of something Mexican.

I had Dominic, my sister&#x2019;s diabetic foxhound, who followed me from room to room, lumbering onto my lap, unaware of his bulk. I liked the smell of his meaty breath, which he didn&#x2019;t know was rancid. I liked the warmth of his fat belly, the primal way he crouched when he took a shit. It felt so intimate scooping his gigantic shits, the big hot bags of them. I thought, This is the proper use of my love, this is the man for me, this is the way.<br><br>The beach house was a contemporary glass fortress, sparse enough to remind me nothing of my life back home. I could disappear in a good way: as if never having existed, unlike the way I felt I was disappearing all fall, winter, and spring in my hot, cluttered apartment in Phoenix, surrounded by reminders of myself and Jamie, suffocating in what was mine. There are good and bad ways of vanishing. I wanted no more belongings.<br><br>On the second-�story deck of the beach house I escaped the hell of my own smelly bathrobe, wearing one of the silk kimonos my sister had left behind. I fell asleep out there every night, tipsy on white wine, under the Venice stars, with my feet tucked under Dominic&#x2019;s gut, belonging to nothing familiar. I felt no pressure to fall asleep, and so, after nine months of insomnia, I was finally able to drift off easily every night. Then at three a.m. I would wake gently and traipse to the bed with the Egyptian cotton sheets, kicking my legs all over them in celebration, rolling around and touching my own skin as though I were a stranger touching someone foreign, or cradling the big back of the dog to my front to die to the world for another eight hours. I might have even been happy.<br><br>And yet, walking on Abbot Kinney Boulevard one night at the end of my first week there, passing the windows of the yuppie shops&#x2014;�each their own white cube gallery&#x2014;�I saw two people, a man and a woman, early twenties maybe, definitely on a first or second date, and I knew I still wasn&#x2019;t okay. They were discussing intently where they should go to eat and drink, as though it really mattered. He had an accent, German, I think, and was handsome and fuckable: hair close-�cropped and boyish, strong arms, an Adam&#x2019;s apple that protruded and made me think of sucking on it.<br><br>The woman was, as the undergrads at the Arizona university where I worked as a librarian might say, a butterface.<br><br>For nine years I had been at Southwest State in the dual lit and classics PhD program. Somehow, miraculously, despite having not yet turned in my thesis, they hadn&#x2019;t withdrawn my funding. In exchange for thirty hours of work per week in the library, I was housed in a below-�market-rent apartment off-�campus and received a yearly stipend of $33,000. I was supposed to be working on a book-�length project entitled &#x201c;The Accentual Gap: Sappho&#x2019;s Spaces as Essence.&#x201d; This year, as a result of my tardiness, I&#x2019;d been appointed a new advisory committee, comprised of both the classics and English department chairpersons, and I was no longer flying under the radar.<br><br>In March, I had met with them at a Panera Bread, where they delivered the news over paninis&#x2014;�Napa almond chicken salad for the English chair in her coffee-�stained Easter sweater and tuna salad for the classics chair, his nose swollen with rosacea&#x2014;�that I was to have a full draft completed by the fall semester or my funding would be pulled and I would be out. So far, this had not made me hustle any faster.<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t that I no longer felt impassioned by Sappho. I did, or sort of did, as much as you can feel impassioned by anyone you have lived with for nine years. But it had dawned on me around year six that the thesis of my thesis, its whole raison d&#x2019;�tre, was faulty. In fact, it was not just faulty. It was total bullshit. But I didn&#x2019;t know how to fix it. So I&#x2019;d just been riding it out.<br><br>The book operated under the notion that scholars always assumed a first-�person speaker when reading Sappho&#x2019;s poetry. Scholars were kind of assholes and they actually hated mystery&#x2014;�they detested any inability to fill in the blanks. They were victims, like the rest of us, of the way their brains worked: trying to compartmentalize every fragment of information into a pattern. They wanted the world to make sense. Who didn&#x2019;t? So when reading Sappho&#x2019;s work, they took details that they already knew, or thought they knew, of Sappho&#x2019;s life, and used them to fill in the blanks. But they did so erroneously, like a psychologist who, after learning three extraneous things about a person&#x2019;s childhood, believes they know the whole person.<br><br>My book presented the argument that one should read the vast number of erasures in Sappho&#x2019;s work as intentional. True, Sappho had not included these herself. They were created by the passage of time and dirt since 600 BCE. Most of her work was actually missing, with only 650 lines of 10,000 surviving. But I argued that to reimagine these blanks as created by Sappho herself was far less of a co-�option than filling in the gaps with what little we know of her life, creating our own meanings for them out of a desire to make history our own, and above all, projecting a first-�person speaker upon them. I felt that the only way we would cease projecting was if the blanks were read as intentional text themselves. Forget whether she was a lesbian, preferred younger men, was hypersexual, bisexual, or had multiple male lovers. If we were going to ascribe meaning, let&#x2019;s do it with what was there rather than what was not there.<br><br>Unfortunately this was a total garbage proposition. I, myself, had a very complicated relationship with emptiness, blankness, nothingness. Sometimes I wanted only to fill it, frightened that if I didn&#x2019;t it would eat me alive or kill me. But sometimes I longed for total annihilation in it&#x2014;�a beautiful, silent erasure. A desire to be vanished. And so I was most guilty of all in projecting an agenda. I knew it, which was why I had not really pressed ahead. I wasn&#x2019;t sure if my advisory committee knew it. But I was about to be cut off and I figured that a shitty book was probably better than no book at all.<br><br>So I continued to trudge, not wanting to quit and get a &#x201c;real&#x201d; job, not really knowing what I could do anyway. Most of my time in public was spent in the library, amidst the undergrads, and that was where I had heard them use the words butterface and brown bagger. They used these words to describe women of attractive body and unattractive face, and this woman on Abbot Kinney was, in my opinion, definitely one. I moved quickly behind her to observe her further.<br><br>Her visage, when she turned her head to talk to the man, was hard and pronounced, with a jutting nose and chin, but she had good hair and a hot body to save her. She wore a pair of tiny navy silk shorts from which the very bottom of her ass cheeks protruded ever so slightly. You almost felt compelled to touch them. Everything she said was filtered through her own awareness of how good her ass looked, the words she spoke merely an afterthought compared to the glory at the bottom of those shorts. She was almost like a vehicle for shorts and an ass. She sort of danced a little down the sidewalk and flicked her hair.<br><br>He was no better. He asked stupid questions&#x2014;�&#x201c;So how long have you lived here?&#x201d; and &#x201c;Do you like it?&#x201d;&#x2014;�but every question was a chance to put his own hotness into action. Why were they even bothering to speak? Who had time for all of this? Why weren&#x2019;t they just fucking, right there, out in the open? The entire performance was merely a vessel for something else. It was nothingness.<br><br>Sure, compared to the greater nothingness&#x2014;�the void, the lack of explicit meaning in life, the fact that none of us knows what is going on here&#x2014;�it was at least something. Their engagement in this dance of elevating a stupid restaurant to high levels of importance, discussing kombucha, making the fleeting matter, the shorts: all of these were a fuck-�you to emptiness. Or perhaps these details were symptomatic of their ignorance of nothingness. Was nothingness so imperceptible to them that these things could matter?<br><br>Could anyone be totally ignorant of the void? Didn&#x2019;t all of us have an awareness of it, a brush with it&#x2014;�perhaps only once or twice, like at a funeral for someone very close to you, when you walked out of the funeral home and it stopped making sense for just a blip that you existed. Or perhaps a bad mushroom trip where one&#x2019;s fellow trippers looked like plastic. Could there be people on this Earth who never stopped for a moment, not once, to say: What is everything?<br><br>Whether these were those people or not, I knew that in this moment neither of them was asking that question. If they had tasted the nausea of not knowing why we are here or who we are, or if they had not, now they were willfully and successfully ignoring it. Or maybe they were just stupid. Oh, the sweet gift of stupidity. I envied them.<br><br>But really, I knew that everything came down to her shorts. All of the answers were in that ass line&#x2014;�the reduction of all fear, all unknown, all nothingness, eclipsed by the ass line. It was holding its own in all of this. It was just existing as though living was easy. The ass line didn&#x2019;t really have to do anything, but it was running the whole show. All dialogue began and ended at that ass line. The direction of their evening, their dialogue, and in a way, the universe ended there. I hated them.<br><br>I hated their ease with everything. I hated their lack of loneliness, their sense of time stretching out languidly like something to be toyed with, as though it were never going to get too late tonight or in their lives. I didn&#x2019;t know who I resented more: the man or the woman.<br><br>Chapter 2<br><br>I have always felt that it would be good to be a man. Not only have I always wanted to have my own dick&#x2014;�just to walk around feeling that weight between my legs, that power&#x2014;�but I have longed to escape the time pressures that my body has put on me. I hated the German man on Abbot Kinney for having that, no time pressure. I hated the woman too, for being so young, for having so much time left to be hot and maybe someday have a baby.<br><br>I had never wanted a baby. I never felt the desire so many women describe that suddenly hits them. Having just turned thirty-�eight, I had been waiting and waiting for that desire to overtake me, but it didn&#x2019;t. So I always looked on it casually, like something mildly distasteful: a piece of onion I would prefer not to put on my plate.<br><br>But I loved having the option of having a baby if I still wanted one. I liked having the future ahead of me. People say that youth is wasted on the young and I agree in so many respects that it was wasted on me, but in one way I had appreciated it. I always had a sense of my privilege with time. Part of my casualness with the question of having children was that I sensed how lucky I was that I could one day have the choice if I wanted. I liked that that day was very far off. The distance felt luxurious.<br><br>I had secretly judged women who regretted never having children and were now no longer of the age at which they could have them. I judged them, perhaps, because I feared becoming them. But now at thirty-�eight, my time was beginning to run out. I still didn&#x2019;t want a child. I didn&#x2019;t know what I would do with a child if I had one. But I missed having that open space before me in which to decide. And if that ass-�cheeks woman had been paying attention to me, I knew she would have judged me as I had judged others my age.<br><br>She might have also judged me for being unmarried. When Jamie and I first met, I told him that marriage was an archaic declaration of ownership and it wasn&#x2019;t for me. He said &#x201c;good,&#x201d; because it wasn&#x2019;t his thing either. But four years into the relationship I wanted desperately for Jamie to ask me to marry him, if only because he wouldn&#x2019;t. I&#x2019;d never been a jewelry person, but something inside me longed for that ring. Outwardly I shit-�talked blood diamonds, while quietly I studied other women&#x2019;s rings, learning the names of the various diamond cuts: cushion, emerald, princess. I swore that married women used their left hands more than their right when they spoke, gestured, or wiped a stray hair out of their eyes, just to rub it in. They seemed to be saying, Look, someone wants me this much. I have safely made it to the other shore.<br><br>But what would I have even done as a married person? What would I have done with Jamie in my space or me in his? Choosing Jamie to love for so many years was perhaps more of a symbol of my own fear of intimacy than it was of his. He was intoxicating when we first met: a geologist, 6&#x2019;2&#x201d;, handsome in an L.L.Bean travel vest sort of way, golden brown and unshaven with sandy-�brown hair, ten years my senior. He made me feel like a special little pea. Through his work in the desert with the university, he had received a grant from the American Geological Fund to make documentaries on the national parks. He always directed and edited the docs himself, and the grant gave him the power to travel, be free, and always be producing. Even though the documentaries aired at two a.m. on limited cable channels, he could never be accused of failing. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m more with the scientists than the artists,&#x201d; he said. But he had the allure of an artist.<br><br>In our earlier years together I traveled to see him on location often. I spent my holiday breaks in an Airstream at Acadia National Park, Glacier, Yosemite. He would go on shoots all day and I would go out exploring, bringing back little souvenirs. He loved hearing what I had seen, correcting my landscape terminology. My favorites were the lakes and oceans, the rivers and waterfalls, like nothing we had in the desert. The rushing water, and traveling in general, made me feel like my life was moving forward, in spite of my flagging thesis. I identified myself with his work. It felt adventurous.</p><h2>History of the Philippines: From Indios Bravos to Filipinos</h2><p>From ancient Malay settlements to Spanish colonization, the American occupation and beyond, A History of the Philippines recasts various Philippine narratives with an eye for the layers of colonial and post-colonial history that have created this diverse and fascinating population. A History of the Philippines begins with the pre-Westernized Philippines in the 16th century and continues through the 1899 Philippine-American War, the nation's relationship with the United States&#x2019; controlling presence, culminating with its independence in 1946 and two ongoing insurgencies, one Islamic and one Communist. Luis H. Francia creates an illuminating portrait that offers the reader valuable insights into the heart and soul of the modern Filipino, laying bare the multicultural, multiracial society of contemporary times.</p><p>Luis H. Francia was born in the Philippines and moved to New York in the 1970s. He teaches at the City University of Hong Kong, Hunter College, and New York University.<b>Praise for Luis H.

In this collection, human desire pulls with the force and rhythm of a sea tide, emerging from and receding into mysteries larger than any individual life. The book begins with the reverential title poem and concludes with four works that reflect the power of place to shape revelation; the way stone and sky and birdsong can point the way home. Whether tracing the sensual devotion of bodily presence or the painful heartbreak of impermanence, the poems keep faith with love&#39;s appearances and disappearances, and the promises we make and break on its behalf.</p><p>Poet David Whyte grew up with a strong, imaginative influence from his Irish mother among the hills and valleys of his father s Yorkshire. He now makes his home, with his family, in the Pacific Northwest of the United States.<br><br>The author of seven books of poetry and four books of prose, David Whyte holds a degree in Marine Zoology and has traveled extensively, including living and working as a naturalist guide in the Galapagos Islands and leading anthropological and natural history expeditions in the Andes, the Amazon and the Himalaya. He brings this wealth of experience to his poetry, lectures and workshops.<br><br>His life as a poet has created a readership and listenership in three normally mutually exclusive areas: the literate world of readings that most poets inhabit, the psychological and theological worlds of philosophical enquiry and the world of vocation, work and organizational leadership.<br><br>An Associate Fellow at Templeton College and Said Business School at the University of Oxford, he is one of the few poets to take his perspectives on creativity into the field of organizational development, where he works with many European, American and international companies. In spring of 2008 he was awarded an honorary doctorate from Neumann College, Pennsylvania. <br><br>In organizational settings, using poetry and thoughtful commentary, he illustrates how we can foster qualities of courage and engagement; qualities needed if we are to respond to today's call for increased creativity and adaptability in the workplace. He brings a unique and important contribution to our understanding of the nature of individual and organizational change particularly through his perspectives on Conversational Leadership.</p><h2>Thankless in Death</h2><p><b>In this thriller in the #1<i> New York Times</i> bestselling In Death series, Lieutenant Eve Dallas discovers that deep hatred can seethe within the closest relationships when she hunts down a man who murdered his own family.</b><br><br> Lieutenant Eve Dallas has plenty to be grateful for, especially Roarke&#x2019;s big Irish family, which is a joyful improvement on her own dark childhood.<br><br> Other couples aren&#x2019;t as lucky.

In addition, nothing in the cookie-cutter plot couldn&#39;t have happened in the present or near past. On impulse, 26-year-old Jerald Reinhold, an unemployed loser, stabs his mother, Barbara, to death in his parents&#39; Manhattan apartment, where he waits until his father, Carl, comes home so he can bludgeon Carl with a baseball bat. Lt. Eve Dallas, of the New York Police and Security Department, gets on Reinhold&#39;s trail, but the savvy veteran makes a rookie mistake by not warning a clear target of Reinhold&#39;s rage that she could be the next victim. Eve also has trouble assessing her quarry. At one point she calls Reinhold a fucking moron, then adds he&#39;s cannier than I gave him credit for initially. Readers will have to judge for themselves.

From his roots in an impoverished East Texas family to his years of womanizing, boozing, brawling, and singing with the voice that made him a star, his story is a nonstop rollercoaster ride of the price of fame. It is also the story of how the love of a good woman, his wife Nancy, helped him clean up his act.</p><p>George Jones has been called the greatest country singer of our time.&nbsp;&nbsp;He lives&nbsp;&nbsp;in Nashville with his wife, Nancy.<br><br>Tom Carter has co-authored books with Ralph Emery, Reba McEntire among others.&nbsp;&nbsp;He lives in Nashville.Chapter 1<br> &nbsp;<br> The grasshoppers were so thick that summer their swarming blocked the sunlight. Like the Old Testament locusts that fell on Egypt, they covered the parched East Texas ground like a rug. I had a brother-in-law, W. T. &#x201c;Dub&#x201d; Scroggins, who was much older than me, and I called him my uncle. His cash crop, cotton, had survived hail and high winds that year. But it would never stand up to the bugs.<br> &nbsp;<br> Dub was never one to get hysterical, and he kept his composure when others lost theirs. His head was always as level as his spirit was sweet. He had a wisdom that sprang from the soil. He gave the ground his toil, and it gave him a savvy that made him smarter than his years.<br> &nbsp;<br> I stayed with him and his wife, my sister Helen, on their farm twenty miles southeast of Waco during summers when I was a boy. I lived the rest of the year with my parents, brother, and sisters in one of three humble houses in East Texas.<br> &nbsp;<br> Dub woke me one day that summer before daylight.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;George,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;the grasshoppers are going to take the cotton. I don&#x2019;t give it much more than a week. They&#x2019;re devouring every farm in this county. I&#x2019;ve been thinking about it, and today we&#x2019;re going to take back what&#x2019;s ours.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> We ate breakfast before sunrise, but that was not early enough to beat the insects to the field. By the time we had walked to Dub&#x2019;s seventy acres, the grasshoppers had already flown from the weeds into the cotton, where they&#x2019;d eat all day. At sundown they&#x2019;d fly back into the weeds, where they would roost, filled with the cotton that Dub had planted by hand. There was probably a drop of his sweat in every boll.<br> &nbsp;<br> My sister Helen is ten years older than me, and she was married at sixteen, before I started the first grade. I looked up to Dub, literally and figuratively, and thought he looked the way God would if God wore denim. This time, I was looking to Dub to see what he would do. Even as a child, I understood the tragedy that was happening before me&#x2014;tons of ruin from insects weighing less than an ounce each.<br> &nbsp;<br> From inside Dub&#x2019;s barn, I heard the swing of his hammer. He was driving nails into scrap lumber, fashioning it into a sled. It was no more than a four-foot-square platform surrounded by two-by-fours that were waist-high to me. It had a rail, and I was supposed to hang on while I drove Dub&#x2019;s mule through the cotton.<br> &nbsp;<br> He opened a burlap sack filled with bran. Dust boiled inside the barn&#x2019;s stale air when Dub thrust a scoop into the grain. The barn was like a furnace even though the sun was just barely in the sky. I&#x2019;ve never been anywhere hotter than Texas in the summertime.<br> &nbsp;<br> Dub poured the grain into a five-gallon bucket and added syrup. He stirred the mixture into a thick cereal.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to feed the grasshoppers today, George,&#x201d; he said. I thought I saw a smile.<br> &nbsp;<br> Then he poured out a white-gray powder. A tiny cloud of dust again fumed upward as Dub poured arsenic into the mixture.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Whatever you do, don&#x2019;t get any of this in your mouth,&#x201d; Dub said.<br> &nbsp;<br> I drove the mule and sled that held the pail of poison through the cotton rows. Dub walked a few feet behind and slung his homemade brew from the bucket onto the cotton. In seconds, the bushes became the final resting place for the hungry grasshoppers.<br> &nbsp;<br> As the sun eased over the horizon, its light glistened on the sticky bolls and the goo dripped onto the ground. Dub soon had globs of poisonous molasses clinging to his brogans.<br> &nbsp;<br> The grasshoppers died the instant they ate, their fat bodies stuck in the mixture that had been their last meal. The cotton was dotted with dead bugs.<br> &nbsp;<br> At least part of the crop was saved for another year. I could feel Dub&#x2019;s excitement about his home remedy&#x2019;s success. I stopped that mule only long enough for Dub to dip more poison into his bucket from the tub on the sled. We stood there, sweating and laughing at the wake of dead grasshoppers behind us.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Get up there,&#x201d; I yelled at the mule, and the sled and the killing went forward. Even Dub&#x2019;s dog became excited and soon was barking wildly at something it had pinned down in nearby Johnson grass. Dub and I approached the dog curiously.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Watch your step, George,&#x201d; Dub said. &#x201c;It might be a snake.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Dub saw it first, a skunk with its tail raised and pointed toward our hound. It could spray its stinky mist in a heartbeat, and the stench wouldn&#x2019;t evaporate from its target for weeks. Dub told me about a man whose English saddle was sprayed. The man scrubbed it with lye soap and a brush, but never got rid of the smell. He had to bury the saddle.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Get away from here, boy!&#x201d; Dub shouted, and I got excited and ran like I was on fire toward the waiting mule. I was yelling, and that&#x2019;s probably what spooked the old mule. It bolted with the sled and sloshing poison in tow. Trouble is, the mule didn&#x2019;t run down the cotton rows. It ran across them. Cotton bushes were uprooted and flying like bowling pins. I was hollering at the mule and wanted to dive for the sled, but I feared the flying poison.<br> &nbsp;<br> Soon the tub was empty, and it began rattling loudly on the sled. The noise frightened the mule even more, and he cleared the cotton patch and started up the lane for the barn. By now nothing was left of the sled except one or two boards, and they were fast becoming splinters. I kept hollering and waving for the mule to stop. That also scared the mule, and Dub was right behind me, hollering and waving for me to stop hollering and waving.<br> &nbsp;<br> There was a gate between the lane and the barn, and the mule ran toward it full-tilt. I don&#x2019;t think it even slowed down before it went through. Dub said he could hear the barbed wire ping before it snapped on both sides of the gate.<br> &nbsp;<br> The gate and sled were little more than splinters. The tub that had contained the poison was reduced to dented sheet metal. The mule was bleeding from cuts from cotton bolls and the shattered gate.<br> &nbsp;<br> I started crying because of what I&#x2019;d done and because Dub was screaming. I just knew he was going to be furious, and I ducked when he raised his arms. When they came down, they didn&#x2019;t strike me. They wrapped around me. I could feel his heavy breathing inside his embrace. My tears ran into his sweat.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Ain&#x2019;t no reason to cry, George,&#x201d; Dub said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re a lot better off than the grasshoppers.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> We waited for the mule to cool off before Dub smeared something like lard on its scratches. We spent the rest of the day building another sled and hammering out the battered metal into another tub. At daylight the next morning we were out there again, Dab sloshing his killing paste and me driving the mule.<br> &nbsp;<br> I refused to turn loose of the mule the second day. Helen brought food at noon, and I ate with one hand. I wouldn&#x2019;t take the other from the mule&#x2019;s reins.<br> &nbsp;<br> I lived with Dub and Helen again the following summer and was joined by my sisters Ruth and Doris. We had no electricity, and no money for ice, so Doris did what a lot of folks did&#x2014;she put milk and other perishables in the well to keep them cool.<br> &nbsp;<br> She tied a glass jug of cow&#x2019;s milk to the water bucket and let both sink gently beneath the dark water ten feet below ground level. The next day Doris drew a bucket of water, forgetting about the milk jug. It banged against the side of the well, shattered, and the water filled with glass and unprocessed cow&#x2019;s milk.<br> &nbsp;<br> Doris was always blaming me for what she did, so when I saw Dub walk his mules up to the gate after a day of plowing, I ran to him.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Doris is going to tell you I broke the milk in the well, but she did it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She told him her story just as I had predicted. He didn&#x2019;t believe her for an instant. Doris cried, but not as much as she did when Dub told her she&#x2019;d have to drain the well&#x2014;by hand.<br> &nbsp;<br> The nearest water was seven miles away in Mount Calm. Dub couldn&#x2019;t afford to give up the use of his wagon and team for the day required to haul it. Besides, the small amount of water he could carry would not have lasted long. And we could never drink the new rainwater that would fall into the well until it was drained of the spoiled milk.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;There is just no way around it, girls,&#x201d; Dub told my sisters. &#x201c;That well is going to have to be drained, bucket by bucket.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I think he would have made me help Doris if she hadn&#x2019;t lied.<br> &nbsp;<br> When Dub arrived in the middle of the next morning, the girls were arguing about who had drawn the last bucket of water and crying and fighting. He had cut his plowing short because he knew those two could never finish such a big job.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Why are you drawing your well dry in the summertime?&#x201d; an old man shouted from the dirt road in front of Dub&#x2019;s place. He&#x2019;d been watching the goings-on for some time before he spoke. He couldn&#x2019;t understand why farm folks were pouring drinking water onto the ground in the sweltering summer heat.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Smell the well!&#x201d; Dub answered. &#x201c;These here silly girls broke a jug of cow&#x2019;s milk in the water, and it&#x2019;s not fit to drink.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The old man spit out tobacco, laughed, and approached the well.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You got a Mason jar?&#x201d; he asked.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Why sure,&#x201d; Dub said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Go get &#x2019;er for me with some pounds of salt.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> With the precision of an Indian medicine man, the old fella measured the salt into the jar and poured it into the bucket. He lowered the bucket into the well and told Doris to pull the rope up and down to churn the water.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That salt will dissolve, and what don&#x2019;t dissolve will settle,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;And when it does, your water won&#x2019;t stink no more, and it will be fit for drinking after you boil out the salt.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Before the old man left, Dub paid him with all of his remaining salt. The old man argued about taking it. The next day, his prophecy came true.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Revelation 1-11 MacArthur New Testament Commentary (Volume 32) (MacArthur New Testament Commentary Series)</h2><p><p>No book in the scripture reveals the glory of God and Christ in more splendor than Revelation.&nbsp;At the same time, no book has been more misunderstood or neglected.&nbsp;Yet God wants His children to know this book, and&nbsp;blessings are stored up&nbsp;for those who study its riches.</p><p>Join John MacArthur as he explains each verse in a way that is both doctrinally precise and intensely practical.&nbsp;Taking into account the cultural, theological, and Old Testament contexts of each passage, MacArthur tackles interpretive challenges and fairly evaluates differing views, giving the reader confidence in his conclusions. </p><p>The MacArthur New Testament Commentary series comes from the experience, wisdom, and insight of one of the most trusted ministry leaders and Bible scholars of our day.

This will ultimately "be a world religion."&nbsp; Still topical in light of the conflicts resulting from efforts to establish the European Community and the New Global Order.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p></p><h2>A First-Rate Madness: Uncovering the Links Between Leadership and Mental Illness</h2><p>This <i>New York Times</i> bestseller is a myth-shattering exploration of the powerful connections between mental illness and leadership. Historians have long puzzled over the apparent mental instability of great and terrible leaders alike: Napoleon, Lincoln, Churchill, Hitler, and others. In A First-Rate Madness, Nassir Ghaemi, director of the Mood Disorders Programme at Tufts Medical Center, offers and sets forth a controversial, compelling thesis: the very qualities that mark those with mood disorders also make for the best leaders in times of crisis. From the importance of Lincoln's "depressive realism" to the lacklustre leadership of exceedingly sane men as Neville Chamberlain, <i>A First-Rate Madness</i> overturns many of our most cherished perceptions about greatness and the mind.</p><p><b>Nassir Ghaemi, M.D</b>., is a professor of psychiatry at Tufts University School of Medicine and director of the Mood Disorders Program at Tufts Medical Center in Boston.

His explanations are elegant, too&#x2014;intuitively accurate and banked off the latest psychiatric research.&#x201d;&nbsp;<i><b>&#x2014;Newsweek</b></i><br><br>&#x201c;A provocative thesis...

For over twenty years, Walt helped breathe life into the new golden age of animation with these teachings at the Walt Disney Animation Studios and influenced such talented artists as Tim Burton, Brad Bird, Glen Keane, and John Lasseter. These writings represent the quintessential refresher for fine artists and film professionals, and it is a vital tutorial for students who are now poised to be part of another new generation in the art form. <br><br>* Legendary lessons from a master Disney animator - meet the man who put the wiggle in Jessica Rabbit's walk!<br>* Packed full of illustrations from some of the top animators in the world including Brad Bird, Glen Keane and John Lasseter<br>* Two volumes and 800 pages of pure gold - get in-depth advice and instruction on bringing your characters to life <p></p> <table> <tbody><tr> <td><p><b><b>Sample Pages from <i>Drawn to Life: 20 Golden Years of Disney Master Classes, Volume 1</i></b></b></p><i>(Click images for larger versions)</i> </td></tr><tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> </tbody></table></p><p><p>For nearly thirty years, the artists that passed through the gates of Disney Animation, and even non-artists like myself, were influenced by the craft, skill, wisdom, writings and sketches of Walt Stanchfield.</p> <p><i>Roy Disney</i></p> <p>Walt was a kind of Mark Twain for us at Disney. He always taught with humor and skill. You learned to see the world through his eyes. I remember him one day encouraging us to leap into our drawings with boldness and confidence, "Don't be afraid to make a mistake. We all have 10,000 bad drawings in us so the sooner you get them out the better!" Sitting in Walt's class was as much a psychology course as it was a drawing class. One couldn't help walk away with your mind and soul a little more open than when you entered. </p> <p><i>Glen Keane, Walt Disney Animation Studios</i></p> <p>Walt Stanchfield's classes and writings were little distillations of the man: quirky, strongly stated in a genial voice, and brimming with a lifetime of sharp observations about story telling and graphic communication. Whether he drew with a ball point pen or painted with a brush dipped in his coffee cup, he got to the essence of things and was eager to share what he learned to his eager disciples, myself among them. He was grizzled and he was great and proof that there was more than one Walt at the Disney Studio that could inspire a legion of artists.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><i>John Musker, Walt Disney Animation Studios</i></p> <p>Walt Stanchfield was one of Disney Animation's national treasures. His classes and notes have inspired countless animation artists, and his approach to drawing of caricature over reality, feeling over rote accuracy, and communication over&nbsp;photographic reproduction gets to the heart of what great animation is all about. Huzzah to Don Hahn for putting it all together for us!</p> <p><i>Eric Goldberg, Walt Disney Animation Studios</i></p> <p>During the Animation Renaissance of the 1990s, one of the Walt Disney Studio's best kept secrets was Walt Stanchfield. Once a week after work, this aged but agile figure jumped from drawing board to drawing board, patiently teaching us the principles behind the high baroque style of Walt Disney Animation drawing. Being in a room with Walt made you feel what it must have been like to have been taught by Don Graham. Having one of your life drawings be good enough to be reproduced in one of his little homemade weekly bulletins was akin to getting a Distinguished Service medal! Senior animators vied with trainees for that distinction.</p> <p><i>Tom Sito, Animator/Filmmaker/Author of Drawing The Line: The Untold Story of the Animation Unions from Bosko to Bart Simpson</i></p> <p>This exciting collection of master classes by the great teacher Walt Stanchfield is destined to become a classic on the order of Kimon Nicolaides' exploration of the drawing process. Stanchfield (1919-2000) inspired several generations of Disney animators and those of us outside the studio fortunate enough to happen upon dog-eared copies of his conversational notes, which we passed around like Leonardo's Codex Leicester. Stanchfield beautifully communicates the essence and joy of expressing ideas through the graphic line and accumulating a visual vocabulary. DRAWN TO LIFE is a treasure trove of cogent, valuable information for students, teachers and anyone who loves to draw.</p> <p><i>John Canemaker, NYU professor and Academy Award-winning animation filmmaker</i></p> <p>Walt Stanchfield, in his own unique way, taught so many of us about drawing, caricature, motion, acting and animation. Most important to me, was how Walt made you apply what you had observed in his life drawing class to your animation. Disney Animation is based on real life, and in that regard Walt Stanchfield's philosophy echoed Walt Disney's:</p> <p>'We cannot caricature and animate anything convincingly until we study the real thing first.'</p> <p><i>Andreas Deja, Walt Disney Animation Studios</i></p> <p>Walt Stanchfield's renewed emphasis on draftsmanship at the Disney Studios transformed the seemingly moribund art of animation. His students were part of a renaissance with The Little Mermaid and Who Framed Roger Rabbit, a renaissance that continues with films ranging from The Iron Giant to Lilo and Stitch to Wall-E.</p> <p><i>Charles Solomon, Animation Historian</i></p> <p>I'm so grateful to Focal Press for publishing these fabulous Walt Stanchfield books. They are veritable 'gold dust' for the serious (and aspiring) animator! So 'hurrah' to Focal and 'hurrah' to Don Hahn to committing himself to compiling them. I ordered my copies the minute I saw them and will of course hope my students are smart enough to do so too!&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Tony White, DigiPen, Author of 'Animation: From Pencil to Pixels' and 'How to Make Animated Films'</i></p></p><h2>The Secret Life of Trees: How They Live and Why They Matter (Penguin Press Science)</h2><p>In very good condition.

This comprehensive and readable book presents a political philosophy from the perspective that the Gospel pertains to all of life so Christians should be involved in political issues. In brief, this is an analysis of conservative and liberal plans to do good for the nation, evaluated in light of the Bible and common sense.In this ground-breaking book, recognized evangelical Bible professor Wayne Grudem rejects five mistaken views about Christian influence on politics: (1) &#x201c;compel religion,&#x201d; (2) &#x201c;exclude religion,&#x201d; (3) &#x201c;all government is demonic,&#x201d; (4) &#x201c;do evangel-ism, not politics,&#x201d; and (5) &#x201c;do politics, not evangelism.&#x201d; He proposes a better alternative: (6) &#x201c;significant Christian influence on government.&#x201d; Then he explains the Bible&#x2019;s teachings about the purpose of civil government and the characteristics of good or bad government. Does the Bible support some form of democracy? Should judges and the courts hold the ultimate power in a nation? With respect to specific political issues, Grudem argues that most people&#x2019;s political views depend on deep-seated assumptions about several basic moral and even theological questions, such as whether God exists, whether absolute moral standards can be known, whether there is good and evil in each person&#x2019;s heart, whether people should be accountable for their good and bad choices, whether property should belong to individuals or to society, and whether the purpose of the earth&#x2019;s resources is to bring benefit to mankind. After addressing these foundational questions, Grudem provides a thoughtful, carefully-reasoned analysis of over fifty specific issues dealing with the protection of life, marriage, the family and children, economic issues and taxation, the environment, national defense, relationships to other nations, freedom of speech and religion, quotas, and special interests. He makes frequent application to the current policies of the Democratic and Republican parties in the United States, but the principles discussed here are relevant for any nation.</p><p>"Precisely and exactly the call the rising generation needs to hear" <br> &nbsp; -- Timothy Goeglein, Vice President, External Relations, Focus on the Family <br><br>Written by the author of the bestselling theology text in the world, this book not only considers today's most pressing issues, but also details the purpose of civil government and how Christians might best influence government.&nbsp; <i>Politics -- According to the Bible </i>may be the most important book you can read on how the Bible supports conservative political positions.Wayne Grudem is Research Professor of Theology and Biblical Studies at Phoenix Seminary in Phoenix, Arizona. He previously taught for twenty years at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, Deerfield, Illinois. He holds degrees from Harvard (BA), Westminster Seminary (MDiv), and Cambridge (PhD).

Shipler makes clear in this powerful, humane study, the invisible poor are engaged in the activity most respected in American ideology&#x2014;hard, honest work. But their version of the American Dream is a nightmare: low-paying, dead-end jobs; the profound failure of government to improve upon decaying housing, health care, and education; the failure of families to break the patterns of child abuse and substance abuse. Shipler exposes the interlocking problems by taking us into the sorrowful, infuriating, courageous lives of the poor&#x2014;white and black, Asian and Latino, citizens and immigrants. We encounter them every day, for they do jobs essential to the American economy. <br><br>This impassioned book not only dissects the problems, but makes pointed, informed recommendations for change. It is a book that stands to make a difference.</p></p><p><i>The Working Poor</i> examines the "forgotten America" where "millions live in the shadow of prosperity, in the twilight between poverty and well-being." These are citizens for whom the American Dream is out of reach despite their willingness to work hard. Struggling to simply survive, they live so close to the edge of poverty that a minor obstacle, such as a car breakdown or a temporary illness, can lead to a downward financial spiral that can prove impossible to reverse. David Shipler interviewed many such working people for this book and his profiles offer an intimate look at what it is like to be trapped in a cycle of dead-end jobs without benefits or opportunities for advancement. He shows how some negotiate a broken welfare system that is designed to help yet often does not, while others proudly refuse any sort of government assistance, even to their detriment. Still others have no idea that help is available at all. <p> "As a culture, the United States is not quite sure about the causes of poverty, and is therefore uncertain about the solutions," he writes. Though he details many ways in which current assistance programs could be more effective and rational, he does not believe that government alone, nor any other single variable, can solve the problem. Instead, a combination of things are required, beginning with the political will needed to create a relief system "that recognizes both the society's obligation through government and business, and the individual's obligation through labor and family." He does propose some specific steps in the right direction such as altering the current wage structure, creating more vocational programs (in both the public and private sectors), developing a fairer way to distribute school funding, and implementing basic national health care. </p><p> Prepare to have any preconceived notions about those living in poverty in America challenged by this affecting book. --<i>Shawn Carkonen</i></p><b>"The Working Poor<i> </i>is a powerful expos� that builds from page to page, from one grim revelation to another, until you have no choice but to leap out of your armchair and strike a blow for economic justice."<br>--Barbara Ehrenreich,<br>author, <i>Nickel and Dimed</i></b><br><br>"Through a combination of hard facts and moving accounts of hardships endured by individuals, David Shipler's new book fills in the gaps and denounces the many myths of the politically drawn caricatures and stereotypes of workers who live in poverty in America. His call to action powerfully argues that we must simultaneously address the full range of interrelated problems that confront the poor instead of tackling one issue at a time. It is a compelling book that will shift the terms of and reinvigorate the debate about social justice in America."<br>--Bill Bradley<br><br>"The 'working poor' ought to be an oxymoron, because no one who works should be impoverished. In this thoughtful assessment of poverty in twenty-first century America, David Shipler shows why so many working<br>Americans remain poor, and offers a powerful guide for how to resuscitate the American dream.

here I opened wide the door; &#x2014;<br>&nbsp;Darkness there, and nothing more.<br></p><p>Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,<br>Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;<br>But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,<br>And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, "Lenore?"<br>This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, "Lenore!" &#x2014;<br>&nbsp;Merely this, and nothing more.<br></p><p>Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,<br>Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.<br>"Surely," said I, "surely that is something at my window lattice:<br>Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore &#x2014;<br>Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore; &#x2014;<br>&nbsp;'Tis the wind and nothing more."<br></p><p>Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,<br>In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore;<br>Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;<br>But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door &#x2014;<br>Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door &#x2014;<br>&nbsp;Perched, and sat, and nothing more.<br></p><p>Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,<br>By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore.<br>"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou," I said, "art sure no craven,<br>Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the Nightly shore &#x2014;<br>Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!"<br>&nbsp;Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."<br></p><p>Much I marveled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,<br>Though its answer little meaning&#x2014; little relevancy bore;<br>For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being<br>Ever yet was blest with seeing bird above his chamber door &#x2014;<br>Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,<br>&nbsp;With such name as "Nevermore."<br></p><p>But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only<br>That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.<br>Nothing further then he uttered&#x2014; not a feather then he fluttered &#x2014;<br>Till I scarcely more than muttered, "other friends have flown before &#x2014;<br>On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before."<br>&nbsp;Then the bird said, "Nevermore."<br></p><p>Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,<br>"Doubtless," said I, "what it utters is its only stock and store,<br>Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster<br>Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore &#x2014;<br>Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore<br>&nbsp;Of 'Never &#x2014; nevermore'."<br></p><p>But the Raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,<br>Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;<br>Then upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking<br>Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore &#x2014;<br>What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore<br>&nbsp;Meant in croaking "Nevermore."<br></p><p>This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing<br>To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;<br>This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining<br>On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamplight gloated o'er,<br>But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o'er,<br>&nbsp;She shall press, ah, nevermore!<br></p><p>Then methought the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer<br>Swung by Seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor.<br>"Wretch," I cried, "thy God hath lent thee &#x2014;

This is a disturbing, well-researched wake-up call for improving the current system of drug supply and manufacturing.Several decades ago, penicillin, vitamin C, and many other prescription and over-the-counter products were manufactured in the United States. But with the rise of globalization, antibiotics, antidepressants, birth control pills, blood pressure medicines, cancer drugs, among many others are made in China and sold in the United States. China&#39;s biggest impact on the US drug supply is making essential ingredients for thousands of medicines found in American homes and used in hospital intensive care units and operating rooms. The authors convincingly argue that there are at least two major problems with this scenario. First, it is inherently risky for the United States to become dependent on any one country as a source for vital medicines, especially given the uncertainties of geopolitics. For example, if an altercation in the South China Sea causes military personnel to be wounded, doctors may rely upon medicines with essential ingredients made by the adversary. Second, lapses in safety standards and quality control in Chinese manufacturing are a risk. Citing the concerns of FDA officials and insiders within the pharmaceutical industry, the authors document incidents of illness and death caused by contaminated medications that prompted reform. This probing book examines the implications of our reliance on China on the quality and availability of vital medicines.</p><p><b>Rosemary Gibson</b> has been credited with creating national movements for safer, more humane health care. Her first book, <i>Wall of Silence</i>, with co-author Janardan Prasad Singh, put a human face on medical mistakes, launching a national campaign to improve the safety of America's health care. Gibson worked with Bill Moyers on the PBS documentary <i>On Our Own Terms</i>. She is a recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine and is also the founding editor of a narrative series in the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) Internal Medicine</i>. She is senior advisor at the Hastings Center and the 2014 winner of the highest honor from the American Medical Writers Association. She is also the author, with Janardan P. Singh, of three other books on health care. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Janardan Prasad Singh</b> is economic advisor at the World Bank. He designs strategies to strengthen economic development, health care, global trade, and national security for countries around the world. He has served as an advisor to prime ministers of India on national security affairs. Formerly, he was a member of the Board of Contributors of the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>.Preface<br><br>If you take a prescription drug, over-the-counter medicine, or vitamin, this book is for you. It reveals a dramatic shift in where the medicines&nbsp;in your kitchen cabinet or desk at work are made. The mainstream media has virtually ignored this shift, and their silence has kept you in the dark.<br><br>Antibiotics, chemotherapies, antidepressants, HIV/AIDS drugs, medicines for Alzheimer&#x2019;s and Parkinson&#x2019;s diseases, and birth control pills made in China are now sold in the United States. People taking them don&#x2019;t know it, and neither do the physicians who prescribe them.<br><br>China&#x2019;s biggest footprint, though, is making the key ingredients in prescription drugs and over-the-counter products. It is the dominant world supplier of the essential ingredients needed to make thousands of medicines found in American homes and used in hospital intensive care units and operating rooms.&nbsp;<br><br>Why is this a problem? Because we trust blindly, unquestioningly, the purity of the medicine we take. We place medicine in our mouths, inject it, or wear patches so it seeps into our bloodstreams. Our medicine becomes a part of us. A poorly made athletic shoe is not a matter of life or death. But a poorly made drug could be the difference between life and death for those who take it. With medicine, there is no room for error. And it better be available when we need it.<br><br>Worldwide dependence on a single country for life-saving medicines is breathtaking. &#x201c;Without question, if China stopped exporting ingredients, within months the world&#x2019;s pharmacies would be pretty empty,&#x201d; says Guy Villax, chief executive officer of Hovione&#x2122;, a Portuguese pharmaceutical company. Surgeries would be canceled, cancer treatments halted, kidney dialysis rationed. Infections would spread.<br><br>China is the dominant global supplier of the essential ingredients to make penicillin. The United States doesn&#x2019;t make penicillin anymore. The last penicillin fermentation plant phased out production in 2004. European and Indian plants have shuttered. <br><br>When it comes to treating anthrax, &#x201c;China is the largest exporter, head and shoulders above everybody else,&#x201d; of the building block to make ciprofloxacin, an anthrax antidote, says Bharat Mehta, cofounder of PharmaCompass.com, the largest open-access global pharmaceutical database. <br><br>Medicines manufactured in Canada, Europe, India, and other countries are made with active ingredients from China, and the finished drugs make their way to the United States and elsewhere. <br><br>If a global shortage occurs, countries will queue up and compete for available supplies. Countries without strong safety rules are more at risk of buying contaminated and ineffective medicines.<br><br>For an idea of how China might leverage our dependence, consider what happened in 2010 when China, the dominant global producer of rare earth metals, allegedly halted shipments to Japan. Toyota�, one of Japan&#x2019;s biggest carmakers, depends on rare earth metals to make its popular hybrid cars. China reportedly didn&#x2019;t end the embargo until Japan released the captain of a Chinese fishing boat that had collided with Japanese coast guard vessels in the East China Sea. <br><br>The world can do without hybrid cars for a while, but in a public health emergency there is no time to wait for medicines.<br><br>Despite the national security risk our dependence on China represents, US pharmaceutical companies have advocated for making it easier for the Department of Veterans Affairs to buy drugs made in China. Even now, if an altercation in the South China Sea causes Americans to be wounded, military doctors may have to rely on medicines with essential ingredients made by the adversary.<br><br><i>China Rx</i> is the story of America&#x2019;s reliance on China for essential drugs, how the country became dependent, the risks of dependence,&nbsp;and solutions to ensure self-sufficiency. We were inspired to write <i>China Rx</i> while in a Starbucks&#x2122; two blocks from the White House, reading an online story in an Indian newspaper about India&#x2019;s dependence on China for essential ingredients in antibiotics. India&#x2019;s national security advisor warned of the risk of a severe shortage if any tension arises between the two countries.<br><br>As we talked about whether America might also be dependent upon China, we saw a man sitting next to us popping a pill while sipping his coffee. We had seen him there before and knew he worked in the White House. We leaned over and asked him what he was taking. &#x201c;An antibiotic for strep throat,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;What would you think if that pill was made in China?&#x201d; we asked. He shook his head in disbelief, mumbling, &#x201c;Is it safe?&#x201d; We wanted to find the answer.<br><br>We wrote this book because everyone affected by outsourcing decisions should be able to find out where his or her medicines come from, and if they are made to the highest standards.<br><br>This book scratches the surface of a multibillion-dollar marketplace remarkable for its lack of transparency. We were able to piece together information from federal government documents, industry press releases, media reports, and scientific articles. Many people we interviewed are employed in the industry or government, and others are retired. Some understandably wish to remain anonymous, so we use pseudonyms for them.<br><br>We wrote <i>China Rx </i>in the public interest, not for any special interest. It tells a human story of the impact of globalization and de facto deregulation of the safety and security of America&#x2019;s medicines. We hope the book, with its landmark investigative research, increases public awareness about where America&#x2019;s medicines come from and the risks.<br><br><i>China Rx</i> raises more questions than it answers. We invite policy makers, public interest organizations, and journalists to build on this foundation and delve deeper into the vast array of topics that we have only touched upon.<br><br>When we mentioned to colleagues and friends that we were writing this book, one of the most frequent questions we heard was, &#x201c;Why are we buying drugs from China? Can&#x2019;t we make them here?&#x201d; Others responded with resignation, saying, &#x201c;Well, everything else comes from there.&#x201d;<br><br>Many companies say they are trying to reduce their exposure to foreign sourcing but can&#x2019;t find products made in the United States. We have been heartened by a small number of industry players who want to ensure the country has a basic level of manufacturing capacity to make essential medicines. Jobs will return, communities will be revitalized, doctors and the public will have greater confidence in medicines, and the nation&#x2019;s security will be strengthened.<br><br>We hope<i> China Rx </i>stimulates public policies and private initiatives to achieve these noble aims. It won&#x2019;t be easy, but with a spirit of optimism and determination, what seems impossible is possible. And it&#x2019;s the right thing to do.<br><br>Rosemary Gibson <br>Janardan Prasad Singh</p><h2>When There Is No Doctor: Preventive and Emergency Healthcare in Challenging Times (Process Self-reliance Series)</h2><p><p>The fifth title in Process&#x2019; Self-Reliance series demystifies medical practices with a practical approach to twenty-first-century health and home medicine, particularly helpful in a financial downturn.</p><p><i>When There Is No Doctor </i>is smartly designed and full of medical tips and emergency suggestions.

But millions of people suffer from Sensory Defensive Disorder (SD), a common affliction in which people react to harmless stimuli not just as a distracting hindrance, but a potentially dangerous threat.Sharon Heller, Ph.D. is not only a trained psychologist, she is sensory defensive herself. Bringing both personal and professional perspectives, Dr. Heller is the ideal person to tell the world about this problem that will only increase as technology and processed environments take over our lives. In addition to heightening public awareness of this prevalent issue, Dr. Heller provides tools and therapies for alleviating and, in some cases, even eliminating defensiveness altogether.</p><p>Until now, the treatment for sensory defensiveness has been successfully implemented in Learning Disabled children in whom defensiveness tends to be extreme. However, the disorder has generally been unidentified in adults who think they are either overstimulated, stressed, weird, or crazy. These sensory defensive sufferers live out their lives stressed and unhappy, never knowing why or what they can do about it. Now, with<em> Too Loud, Too Bright, Too Fast, Too Tigh</em>t, they have a compassionate spokesperson and a solution&#x2013;oriented book of advice.</p><p></p></p><p><p>Sharon Heller, Ph.D., is the author of <em>The Vital Touch</em> and teaches courses in psychology. She received her master's degree from the University of Chicago and her doctorate from Loyola University of Chicago. She lives in South Florida.</p>Heller, a developmental psychologist, knows firsthand how difficult life can be for people suffering from sensory defensiveness (SD). Symptoms include flinching from touch; overly acute senses of smell; fear of escalators; irritation at certain lights; and eating disorders. While these symptoms are often present from birth, for many other people they can be triggered by some traumatic event. Adding to the pain is the difficulty in diagnosing this ailment-some sufferers are told they have ADD or autism. Heller briefly discusses her own successful therapy and how it transformed her life. The book includes four sections-the first two focus on an overview of the condition, and the second two examine treatment, including diet, medication and relaxation techniques. Useful appendices list alternative treatments and resources. The writing is clear and relatively jargon-free, and sprinkled throughout the book are anecdotes from patients who have successfully battled SD. Patients who have this condition will find this book reassuring, especially since Heller discusses a treatment and usually follows up with a real-life scenario. For example, the section on light therapy ends with a success story of a woman who had learned to cope with her light sensitivity: "[Anna] realized that her eyes were wide open, no longer slits. She had spent years walking around in a haze, blinded by glare, with her brain taking in only a sliver of light." For people with SD, this title will wonderfully supplement their medical treatment. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Blueprint: How the Democrats Won Colorado (and Why Republicans Everywhere Should Care)</h2><p>Through the microcosm of Colorado&#39;s stunning political transformation, this is an inside look at the rapidly-changing business of campaigns and elections.

Her testimony before investigating committees revealed the extent to which communist infiltration had taken place in America, particularly among teachers in schools and colleges. This record of her life describes how she came to be a member of the Communist Party, the reasons for her gradual disillusionment and final break with the party, and her eventual return to the Catholic Church into which she was born.</p> <p>Her conversion to Communism was a slow usurpation of the mind by an appeal to love of humanity, a vision of a better society, and wider social justice. In time she became a member of the Party&#x2019;s National Committee, and was intensely active in combating the Rapp-Coudert investigation of communist teachers, in supporting Loyalist Spain, and in the &#x201c;united democratic front&#x201d; maintained during World War II. But she was gradually repelled by the dictatorial methods of the Party and the constant struggle for power. Her divorce from her husband, and her own ill health speeded her estrangement from Party leaders and resulted in her expulsion from the Party in 1949.</p> <p>Dodd&#x2019;s re-entrance into the Catholic Church&#x2014;which as a communist she had so bitterly attacked&#x2014;was a natural result of her new state of mind. In the early 1950s, she provided detailed explanations of the Communist subversion of the Church, reporting that &#x201c;in the 1930s we put eleven hundred men into the priesthood in order to destroy the Church from within, [and that] right now they are in the highest places in the Church.&#x201d; From such positions they were working to bring about change in order to weaken the Church&#x2019;s effectiveness against Communism. She said further that these changes would be so drastic that &#x201c;you will not recognize the Catholic Church.&#x201d;</p> <p>Bella Dodd&#x2019;s story is a human document of immense importance to Americans today. Here are the inner workings of the Communist Party in the United States in the early to mid-20th century as seen from the secret counsels and strategy meetings of the National Committee, to which she belonged for a crucial span of years. The climax of the book is a snowy Christmas Eve when Bella finds the reaffirmation of her faith, and is able to say, &#x201c;I have learned from bitter experience that you cannot serve man unless you first serve God in sincerity and truth.&#x201d; Not being able to secure her baptismal certificate from Italy after inquiry, she was baptized by Bishop Fulton J.

No part of this excerpt may be reproduced or reprinted without permission in writing from the publisher.</p><p><b>EVIDENCE&#x2013;BASED PRACTICE: AN EXPANDED DEFINITION</b></p><p>It sometimes seems as though evidence&#x2013;based practice (EBP) is taking over the world. EBP is a key topic of discussion (and controversy) in fields as diverse as clinical laboratory science (e.g., McQueen, 2001), nursing (e.g., Rutledge, 2005), physical medicine and rehabilitation (e.g., Cicerone, 2005), occupational therapy (e.g., Tse, Lloyd, Penman, King, &amp; Bassett, 2004), psychology (e.g., Wampold, Lichtenberg, &amp; Waehler, 2005), psychiatry (e.g., Hamilton, 2005), and education (e.g., Odom, Brantlinger, Gersten, Horner, Thompson, &amp; Harris, 2005). Sessions on EBP began appearing on the program of the annual convention of the American Speech&#x2013;Language&#x2013;Hearing Association (ASHA) in 1999, and the move toward EBP has been endorsed in an ASHA technical report (ASHA, 2004) and position statement (ASHA, 2005a). An evidence&#x2013;based orientation can even be found in a book about the success that resulted for a baseball team when prospective players were evaluated with objective performance measures in addition to the subjective impressions of baseball scouts (Lewis, 2003).</p><p>Its rapid spread notwithstanding, EBP has generated negative as well as positive reactions. Most criticisms can be traced to several problems with the way that the phrase has come to be understood. One problem is that the EBP "movement" seems to imply that until EBP came along, practitioners were basing their clinical decisions on something other than evidence, which is simply not true. In addition, most people seem to think that EBP involves only research evidence, which also is not true. Sackett, Rosenberg, Gray, Haynes, and Richardson (1996) originally defined <i>evidence&#x2013;based medicine</i> as "�&#x20ac;� the conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients �&#x20ac;� [by] integrating individual clinical expertise with the best available external clinical evidence from systematic research" (p. 71). Both research evidence and clinical expertise were a part of this original definition, and a third component (the patient's perspective) was added to the subsequent definition of EBP as ". . . the integration of best research evidence with clinical expertise and patient values" (Sackett, Straus, Richardson, Rosenberg, &amp; Haynes, 2000, p. 1). Despite the inclusion of clinical expertise and patient values in definitions of EBP, it is clear that the emphasis on scientific evidence has overshadowed the other two components.</p><p>As a way of bringing all three components into focus, I'd like to suggest that we think of EBP as requiring not one but three kinds of evidence, and the abbreviation E3BP will be used to help keep all three types of evidence in mind. Accordingly, the definitions discussed previously will be adapted (Sackett et al., 1996, 2000), and in this handbook we will define<i> E3BP</i> as the conscientious, explicit, and judicious integration of 1) best available <i>external</i> evidence from systematic research, 2) best available evidence <i>internal</i> to clinical practice, and 3) best available evidence concerning the preferences of a fully informed patient.</p><p>This definition will allow us to circumvent several criticisms and confusions that have bedeviled the previous concept of evidence&#x2013;based practice and its progenitor, evidence&#x2013;based medicine (e.g., Cohen, Stavri, &amp; Hersch, 2004; Rees, 2000). For one thing, the definition of E3BP clearly distinguishes between external and internal sources of strong evidence and highlights the importance of both for clinical decision making. Evidence internal to clinical practice with a particular patient is an important complement to external evidence from systematic research because although high&#x2013;quality external evidence can reveal valuable information about average patterns of performance across groups of patients, its applicability to an individual patient is unknown (Bohart, 2005). Conversely, high&#x2013;quality internal evidence from clinical practice with an individual patient is surely relevant to making decisions about that patient (Guyatt et al., 2000), although its applicability to other patients or groups of patients is likewise unknown.</p><p>Those who work in behavioral sciences, and especially in communication sciences and disorders, have an advantage when it comes to obtaining strong internal evidence because of experience with well&#x2013;developed single&#x2013;subject methodologies (e.g., Horner, Carr, Halle, McGee, Odom, &amp; Wolery, 2005) for measuring change in individual patients. Although the need for such methods is clear, Sackett et al. (2000) acknowledged that the use of such methods in medicine is in its infancy. The expanded definition emphasizes that strong evidence internal to clinical practice can and must be incorporated to make E3BP a reality in communication disorders.</p><p>Finally, E3BP also requires strong evidence about our patients' beliefs, preferences, hopes, and fears (e.g., McMurtry &amp; Bultz, 2005) concerning the clinical options that face them. To paraphrase Sullivan (2003, p. 1595), "facts known only by practitioners need to be supplemented by values known only by patients." Incorporating this third type of evidence requires that we develop a shared understanding of our clients' perspectives, as well as ensuring that clients comprehend their clinical alternatives so that they can express meaningful preferences.</p><p>You may have noticed that the expanded definition of E3BP does not refer specifically to clinical expertise, which was a key component of the original definitions by Sackett et al. (1996, 2000). That is because in my view clinical expertise is not a separate piece of the E3BP puzzle but rather the glue by which the best available evidence of all three kinds is integrated in providing optimal clinical care.</p><p><b>PRECONDITIONS TO E3BP</b></p><p>According to this expanded definition, successful E3BP has three preconditions: </p><ol><li>Uncertainty about whether a clinical action is optimal for a client<br><br></li><li>Professional integrity (comprising honesty, respectfulness, awareness of one's biases, and openness to the need to change one's mind)<br><br></li><li>Application of four principles that underpin clinical ethical reasoning: beneficence (maximizing benefit), nonmaleficence (minimizing harm), autonomy (self&#x2013;determination), and justice (fairness) </li></ol><p></p><p>Thus, E3BP requires honest doubt about a clinical issue, awareness of one's own biases, a respect for other positions, a willingness to let strong evidence alter what is already known, and constant mindfulness of ethical responsibilities to patients (e.g., Kaldjian, Weir, &amp; Duffy, 2005; Miller, Rosenstein, &amp; DeRenzo, 1998). </p><p>The crucial role of uncertainty in E3BP is worth emphasizing. Seeking evidence not in an effort to reduce honest uncertainty but rather in an effort to prove what one already believes is contrary to the fundamental thrust of E3BP. It is also likely to be a waste of time, because any contradictory evidence will be ignored or discounted in favor of evidence that supports one's point of view.</p><p>Awareness of the powerful and distorting effects of subjective bias has been a major impetus for the evidence&#x2013;based orientation. All people have biases or preconceived notions that frame, organize, and often simplify their perception of the world. Francis Bacon was one of the first to address the ways in which biases can weaken the ability to seek, recognize, and acknowledge strong evidence.</p>"The human understanding, once it has adopted opinions, either because they were already accepted and believed, or because it likes them, draws everything else to support and agree with them. And though it may meet a greater number and weight of contrary instances, it will, with great and harmful prejudice, ignore or condemn or exclude them by introducing some distinction, in order that the authority of those earlier assumptions may remain intact and unharmed."(1620, cited in Meehl, 1997a, p. 94) In short, our strong preference for what we already believe to be true makes us poor judges of whether it actually is true. <p>How important is it to test the validity of subjective beliefs? That depends at least partly on their consequences. Testing the validity of a personal belief (say, in the existence of extraterrestrials) is not important if that belief has no impact on other people. But when a belief has the potential to harm other people, testing its validity is imperative. Meehl (1997a) provided an example in his description of the <i>Malleus Malleficarum</i>, a book published in 1487 that addressed an important diagnostic problem at the time: how to identify witches. Meehl noted that its authors were respected experts who grounded their detailed list of diagnostic indicators firmly in what was known at that time&#x2014;that witches existed, that they were dangerous, and that they needed to be identified in order to protect innocent people. Despite the authors' good intentions, of course, their work actually led to enormous harm for many innocent people who were diagnosed as witches and then treated by drowning, burning at the stake, and so forth. Only when these widely accepted, expert views about witches were tested using more objective criteria did belief in them gradually wane.</p><p>As many have noted (e.g., Barrett&#x2013;Connor, 2002; Meehl, 1997a; Sackett, Haynes, Guyatt, &amp; Tugwell, 1991), it is not difficult to find more recent examples of clinical recommendations that, although based on the beliefs and good intentions of experts, turned out to be ineffective or even harmful when subjected to rigorous scientific testing. The newspaper this week probably contained at least one such report. Growing awareness of the limitations of subjective beliefs, even from experts, as a basis for decisions about patients' lives explains why external evidence from scientific research is one of the three cornerstones of EBP. Although complete objectivity may be an unrealistic goal (e.g., Hegelund, 2005), the idea that evidence should be as free as possible from the distorting effects of an observer's subjective bias(es) or expectations is one of the most important contributions of the evidence&#x2013;based perspective.</p><p>The significance of avoiding subjective biases, especially when they might result in harm, also is related to four principles of clinical ethical reasoning (e.g., Kaldjian, Weir, &amp; Duffy, 2005). The principle of <i>beneficence</i> obligates us to practice in a manner that is maximally beneficial to our patients. The principle of <i>nonmaleficence</i> obligates us to avoid harming our patients. The principle of <i>autonomy</i> (a relatively recent addition in the literature on medical ethics) obliges us to respect the right of patients to have the power to determine what happens to them based on a full understanding of the risks and benefits of the options that face them. The principle of <i>justice</i> obliges us to practice in a fair, nondiscriminatory manner. You might be familiar with these principles in connection with the protection of human subjects in research because balancing potential benefits and harms is a topic of well&#x2013;publicized discussion when participants are harmed by research. However, these same principles apply to the protection of patients during clinical practice, and they can be particularly helpful in situations in which the best available evidence from external research, from clinical practice, and from a fully informed patient does not converge neatly on the same clinical decision.</p><p><b>ORIGINS AND EVOLUTION OF EVIDENCE&#x2013;BASED PRACTICE</b></p><p>With the definition and preconditions of E3BP in mind, it is time for some historical context. How and why did the evidence&#x2013;based orientation originate? The enormous increase in research literature, in medicine, and in other fields was one major impetus (Sackett et al., 2000). For example, a recent search for information on communication disorders in PubMed, an electronic database, yielded a total of nearly 40,000 citations, and about 8,000 of these were to articles published in the past 5 years. The sheer number of publications presents practitioners with a serious challenge in finding and using the information they need in making decisions about their patients' health. One of the original goals of evidence&#x2013;based medicine was to assist practitioners in rapidly finding and using the wheat available in the literature and spending a minimum amount of time with the chaff.</p><p>The evidence&#x2013;based framework has also been compelled by the lack of unanimity that is a common feature of the research literature concerning a particular clinical question. Because findings, conclusions, and clinical implications from different studies often vary, clinicians needed a systematic, defensible, and practicable process for deciding which external evidence should carry the most weight in their decision making. This need has resulted in more than 100 systems for rating external evidence (Lohr, 2004). All such evidence&#x2013;ranking schemes involve a set of criteria for evaluating the quality of evidence so that the best current external evidence can be identified readily, consistently, and transparently.</p><p><b>Rating External Evidence: The Oxford Hierarchy</b></p><p>One of the first, most comprehensive, and most influential systems for rating evidence is the Oxford Centre for Evidence&#x2013;Based Medicine Levels of Evidence (Phillips et al., 2001; http://www.cebm.net/levels_of_evidence.asp). One of the strengths of the Oxford system is its explicit acknowledgment that no single set of criteria applies to every kind of evidence, and different rating criteria are needed according to whether evidence concerns treatment, prognosis, diagnosis/screening, differential diagnosis, and health care economics.</p><p>The working group responsible for the Oxford system characterized it as a work in progress and acknowledged one weakness of the system&#x2014;its emphasis on the internal validity of external evidence and particularly on research design as the primary basis for assigning evidence to a level. As shown in Table 1.1, for example, evidence concerning therapy that was derived from expert opinion without critical appraisal, or by induction or inference alone, is ranked lowest (Level 5) because of its potential to be affected by subjective bias and other sources of error. At the other end of the hierarchy (Level 1a) is evidence that has been found consistently across multiple studies conducted so as to minimize the potential for results to be contaminated by subjective bias or other sources of error.</p><p>Although these "quality extremes" are easy to recognize, most empirical evidence falls somewhere in&#x2013;between, and the characteristics that distinguish among the intermediate levels are not always transparent. Research design (i.e., whether a study is a randomized controlled trial, a cohort study, a case study, and so forth) is the most salient factor that differentia...</p></p><h2>A Wrinkle in Time: The Graphic Novel</h2><p><p>The world already knows Meg and Charles Wallace Murry, Calvin O'Keefe, and the three Mrs--Who, Whatsit, and Which--the memorable and wonderful characters who fight off a dark force and save our universe in the Newbery award-winning classic <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i>. But in 50 years of publication, the book has never been illustrated. Now, Hope Larson takes the classic story to a new level with her vividly imagined interpretations of tessering and favorite characters like the Happy Medium and Aunt Beast. Perfect for old fans and winning over new ones, this graphic novel adaptation is a must-read.</p></p><p><p>Madeleine L'Engle (1918-2007) was the author of many acclaimed books for children.</p><p>Hope Larson is the author of <i>Salamander Dream</i>,<i> Gray Horses</i>,<i> Chiggers</i>, and <i>Mercury</i>. She won a 2007 Eisner Award. She lives in Los Angeles, California.</p>*Starred Review* Commemorating its fiftieth anniversary, L&#x2019;Engle&#x2019;s classic couldn&#x2019;t have scored a better talent to adapt its story into comics form. Larson produces high-quality coming-of-age stories featuring female protagonists, with the most recent (Mercury, 2010) even including a fantasy element to highlight the tale&#x2019;s emotional stakes. She dives wholeheartedly into L&#x2019;Engle&#x2019;s seminal epic, chronicling the journey of Meg Murry, her preternaturally intelligent younger brother, Charles, and their friend Calvin O&#x2019;Keefe, crossing distant worlds to save the Murry&#x2019;s, lost patriarch. Guided by three grandmotherly guardian angels, they navigate the dangers of a mind-controlled world fallen under the influence of a cosmic force of pure evil. Larson has miraculously preserved the power of the original&#x2019;s social and religious themes, as well as its compelling emotional core, while staying true to her distinctive voice and aesthetic. Her soft-lined, large-eyed characters are a modern exemplar of classical American cartooning, and the metallic blue coating of the pages evokes both the timelessness of the story and the remoteness of alien worlds. This adaptation is fabulous for presenting a fresh vision to those familiar with the original, but it&#x2019;s so true to the story&#x2019;s soul that even those who&#x2019;ve never read it will come away with a genuine understanding of L&#x2019;Engle&#x2019;s ideas and heart.

Then I slam my boot down on my electric skateboard. The board is old and used, like everything else I own, its blue paint almost entirely scraped off to reveal cheap silver plastic underneath&#x2014;but it&#x2019;s not dead yet, and when I push my heel down harder, it finally responds, jerking me forward as I squeeze between two rows of cars. My bright, rainbow-dyed hair whips across my face.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hey!&#x201d; a driver yells as I maneuver past his car. I glance over my shoulder to see him waving a fist at me through his open window. &#x201c;You almost clipped me!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I just turn back around and ignore him. Usually, I&#x2019;m a nicer person than this&#x2014;or, at least, I would have shouted an apology back. But this morning, I&#x2019;d woken up to a yellow paper taped to the door of my apartment, its words printed in the largest font you can imagine.<br> &nbsp;<br> 72 HOURS TO PAY OR VACATE<br> &nbsp;<br> Translation: I&#x2019;m almost three months behind on my rent. So, unless I can get my hands on $3,450, I&#x2019;ll be homeless and in the streets by the end of the week.<br> &nbsp;<br> That&#x2019;d put a damper on anyone&#x2019;s day.<br> &nbsp;<br> My cheeks sting from the wind. The sky beyond the cut of skyscrapers is gray, turning grayer, and in a few hours this flurry of snow will become a steady fall. Cars jam the streets, a nonstop trail of brake lights and honking from here all the way to Times Square. The occasional scream of a traffic controller&#x2019;s whistle cuts above the chaos. The air is thick with the smell of exhaust, and steam billows from an open vent nearby. People swarm up and down the sidewalks. Students coming home from school are easy to spot, their backpacks and fat headphones dotting the crowds.<br> &nbsp;<br> Technically, I should be one of them. This should have been my first year of college. But I started skipping classes after Dad died and dropped out entirely several years ago. (Okay, fine&#x2014;technically, I was expelled. But I swear I would&#x2019;ve quit anyway. More on that later.)<br> &nbsp;<br> I look down at my phone again, my mind returning to the hunt. Two days ago, I had gotten the following text message:<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>New York Police Department ALERT!</i><br><i> Arrest warrant out for Martin Hamer.</i><br><i> Payment $5,000.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> The police are so busy these days with the increasing crime in the streets that they don&#x2019;t have time to hunt for petty criminals on their own&#x2014;petty criminals like Martin Hamer, who&#x2019;s wanted for gambling on Warcross, stealing money, and allegedly selling drugs to fund his bets. So, about once a week, the cops send out a message like this, a promise to pay anyone who can catch the criminal in question.<br> &nbsp;<br> That&#x2019;s where I come in. I&#x2019;m a bounty hunter, one of many in Manhattan, and I&#x2019;m fighting to capture Martin Hamer before another hunter can.<br> &nbsp;<br> Anyone who&#x2019;s ever fallen on hard times will understand the nearly constant stream of numbers that run through my mind. A month&#x2019;s rent in the worst apartment in New York: $1,150. A month&#x2019;s food: $180. Electricity and internet: $150. Boxes of macaroni, ramen, and Spam left in my pantry: 4. And so on. On top of that, I owe $3,450 in unpaid rent, and $6,000 in credit card debt.<br> &nbsp;<br> The number of dollars left in my bank account: $13.<br> &nbsp;<br> Not the normal things a girl my age worries about. I should be freaking out over exams. Turning in papers. Waking up on time.<br> &nbsp;<br> But I haven&#x2019;t exactly had a normal adolescence.<br> &nbsp;<br> Five thousand dollars is easily the largest bounty in months. For me, it might as well be all the money in the world. So, for the last two days, I&#x2019;ve done nothing but track this guy. I&#x2019;ve lost four bounties in a row this month. If I lose this one, too, I&#x2019;m going to be in real trouble.<br> &nbsp;<br> Tourists always clogging up the streets, I think as a detour forces me down a path right into Times Square, where I get stuck behind a cluster of auto-taxis jammed at a pedestrian walkway. I lean back on my board, pull myself to a halt, and start inching backward. As I go, I glance down at my phone again.<br> &nbsp;<br> A couple of months ago, I&#x2019;d succeeded in hacking into the main directory of Warcross players in New York and synced it all up to my phone&#x2019;s maps. It&#x2019;s not hard, not if you remember that everyone in the world is connected in some way to everyone else. It&#x2019;s just time-consuming. You worm your way into one account, then branch out to their friends, then their friends, and eventually, you&#x2019;re able to track the location of any player in New York City. Now I&#x2019;ve finally managed to place my target&#x2019;s physical location, but my phone&#x2019;s a cracked, beat-up old thing, with an antique battery that&#x2019;s on its last legs. It keeps trying to sleep in order to save energy, and the screen is so dark I can barely see anything.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Wake up,&#x201d; I mutter, squinting at the pixels.<br> &nbsp;<br> Finally, the poor phone lets out a pitiful buzz, and the red location marker updates on my map.<br> &nbsp;<br> I make my way out of the taxi jam and push my heel down on my board. It protests for a moment, but then it speeds me forward, a dot in a sea of moving humanity.<br> &nbsp;<br> Once I reach Times Square, screens tower above me, surrounding me in a world of neon and sound. Every spring, the official Warcross Championships kick off with a huge ceremony, and two teams of top-ranking players compete in an all-stars opening round of Warcross. This year&#x2019;s opening ceremony happens tonight in Tokyo&#x2014;so all the screens are Warcross-related today, showing a frenzied rotation of famous players, commercials, and footage of highlights from last year. Frankie Dena&#x2019;s latest, craziest music video plays on the side of one building. She&#x2019;s dressed like her Warcross avatar&#x2014;in a limited edition suit and webbed glitter cape&#x2014;and dancing with a bunch of businessmen in bright pink suits. Underneath the screen, a group of excited tourists stop to pose for photos with some guy dressed in fake Warcross gear.<br> &nbsp;<br> Another screen features five of the superstar players competing in tonight&#x2019;s opening ceremony. Asher Wing. Kento Park. Jena MacNeil. Max Martin. Penn Wachowski. I crane my neck to admire them. Each one is dressed from head to toe in the hottest fashion of the season. They smile down at me, their mouths big enough to swallow the city, and as I look on, they all hold up cans of soda, declaring Coca-Cola their drink of choice during game season. A marquee of text scrolls below them:<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Top Warcross Players Arrive in Tokyo, Poised for World Domination</i><br> &nbsp;<br> Then I&#x2019;m through the intersection and cut onto a smaller road. My target&#x2019;s little red dot on my phone shifts again. It looks like he&#x2019;s turned onto Thirty-Eighth Street.<br> &nbsp;<br> I squeeze my way through another few blocks of traffic before I finally arrive, pulling over along the curb beside a newsstand. The red location dot now hovers over the building in front of me, right above a caf�&#x2019;s door. I tug my scarf down and let out a sigh of relief. My breath fogs in the icy air. &#x201c;Caught you,&#x201d; I whisper, allowing myself a smile as I think of the five-thousand-dollar bounty. I hop off my electric skateboard, pull out its straps, and swing it over my shoulder so that it bumps against my backpack. It&#x2019;s still warm from use, the heat of it seeping through my hoodie, and I arch my back to savor it.<br> &nbsp;<br> As I pass the newsstand, I glimpse the magazine covers. I have a habit of checking them out, searching for coverage of my favorite person. There&#x2019;s always something. Sure enough, one of the magazines features him prominently: a tall young man lounging in an office, dressed in dark trousers and a crisp collar shirt, sleeves casually rolled up to his elbows, his face obscured by shadows. Below him is the logo for Henka Games, Warcross&#x2019;s parent studio. I stop to read the headline.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>HIDEO TANAKA TURNS 21 | Inside the Private Life of the Warcross Creator</i><br> &nbsp;<br> My heart skips a familiar beat at my idol&#x2019;s name. Too bad there&#x2019;s no time to stop and flip through the magazine. Maybe later. I reluctantly turn away, adjust my backpack and board higher on my shoulders, and pull my hood up to cover my head. The glass windows I pass reflect a distorted vision of myself&#x2014;face elongated, dark jeans stretched too long, black gloves, beat-up boots, faded red scarf wrapped around my black hoodie. My rainbow-colored hair spills out from underneath my hood. I try to imagine this reflected girl printed on the cover of a magazine.<br> &nbsp;<br> Don&#x2019;t be stupid. I push the ridiculous thought away as I head toward the caf�&#x2019;s entrance, shifting my thoughts instead to the running checklist of tools in my backpack.<br><br> 1. Handcuffs<br> 2. Cable launcher<br> 3. Steel-tipped gloves<br> 4. Phone<br> 5. Change of clothes<br> 6. Stun gun<br> 7. Book<br> &nbsp;<br> On one of my first hunts, my target threw up all over me after I used my stun gun (#6) on him. I started bringing a change of clothes (#5) after that. Two targets have managed to bite me, so after a few tetanus shots, I added the gloves (#3). The cable launcher (#2) is for getting to hard-to-reach places and catching hard-to-reach people. My phone (#4) is my portable hacking assistant. Handcuffs (#1) are because, well, obviously.<br> &nbsp;<br> And the book (#7) is for whenever the hunt involves a lot of waiting around. Entertainment that won&#x2019;t eat up my batteries is always worth bringing.<br> &nbsp;<br> Now I step into the caf�, soak in the warmth, and check my phone again. Customers are lined up along a counter displaying pastries, waiting for one of the four auto-cashiers to open. Decorative bookshelves line the walls. A smattering of students and tourists sit at the tables. When I point my phone&#x2019;s camera at them, I can see their names hovering over their heads, meaning none of them have set themselves on Private. Maybe my target isn&#x2019;t on this floor.<br> &nbsp;<br> I wander past the shelves, my attention shifting from table to table. Most people never really observe their surroundings; ask anyone what the person sitting at a nearby table was wearing, and chances are good that they can&#x2019;t tell you. But I can. I can recite to you the outfits and demeanor of every person in that coffee line, can tell you exactly how many people are sitting at each table, the precise way someone&#x2019;s shoulders hunch just a little too much, the two people sitting side by side who never say a word, the guy who is careful not to make eye contact with anyone else. I can take in a scene like a photographer might take in a landscape&#x2014;relax my eyes, analyze the full view all at once, search for the point of interest, and take a mental snapshot to remember the whole thing.<br> &nbsp;<br> I look for the break in the pattern, the nail that protrudes.<br> &nbsp;<br> My gaze pauses on a cluster of four boys reading on the couches. I watch them for a while, waiting for signs of conversation or the hint of notes being passed by hand or phone. Nothing. My attention goes to the stairs leading up to the second floor. No doubt other hunters are closing in on this target, too&#x2014;I have to get to him before anyone else does. My steps quicken as I climb the stairs.<br> &nbsp;<br> No one is up here, or so it seems. But then I notice the faint sound of two voices at a table in a far corner, tucked behind a pair of bookshelves that make them almost impossible to see from the stairs. I move in closer on silent feet, then peek through the shelves.<br> &nbsp;<br> A woman is seated at the table, her nose buried in a book. A man stands over her, nervously shuffling his feet. I hold up my phone. Sure enough, both of them are set to Private.<br> &nbsp;<br> I slip to the side of the wall so that they can&#x2019;t see me, and listen closely.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have until tomorrow night,&#x201d; the man is saying.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; the woman replies. &#x201c;But there&#x2019;s not much I can do. My boss won&#x2019;t release that kind of money to you without taking extra security measures, not when the police have an arrest warrant for you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You promised me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And I&#x2019;m sorry, sir.&#x201d; The woman&#x2019;s voice is calm and cynical, like she&#x2019;s had to say this countless times before. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s game season. The authorities are on high alert.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I have three hundred thousand notes with you. Do you have any idea what that&#x2019;s exchanging for?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes. It&#x2019;s my job to know,&#x201d; the woman answers in the driest voice I&#x2019;ve ever heard.<br> &nbsp;<br> Three hundred thousand notes. That&#x2019;s about two hundred thousand dollars, at the current exchange rate. High roller, this one. Gambling on Warcross is illegal in the United States; it&#x2019;s one of the many laws the government has recently passed in a desperate attempt to keep up with technology and cybercrime. If you win a bet on a Warcross match, you win game credits called notes. But here&#x2019;s the thing&#x2014;you can either take those notes online or to a physical place, where you meet a teller like this lady. You trade your notes to her. She gives you real cash in return, while taking a cut for her boss.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s my money,&#x201d; the guy is insisting now.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We have to protect ourselves. Extra security measures take time. You can come back tomorrow night, and we can exchange half of your notes.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I told you, I don&#x2019;t have until tomorrow night. I need to leave the city.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The conversation repeats itself all over again. I hold my breath as I listen. The woman has all but confirmed his identity.<br> &nbsp;<br> My eyes narrow, and my lips turn up into a hungry little smirk. This, right here, is the moment I live for during a hunt&#x2014;when the bits and pieces I&#x2019;ve exposed of a trail all converge into a fine point, when I see my target standing physically before me, ripe for the picking. When I&#x2019;ve solved the puzzle.<br> &nbsp;<br> Got you.<br> &nbsp;<br> As their conversation turns more urgent, I tap my phone twice and send out a text message to the police. <br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Suspect in physical custody. </i><br> &nbsp;<br> I get a reply almost immediately.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>NYPD ALERTED.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> I pull the stun gun out of my backpack. It catches for an instant against the edge of the zipper, making the faintest scraping sound.<br> &nbsp;<br> The conversation halts. Through the bookshelves, both the man and woman jerk their heads toward me like deer in headlights. The man sees my expression. His face is covered in a sheen of sweat, and his hair is plastered against his forehead. A fraction of a second passes.<br> &nbsp;<br> I shoot.<br> &nbsp;<br> He bolts&#x2014;I miss him by a hair. Good reflexes. The woman darts up from her table, too, but I could care less about her. I rush after him. He hops down the stairs three at a time, nearly falling in his rush, scattering his phone and a bunch of pens behind him. He sprints for the entrance as I reach the first floor. I burst through the revolving glass door right behind him.<br> &nbsp;<br> We emerge onto the street. People let out startled shouts as the man shoves them aside&#x2014;he knocks a camera-clicking tourist flat on her back. In one movement, I swing my electric board off my shoulder, drop it, jump on, and slam my heel down as har...</p><h2>Philip Glass: The Complete Piano Etudes</h2><p>(Music Sales America).

Parents everywhere became &#x201c;whisperers&#x201d; to their newborns, amazed that they could actually communicate with their baby within weeks of their child&#x2019;s birth. Tracy gave parents what for some amounted to a miracle: the ability to understand their baby&#x2019;s every coo and cry so that they could tell immediately if the baby was hungry, tired, in real distress, or just in need of a little TLC. Tracy also dispelled the insidious myth that parents must go sleepless for the first year of a baby&#x2019;s life&#x2013;because a happy baby sleeps through the night. Now you too can benefit from Tracy&#x2019;s more than twenty years&#x2019; experience. In this groundbreaking book, she shares simple, accessible programs in which you will learn: <br><br>� E.A.S.Y.&#x2013;how to get baby to eat, play, and sleep on a schedule that will make every member of the household&#x2019;s life easier and happier.<br>� S.L.O.W.&#x2013;how to interpret what your baby is trying to tell you (so you don&#x2019;t try to feed him when he really wants a nap).<br>� How to identify which type of baby yours is&#x2013;Angel, Textbook, Touchy, Spirited, or Grumpy&#x2013;and then learn the best way to interact with that type.<br>� Tracy&#x2019;s Three Day Magic&#x2013;how to change any and all bad habits (yours and the baby&#x2019;s) in just three days.<br><br>At the heart of Tracy&#x2019;s simple but profound message: treat the baby as you would like to be treated yourself. Reassuring, down-to-earth, and often flying in the face of conventional wisdom, <i>Secrets of the Baby Whisperer</i> promises parents not only a healthier, happier baby but a more relaxed and happy household as well.</p><p>The last thing new parents can find time for is quiet reading, so many helpful books on infant care rely on bullet points and a "let's get to the point" writing style. Tracy Hogg, a neonatal nurse, teacher, and mother of two, uses these techniques to good effect in <i>Secrets of the Baby Whisperer</i>. Focusing on newborns and their parents, her simple programs are a blend of intelligent intuition and methods based on years of experience. The first half of the book is devoted to E.A.S.Y--her name for creating a structured daily routine for you and your baby that makes the most of your baby's awake times and also leaves time just for you. These concepts aren't designed to force your bundle of joy into not following her body's needs, but rather to create a feasible middle ground between total rigidity and on-demand food and sleep (and no time for mom to shower). If it still strikes you as too regimented, keep reading. The author makes room for differences in personal style and includes short quizzes to determine whether you're a "planner" or a "winger", and what level of daily structure you are likely to find helpful. In the same chapter, she identifies five general temperaments of infants, how to get an accurate feel for yours, and what methods of care are likely to be the most effective for his temperament. Her statement that babies prefer routine is backed up by research from the University of Denver. While most of the book relies on anecdotes to get the points across, Hogg does find room to back up some of her statements with quotes from various researchers and institutions. Included at the end of the book are assurances that E.A.S.Y. can be followed even with a colicky baby or one who's been ruling the roost for the first few months. Frustrated parents might like to read the last page first: "all the baby-whispering advice in the world is useless unless you're having a good time being a parent" is an excellent reminder to enjoy this time with all of its ups and downs. <i>--Jill Lightner</i><b>Tracy Hogg </b>obtained her nursing degree in England, specializing in maternity and neonatal care.

From his first bestseller, <i>Sarum</i>, to the international sensation <i>London</i>, he has captivated audiences with gripping narratives that follow the fortunes of several fictional families down through the ages.&nbsp;<i>The Princes of Ireland</i>, a sweeping panorama steeped in the tragedy and glory that is Ireland, epitomizes the power and richness of Rutherfurd's storytelling magic.<br><br> The saga begins in tribal, pre-Christian Ireland during the reign of the fierce and mighty High Kings at Tara, with the tale of two lovers, the princely Conall and the ravishing Deirdre, whose travails cleverly echo the ancient Celtic legend of Cuchulainn. From that stirring beginning, Rutherfurd takes the reader on a powerfully-imagined journey through the centuries. Through the interlocking stories of a memorable cast of characters&#x2014;druids and chieftains, monks and smugglers, noblewomen and farmwives, merchants and mercenaries, rebels and cowards&#x2014;we see Ireland through the lens of its greatest city. <br><br> While vividly and movingly conveying the passions and struggles that shaped the character of Dublin, Rutherfurd portrays the major events in Irish history: The tribal culture of pagan Ireland; the mission of St. Patrick; the coming of the Vikings and the founding of Dublin; the glories of the great nearby monastery of Glendalough and the making of treasures like the Book of Kells; the extraordinary career of Brian Boru; the trickery of Henry II, which gave England its first foothold in Medieval Ireland. The stage is then set for the great conflict between the English kings and the princes of Ireland, and the disastrous Irish invasion of England, which incurred the wrath of Henry VIII and where this book, the first of the two part Dublin Saga, draws to a close, as the path of Irish history takes a dramatic and irrevocable turn.<br><br> Rich, colorful and impeccably researched, <i>The Princes of Ireland </i>is epic entertainment spun by a master.</p><p>From the internationally bestselling author of London and Sarum -- a magnificent epic about love and war, family life and political intrigue in Ireland over the course of seventeen centuries. Like the novels of James Michener, The Princes of Ireland brilliantly interweaves engrossing fiction and well-researched fact to capture the essence of a place. <br>Edward Rutherfurd has introduced millions of readers to the human dramas that are the lifeblood of history.

The Princes of Ireland, a sweeping panorama steeped in the tragedy and glory that is Ireland, epitomizes the power and richness of Rutherfurd's storytelling magic. <br>The saga begins in pre-Christian Ireland with a clever refashioning of the legend of Cuchulainn, and culminates in the dramatic founding of the Free Irish State in 1922. Through the interlocking stories of a wonderfully imagined cast of characters -- monks and noblemen, soldiers and rebels, craftswomen and writers -- Rutherfurd vividly conveys the personal passions and shared dreams that shaped the character of the country. He takes readers inside all the major events in Irish history: the reign of the fierce and mighty kings of Tara; the mission of Saint Patrick; the Viking invasion and the founding of Dublin; the trickery of Henry II, which gave England its foothold on the island in 1167; the plantations of the Tudors and the savagery of Cromwell; the flight of the "Wild Geese"; the failed rebellion of 1798; the Great Famine and the Easter Rebellion. With Rutherfurd'swell-crafted storytelling, readers witness the rise of the Fenians in the late nineteenth century, the splendours of the Irish cultural renaissance, and the bloody battles for Irish independence, as though experiencing their momentous impact firsthand. <br>Tens of millions of North Americans claim Irish descent.

Synthesizing insights from psychology, East- West philosophy, religion, metaphysics, and business, this hands-on workbook in the tradition of Julia Cameron's The Artist's Way, can teach anyone to achieve a heightened state of perceptual vitality and integrate it into daily life. Intuition, writes Penney Peirce, is "not the opposite of logic," but rather "a comprehensive way of knowing life that includes both left-brain analytical thinking and right-brain communication states." On a practical level, intuition enables us to learn faster and make quicker, more inspired decisions. On a deeper level, it "is a powerful tool that can heal the painful split we all feel between our earthly, mundane selves and our divine, eternal selves." Widely praised in its earlier editions, this new edition of The Intuitive Way, with a Foreword by Carol Adrienne, will introduce Penney Peirce's pioneering work to a whole new readership.</p><p>When intuition is in full bloom, life takes on a magical, effortless quality; your world is suddenly full of synchronicities, creative insights, and abundant knowledge. Through an easy-to-understand ten-step course, The Intuitive Way shows you how to enter that state of perceptual aliveness and integrate it into daily life to achieve greater natural flow. Author Penney Peirce synthesizes teachings from psychology, East-West philosophy, religion, metaphysics, and business. In simple and direct language, Peirce describes the intuitive process as a new way of life and demonstrates practical applications from speeding up decision-making to expanding personal growth. Whether you&#39;re just beginning to search for a richer, fuller life experience or are looking for more subtle, sophisticated insights about your spiritual path, The Intuitive Way will be your companion as you progress through the stages of intuition development toward grasping your soul&#39;s purpose.I wrote <i>The Intuitive Way</i> after over 20 years experience working with creativity, metaphysics, psychology, and cross-cultural spirituality. I've worked in business and as a professional "expert intuitive," doing thousands of intuitive consultations all over the world. In looking at what's truly valuable in life, I find that it is knowledge of the deep, inner self that leads us to an experience of connectedness/communion with the divine and with other forms of life on our planet. <br><br>Overwhelmingly, we want to know today what our life purpose is, what our real motivation is, what gives us passion. It is only through intuition, or "direct knowing," that we can discover this certainty. Intuition is both a vehicle for profound spiritual knowledge and for success and enjoyment in our ordinary, daily lives. <br><br>My book is designed to give you a thorough experience of the sequence of steps one goes through on the journey into intuitive perception. If you follow the 10 chapters and do the exercises, you will develop much greater skill and clarity. My book is different from many others currently available, in that I deal with the Hero's Journey into the underworld--as a NATURAL part of the process of intuition development,and give methods for effectively navigating the subconscious mind. <br><br>I differentiate between the intuitive process and psychism, which I believe is just a small part of intuition. My orientation is practical,friendly, mystical, and I value common sense. As I wrote <i>The Intuitive Way</i>, I had a little sign up next to my computer: "Every paragraph must be compassionate." I invite you to experience more depth in life by exploring your own wondrous, unknown regions, and by trusting your inner voice and the truth and anxiety signals you get from your body.Intuition is truly a path to an integrated, creative life.</p><h2>Bitter Harvest</h2><p><b>GIFTED WITH A BRILLIANT MIND, BLESSED WITH A BEAUTIFUL FAMILY -- AND CURSED WITH A DESTRUCTIVE MADNESS</b> <br> In this harrowing <i>New York Times</i> bestseller, Ann Rule is at her masterful best as she winnows horrific truths from the ashes of what seemed like paradise in Prairie Village, Kansas. Rule probes the case of Debora Green, a doctor and a loving mother who seemed to epitomize the dreams of the American heartland. A small-town girl with a genius IQ, she achieved an enviable life: her own medical practice, a handsome physician husband, three perfect children, and an opulent home in an exclusive Kansas City suburb. But when a raging fire destroyed that home and took two lives, the trail of clues led investigators to a stunning conclusion. Piece by piece, Ann Rule digs beneath this placid Midwestern facade to unveil a disturbing portrait of strangely troubled marriages, infidelity, desperation, suicide, and escalating acts of revenge that forever changed dozens of lives.</p><p>Fans of Ann Rule will find much to relish in <i>Bitter Harvest</i>, the tale of a brilliant Kansas physician who holds herself together well enough to put on a decent show for the outside world, but in the heart of her horror-struck family is a violent and baffling monster. She drinks, abuses drugs, spews invective, and even lights fires. At one point she learns from an Agatha Christie novel about a potent toxin contained in castor beans, and she starts poisoning her long-suffering husband. Yet until the final fire that consumes two of her children, they continue to love her and defend her to attackers. Rule tells the story with flair, conveying all of the heady feelings involved, but still the book has a flaw: Rule fails to understand the main character. When a psychiatrist testifies that the doctor is at a younger age than a toddler in her ability to process or sustain emotions, Rule writes, "That was a shocker. Could a woman with an IQ of 165 and a biting, facetious wit, a woman who had zipped through college and medical school, be a child emotionally?"Yes, she could. <i>Bitter Harvest</i> would've been a stronger book if Rule had shown us how.Ann Rule wrote thirty-five&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestsellers, all of them still in print. Her first bestseller was&nbsp;<i>The Stranger Beside Me</i>, about her personal relationship with infamous serial killer Ted Bundy. A former Seattle police officer, she used her firsthand expertise in all her books. For more than three decades, she was a powerful advocate for victims of violent crime.

We were doing some cooking but lacked that inspiration that you get from cooking for a restaurant full of people. Our GM at the time introduced us to the idea of a blog and suggested it might be something we would be interested in exploring. I checked it out first and thought it would be fun. Six years later, here we are. <p></p> <b>Who&#x2019;s your favorite author? Chef?</b><br> Aki: That&#x2019;s an impossible question because there are so many of both. Some of our favorite chefs are people we&#x2019;ve been lucky enough to work with or get to know like Tony Maws, Spike Gjerde, Wylie Dufresne, David Chang, Johnny Iuzzini, Daniel Patterson, Michael Laiskonis, Bryan and Michael Voltaggio, Marco Canora, Tony Conte, I could go on and on. Beyond that we are inspired by chefs around the world, we are inspired by reading menus and websites, places we&#x2019;ve eaten and so many different things. Frankly there&#x2019;s no list we could put together that would be long enough to cover everyone who we find inspiring although the people listed above are incredibly generous and forthcoming with their knowledge and experience and that is always a gift. <p></p> As for writers, that list is equally long. I can say that in my youth, before I ever worked in a restaurant, the writers who I read first and stayed with me the longest include MFK Fisher, Laurie Colwin, John Thorne, James Villas, John T Edge, Roy Andries de Groot, Jane Grigson, Pierre Franey, James Beard, Nicholas Freeling, Madeleine Kamman, Calvin Trilling, Raymond Sokolov and Mimi Sheraton. I&#x2019;ve always been a reader. <p></p> <b>You can only cook from three cookbooks for the rest of your life. What are they and why?</b> <br> Alex: Madeleine Kamman&#x2019;s <i>The New Making of a Chef</i>, Shirley O. Corriher&#x2019;s <i>Cookwise</i>, and to be totally immodest I would choose our book. We&#x2019;ve actually been cooking from it since we got a copy of the galley. <p></p> <b>What&#x2019;s your favorite book? Why?</b> <br> Alex: The latest edition of <i>On Food and Cooking</i> by Harold McGee. <p></p> Aki: It&#x2019;s the one book to rule them all. <p></p> <b>How do you come up with your recipes?</b><br> Alex: Recipes come together in a variety of ways and they are not always calculated. Our past, present and future are essential in directing the paths we take. Flavor memories and life experience guide our inspirations. Think about grilled lobster. I remember sea breezes and too much sun, the smell of seaweed and the aroma of drawn butter. All of these memories are touchstones in the creation of a new dish. Today we know about the different muscle fibers in a lobster and we can use this knowledge to cook each part to delicious succulence. So we combine our inspiration and technical knowledge to come up with something new and delicious. <p></p> <b>What&#x2019;s one food item or implement you couldn&#x2019;t live without?</b><br> Alex: Since there are two of us we will take salt and a sharp knife. We share pretty well. <p></p> <b>What does your kitchen look like? </b><br> Aki: It&#x2019;s a traditional home kitchen with all the usual suspects from a great coffee maker to an electric range (can&#x2019;t have gas where we live) but tucked away in what used to be our garage is our workshop and library stacked with books and more unusual cooking equipment from immersion circulators to nitrogen tanks and a CVap. <p></p> <b>What&#x2019;s your favorite childhood meal? Adult meal? </b><br> Alex: Childhood meal would be mac and cheese and my favorite adult meal would be macaroni and cheese with truffles. <p></p> Aki: I had a lot of favorite childhood meals and unsurprisingly there is a list in my head without one particular meal standing out in my mind. I was lucky to have a lot of good food in my life and for me the best meals were almost always occasions shared with people I loved and was very comfortable with so the company was as important as the food. That is equally true of my adult meals, great company can overcome bad food and the most amazing meal cannot triumph over an uncomfortable atmosphere at the table. <p></p> <b>If you could cook for one person, who would it be? </b><br> Alex: Steve Jobs <p></p> <b>What has been your biggest kitchen mishap? </b><br> Alex: Depends on the day. <p></p> <b>Fill in the blank: </b><p></p> <b>My guilty pleasure is ________</b><p></p> Alex: Starbucks Eggnog Latte <p></p> Aki: Haagen Daaz Chocolate Peanut Butter ice cream, straight from the carton with a spoon. <p></p> <b>My superpower wish is: ________</b><p></p> Alex: I would not need any sleep. That would make me a heck of a lot more productive in my day. <p></p> Aki: The ability to motivate and inspire the people around me to stay on track and not lose focus because that only makes them stronger. <p></p> <b>I need more: ________</b><p></p> Alex: Shelf Space in the kitchen to store all my junk. <p></p> Aki: Time to get things done. <p></p>AKI KAMOZAWA and H.

Now, with news that will astound her many fans, not to mention Madeline herself, she and her 11 cohorts find themselves on their way to Texas, U.S.A. Madeline a wealthy cowgirl? Why not! She handles her marvelous windfall with her usual aplomb, donning denim and boots to hop aboard a horse for a tour of her newly inherited gold mines, stampeding cattle herds, and gushing oil fields. At the end of the day, Miss Clavel prepares to tuck 12 little girls into bed--but wait... there are only 11! Where's Madeline?<p> Traditionalists need not fear that wealth will corrupt their favorite little orphan. Some surprises are still in store, even for Madeline. </p><p> While sorting through his grandfather's files, artist and writer John Bemelmans Marciano discovered the manuscript and pencil sketches for this last of the much-loved Madeline series. With great respect, Marciano completed the project with full-color paintings, and added two more of Bemelmans's holiday classics--"The Count and the Cobbler" and "Sunshine"--to create a collection no Bemelmans and Madeline devotee can do without.

(Ages 4 to 8--or all ages, of course) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p>Alas, this seems like ersatz MadelineAbut try telling that to the hordes of Madeline fans who will clamor for it. As a note explains, during the 1950s Bemelmans drafted a Madeline adventure set in Texas at Christmas and featuring the department store owned by his friend Stanley Marcus; a version was passed out to Neiman-Marcus customers, and Bemelmans abandoned the project. Here his grandson supplies his own color illustrations for the discarded text; the quantum difference between Bemelman's offhand genius and the product here is revealed with a simple comparison of sketches drawn by Bemelmans, reproduced on the back of the jacket, with the extrapolations inside. The text, clearly a work in progress, splices together a story line from Madeline and the Gypsies with a cowboy motif and a big promotion for "the world's greatest store"; the heroine, inheriting a Texas-size fortune, seems unlike the "real" Madeline ("And there'll be no more school, that is the best part./ For who is rich is already smart," opines this impostor). Two other Bemelmans tales with Christmas settings are also included, with art similarly refurbished by Marciano. Ages 5-8.

Here are courtships and legacies; the worlds of literature, theater, and the popular press; the paradoxes of temperament and the constraints of custom; the clash of conscience and desire. Stylistically, the stories allowed James to experiment with tones and devices quite different from his novels&#x2014;dramatic plot twists and surprise endings, swift pacing and ebullient humor. The brilliance of his technical command allowed him to transform the tiniest of suggestions&#x2014;a fleetingly observed gesture, an anecdote dropped at a dinner party&#x2014;into fiction remarkable for its lambent surfaces and intricate psychological counterpoint.<br><br>The twenty-one stories in this volume represent James at the peak of his storytelling powers. Among them are &#x201c;The Turn of the Screw,&#x201d; one of his most popular works, and a terrifying exercise in psychological horror centering on the corruption of childhood innocence; &#x201c;The Real Thing,&#x201d; a playful consideration of the illusion of art and the paradoxes of authenticity; &#x201c;The Figure in the Carpet,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Death of the Lion,&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Middle Years,&#x201d; three very different expositions of the mysteries of authorship, embodying some of James&#x2019;s most profound insights into the nature of his own art; &#x201c;The Altar of the Dead,&#x201d; a somber, ultimately wrenching meditation on the relation of the living to the dead; and &#x201c;In the Cage,&#x201d; an extended evocation of the inner life of a young woman trapped in a dehumanizing job at a postal-and-telegraph office.<br><br><b>LIBRARY OF AMERICA</b>&nbsp;is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation&#x2019;s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America&#x2019;s best and most significant writing.

He spent his early life in America and studied in Geneva, London and Paris during his adolescence to gain the worldly experience so prized by his father. He lived in Newport, went briefly to Harvard Law School, and in 1864 began to contribute both criticism and tales to magazines.<p>In 1869, and then in 1872-74, he paid visits to Europe and began his first novel, <b>Roderick Hudson</b>. Late in 1875 he settled in Paris, where he met Turgenev, Flaubert, and Zola, and wrote <b>The American</b> (1877). In December 1876 he moved to London, where two years later he achieved international fame with <b>Daisy Miller</b>. Other famous works include <b>Washington Square</b> (1880), <b>The Portrait of a Lady</b> (1881), <b>The Princess Casamassima</b> (1886), <b>The Aspern Papers</b> (1888), <b>The Turn of the Screw</b> (1898), and three large novels of the new century, <b>The Wings of the Dove</b> (1902), <b>The Ambassadors</b> (1903) and <b>The Golden Bowl</b> (1904). In 1905 he revisited the United States and wrote <b>The American Scene</b> (1907).</p><p>During his career he also wrote many works of criticism and travel. Although old and ailing, he threw himself into war work in 1914, and in 1915, a few months before his death, he became a British subject. In 1916 King George V conferred the Order of Merit on him.

Everitt fashions the story of Rome&#x2019;s rise to glory into an erudite page-turner filled with lasting lessons for our time. He chronicles the clash between patricians and plebeians that defined the politics of the Republic. He shows how Rome&#x2019;s shrewd strategy of offering citizenship to her defeated subjects was instrumental in expanding the reach of her burgeoning empire. And he outlines the corrosion of constitutional norms that accompanied Rome&#x2019;s imperial expansion, as old habits of political compromise gave way, leading to violence and civil war. In the end, unimaginable wealth and power corrupted the traditional virtues of the Republic, and Rome was left triumphant everywhere except within its own borders.<br> &nbsp;<br> Everitt paints indelible portraits of the great Romans&#x2014;and non-Romans&#x2014;who left their mark on the world out of which the mighty empire grew: Cincinnatus, Rome&#x2019;s George Washington, the very model of the patrician warrior/aristocrat; the brilliant general Scipio Africanus, who turned back a challenge from the Carthaginian legend Hannibal; and Alexander the Great, the invincible Macedonian conqueror who became a role model for generations of would-be Roman rulers. Here also are the intellectual and philosophical leaders whose observations on the art of government and &#x201c;the good life&#x201d; have inspired every Western power from antiquity to the present: Cato the Elder, the famously incorruptible statesman who spoke out against the decadence of his times, and Cicero, the consummate orator whose championing of republican institutions put him on a collision course with Julius Caesar and whose writings on justice and liberty continue to inform our political discourse today.<br> &nbsp;<br> Rome&#x2019;s decline and fall have long fascinated historians, but the story of how the empire was won is every bit as compelling. With <i>The Rise of Rome</i>, one of our most revered chroniclers of the ancient world tells that tale in a way that will galvanize, inform, and enlighten modern readers.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>The Rise of Rome</i></b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> &#x201c;Fascinating history and a great read.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Chicago Sun-Times</i></b><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;An engrossing history of a relentlessly pugnacious city&#x2019;s 500-year rise to empire.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2014;Kirkus Reviews</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Rome&#x2019;s history abounds with remarkable figures. . . .

The expeditionary force was there largely thanks to the machinations of three deities: Juno, the wife of the king of the gods, Jupiter; Minerva, whose specialty was wisdom; and the goddess of sexual passion, Venus. They were competing for a golden apple inscribed with the words &#x201c;A prize for the most beautiful.&#x201d; Not even their fellow gods dared to judge among these potent and easily offended creatures, and so it was decided that the poisoned choice would be handed to a mortal, a young shepherd named Paris, who tended his flock on the slopes of Mount Ida, a few miles from Troy. His only qualification appears to have been astonishing good looks, for there was nothing in his character to mark him out from the crowd.<br><br>The goddesses duly turned up without a stitch of clothing on among them. Not being above bribery, they offered, respectively, the gifts of power, of knowledge&#x2014;and of access to the most beautiful woman in the world, Helen, the queen of Sparta. Feckless and randy, Paris accepted the third offer and awarded the apple to Venus. The losers stormed off, plotting vengeance.<br><br>It transpired that Paris was actually of royal blood. His father was Priam, the king of Troy. When his mother was carrying him, she dreamed that she would give birth not to a baby but to a flaming torch. This was a serious warning from the gods of future disaster, and the couple arranged for a shepherd to leave the baby exposed on a mountainside (a regular means of eliminating unwanted infants in the classical world), to be eaten by wild animals. The shepherd didn&#x2019;t have the heart to obey, and brought the boy up himself.<br><br>Once the youth&#x2019;s true identity was revealed, his parents put the bad dream to the back of their minds and acknowledged him as their son. Priam dispatched him with a fleet to conduct a friendship tour of the isles of Greece. Paris had a better idea. He made straight for Sparta and the court of Menelaus and his wife, Helen. Helen was even more beautiful than he had imagined. While Menelaus was away on a visit to Crete, he eloped with her and sailed back to Troy with his prize.<br><br>Although Priam recognized that his son had broken the laws of hospitality by stealing another man&#x2019;s wife, he unwisely received the couple within his walls. He should have realized that he was welcoming a lighted torch into his city, just as his wife&#x2019;s dream had foretold.<br><br>The cuckolded husband&#x2019;s brother was the federal overlord of innumerable Greek statelets. Together they won the support of their fellow rulers and a combined army set off for Troy, to retrieve Helen and punish the city that had taken her in. Ten wearying years passed, full of incident but without a decisive victory for either side. The most notable event took place in the ninth year of the siege. This was a prolonged sulk by the Greeks&#x2019; greatest military asset, the youthful but hot-tempered Achilles.<br><br>A handsome redhead, he was brought up as a girl among a sister�- hood of girls, according to one tradition. This was because his mother, Thetis, a granddaughter of the sea god Poseidon (the Roman Neptune), foresaw that his fate was either to win eternal fame and die early or to live a long life in obscurity. As a loving parent, she opted for longevity. Achilles, who was given a female name, Pyrrha (Greek for &#x201c;flame-colored,&#x201d; in tribute to his hair), was pretty enough for the ruse to go undetected for some time&#x2014;until the boy got one of his fellow schoolgirls pregnant. Once permitted to be male, he rejected his mother&#x2019;s wishes and opted for glory. He soon became known as a great warrior and went happily off to fight at Troy, in the full knowledge that he would never return.<br><br>Battles in this heroic age were not fought by disciplined groups of men, according to epic poets such as Homer, but were in effect a series of simultaneous individual combats or duels between kings and noblemen. The rank and file took their cue from the success or failure of their champions. After a quarrel with the commander-in-chief, Achilles stayed in his tent and refused to join the battle. However, he allowed his dear friend, and (some said) lover, Patroclus, to borrow his armor and fight on his behalf. Patroclus was killed, and his death brought the Greek hero raging back onto the battlefield, where he dispatched Hector, Troy&#x2019;s bravest champion and Priam&#x2019;s firstborn son.<br><br>Achilles was soon dead himself, shot by an arrow from the bow of Paris. Then Paris, the cause of all this woe, was felled, the victim of another archer. The war had arrived at a stalemate.<br><br>Openhearted and fearless, honorable but unrelenting in revenge, Achilles was an iconic figure in the ancient world. Young Greeks and Romans through the centuries admired him and wanted to be like him. The Macedonian conqueror Alexander the Great kept by his bedside a copy of Homer&#x2019;s Iliad, whose unparalleled poetry celebrates the wrath of Achilles.<br><br>one morning, trojans manning the walls looked seaward and were amazed by what they saw. The Greek camp alongside the beach was deserted and the fleet was gone. It was evident that the war was over and the invaders were on their way home. The people flooded out of the city in a state of great enthusiasm. They were puzzled by the sight of an enormous wooden horse, but a Greek deserter told them that it was an offering to Minerva. Apparently, a seer had announced that if the Trojans destroyed it they would provoke her resentment, but if they brought it inside the city she would become their protector, despite the unpleasant business of the golden apple.<br><br>A few voices argued that the horse should be burned or pushed into the sea, but it was eventually decided to drag it into Troy. The city gate was too small to admit it, so part of the wall had to be knocked down to make room. The evening was given over to feasting and drinking. Sentries were not posted, and when the revelers at last went to their beds the sleeping city lay defenseless beneath the stars.<br><br>of course, the Greeks had not departed. Their fleet had harbored behind the offshore island of Tenedos, a few miles down the coast, and awaited nightfall before returning to Troy. Ulysses, the crafty ruler of Ithaca, an island in the Ionian Sea, had devised a cunning plan. The wooden horse was his idea, and it was designed with an internal compartment capable of housing twenty armed men. He briefed the soi-disant defector to tell his entirely fictional story. In the early hours, the man opened a hidden door and let out the soldiers who were locked inside. Meanwhile, a Greek force marched from the shore and entered the city without let or hindrance.<br><br>Aeneas, a member of a junior branch of the Trojan royal family and the son-in-law of Priam, had gone to sleep that night in the house of his father, Anchises, in a secluded quarter of the city. His mother was Venus, active as ever in the affairs, and the affaires de coeur, of Troy, who had seduced Anchises in his youth and detained him for nearly two weeks of nonstop lovemaking. Aeneas had a nightmare in which Achilles&#x2019; victim, his body covered with dust and blood, warned him that the city had been captured and was in flames; it was his duty to escape. He woke up to find that this was indeed the case. Climbing to the roof of the house, he saw fires blazing in every direction.<br><br>Aeneas realized that nothing could be done to reverse the catastrophe. As the dream had told him, it was his sacred obligation to lead a party of survivors, and refound Troy elsewhere. He took with him the city&#x2019;s penates, images of its household gods, and (some said) the celebrated Palladium, an ancient, sacred wooden statue of Minerva that had fallen from the sky.<br><br>The small company, which included Aeneas&#x2019;s aged father and his young son Ascanius, also known as Iulus, made its way to one of the city gates, using dark side streets and avoiding Greek marauders. The Trojan prince suddenly realized that his wife was missing, and rushed back to look for her, without success. Returning empty-handed at dawn, he was surprised to find a large crowd of refugees awaiting his orders.<br><br>According to another narrative, Aeneas was in charge of allied reinforcements that withdrew to Troy&#x2019;s citadel and prevented the enemy from taking the entire city. He created enough of a distraction to allow much of the civilian population to escape and, after negotiating a cease-fire with the Greeks, marched his people out of Troy in good order.<br><br>One way or another, a fair number of Trojans had survived, and under Aeneas&#x2019;s command a decision was taken to leave their native land forever. A fleet was built, and the party sailed away with no certain destination. The idea was to find somewhere to settle and establish a new national home.<br><br>This was more easily said than done. Abortive attempts were made to found a city in Thrace and Crete. Aeneas spent some time with a relative who had become ruler in Epirus, on the western coast of Greece, after the assassination of Achilles&#x2019; son, Pyrrhus, the country&#x2019;s brutal young king. This relative advised Aeneas to make for Italy. However, the unforgetting goddesses Juno and Minerva were determined to prevent a rebirth of the hated Troy, and Aeneas was forced to undergo many dangerous adventures. Like Ulysses before him on his long journey back to Ithaca, he had a narrow escape from the one-eyed giant Polyphemus. Finally, the Trojans were blown off course by a storm and shipwrecked on the coast of North Africa.<br><br>they found that they were not the only refugees seeking a new world. A group of Phoenician expatriates were building a settlement on a strip of coast leased from local tribes. They originated from the great island port of Tyre, in what is now Lebanon.<br><br>Tyre was a monarchy. Its unscrupulous ruler had arranged the murder of a wealthy landowner and confiscated his estates. The dead man&#x2019;s widow, Dido, assembled a large community of people who either hated or feared their king and (prompted by her husband&#x2019;s helpful ghost) unearthed a secret hoard of gold to fund her expenses. Seizing some ships in the harbor, she and her followers made good their escape.<br><br>They were building Carthage (Phoenician for &#x201c;new city&#x201d;) on part of a large promontory backed by two lagoons to the north and south when the Trojans arrived, storm-shaken, caked with brine, and exhausted. They were amazed, and doubtless a little jealous, at what they saw.<br><br>Virgil, Rome&#x2019;s national poet and the author of the Aeneid, an epic poem on the adventures of Aeneas, imagines the scene:<br><br>Aeneas looked wonderingly at the solid structures springing up where there had once been only African huts, and at the gates, the turmoil, and the paved streets. The Tyrians were hurrying about busily, some tracing a line for the walls and manhandling stones up the slopes as they strained to build their citadel, and others siting some building and marking its outline by ploughing a furrow.<br><br>Dido welcomed the strangers and, hearing their story, sympathized with Aeneas for his misfortunes. The goddess Juno now found herself in an uncomfortable position; if Aeneas could be persuaded to make Carthage his home, he would abandon the glorious future in Italy that had been prophesied for him and there would no longer be any risk of a new Troy rising from the ground. Unfortunately, though, the despised Trojan would have to marry Dido, a favorite of hers, as indeed was Carthage. This was a bitter sacrifice, but she had no choice but to make it.<br><br>Arrangements were made with the cooperation of Venus, and the queen of Carthage duly fell in love with the exile. On a hunting expedition in the hills, Juno arranged for a fortuitous thunderstorm and the couple took refuge in a cave, where nature followed its pleasant course. Dido called the encounter a wedding.<br><br>Unfortunately, a local African chieftain had had his eye on Dido for himself, and did not want to lose her. He was a great devotee of Jupiter and prayed to him for help. He complained, &#x201c;Now this second Paris, wearing a Phrygian bonnet to tie up his chin and cover his oily hair, and attended by a train of she-men, is to become the owner of what he has stolen.&#x201d;<br><br>Jupiter had known nothing of his wife&#x2019;s plot and was furious. He immediately dispatched a messenger to warn the Trojan prince to remember his destiny and leave at once for Italy. Aeneas the True (so called because of his reputation for loyalty) was thunderstruck by the rebuke and abandoned Dido without delay.<br><br>Thoroughly embarrassed, he tried to justify himself to her, placing the blame on the king of the gods. &#x201c;So stop upsetting yourself, and me too, by these protests,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It is not by my own choice that I voyage onward toward Italy.&#x201d;<br><br>Dido, spurned, chose to die. She had a great funeral pyre built, letting it be known that her purpose was to incinerate a sword Aeneas had left behind, some of his clothes, and his portrait. This was a ruse, for the pyre was for her own use. She climbed up onto it and stabbed herself. Before dying, she uttered a curse, predicting eternal enmity between her new city and the one her Trojan lover and his posterity would found in Italy:<br><br>Neither love nor compact shall there be between the nations. And from my dead bones may some avenger arise to persecute with fire and sword these settlers from Troy, soon or in after-time, whenever the strength is given! Let your shores oppose their shores, your waves their waves, your arms their arms. That is my imprecation. Let them fight, they, and their sons&#x2019; sons, for ever!<br><br>At long last, Aeneas and his companions reached Italy. As they sailed along its western coast, a large wood came into view through which the yellow waters of the river Tiber poured into the sea; and here the Trojans disembarked. Their voyage was at an end. They were greeted by Latinus, the old and henpecked king of the Latini, a tribe living between the Tiber and Anio rivers, from which Latium (today&#x2019;s Lazio) gets its name. He and his people were of Greek origin. Thanks to his wife&#x2019;s influence, his daughter Lavinia had been promised to Turnus, the young and energetic chief of the Rutulians. The king for once stood up for himself; he now changed his mind and gave her to the Trojan newcomer.<br><br>War was the inevitable outcome, and Aeneas killed Turnus in single combat. Following this victory he founded the city of Lavinium, named after his wife. The Rutulians were down but not out. Hostilities were resumed and a great battle was fought beside the river Numicius, near Lavinium. There were many casualties, and when night fell the armies separated.<br><br>Aeneas, though, had vanished. Some thought he had been translated to the gods, others that he had drowned. His mother, never knowingly worsted, arranged for him to be deified. Dionysius of Halicarnassus, an antiquarian who flourished in the first century a.d., reports that, in his day, a memorial was still standing on the site of the battle. It was a small mound around which stood regular rows of trees. An inscription read, &#x201c;To the father and god of this place, who presides over the waters of the river Numicius.&#x201d;<br><br>Seven years had passed since Aeneas left the smoldering ruins of Troy.</p><h2>Dragon Post</h2><p>One day, Alex finds a dragon living in the cupboard under the stairs.

With grace, compassion, and common sense, she tugs the lead of self-esteem encouraging the reader to follow her down a path toward greater self-wisdom. She explains that when we ignore "what matters most to us," that becomes "the matter with us." Then to make matters worse, because we're deaf to the voice of our embodied consciousness, we "cure" our symptoms and continue to dismiss our intuitive messages. Having greater control over our lives is ultimately what Reeves offers. "How vitally alive we would be if only we were able to develop as much confidence in what we feel and how that is moving us, as we do upon what we think and what that means to us," she exclaims.

He current serves as a professor of English at Louisiana State University, and lives in New Orleans with his wife and two daughters.A personal journey of Jewish spiritual renewal in dialogue with the Dalai Lama. Summoned by the Dalai Lama to Dharamsala, the retreat in northern India that the Tibetan exile community has inhabited since the Chinese invasion of Tibet in 1959, a group of eight Jewish leaders goes to India for a week of discussions in order to teach the Tibetan spiritual leader what the Jewish tradition has learned about religious self-preservation. Jewish poet and designated eyewitness Kamenetz (English/Louisiana Univ.) comes along for the ride and on the way learns about the richness of his own Jewish identity by hearing about its similarities to Tibetan Buddhism. Familiar with survival in the face of exile and near-annihilation, the Jewish leaders, mostly rabbis, communicate their wisdom to the Dalai Lama. While we are prepared for a two-way exchange, Kamenetz tells us mostly about the rich, contradictory life of modern Judaism: from the Orthodox Irving (``Yitz'') and Blu Greenberg, who are concerned with maintaining the purity of religious observance, to the kabbalistic Zalman Schachter-Shalomi, who, as a leader of the Reconstructionist movement, unites the esoteric traditions of Jewish mysticism with a post-1960s eclecticism. At the heart of the book is an exchange between Schachter-Shalomi and the Dalai Lama about the nature of angels and reincarnation, during which the Jews and Buddhists present realize the close parallels between their traditions. The large number of ``JUBUs,'' Jewish Buddhists (including Allen Ginsberg) Kamenetz encounters leads him to question the problem of some American Jews' conversion to Buddhism in response to what they perceived as Judaism's closed spiritual door. But as the reader discovers, the Jewish esoteric tradition, including specific spiritual practices such as meditation, is available to the ardent seeker.

But when it comes to indulging in these finer pleasures, the comic and former Saturday Night Live writer has a mantra: &#x201c;Make it a treat.&#x201d; This epiphany came to her in the midst of her freshman year at New York University, when a friend found her in the midst of an extended pot bender and imparted some guru-like wisdom: &#x201c;If you want to enjoy these things&#x2014;things like weed&#x2014;you have to make it a treat.&#x201d;1 On her show, The Sarah Silverman Program, she puts this mantra into action by insisting that her writers temper their innate overreliance on fart jokes.<br> <br>&#x201c;Fart jokes make me happier than just about anything in the universe,&#x201d; she explains. &#x201c;And for that reason I&#x2019;m terrified by the idea that someday I might have had enough of them.

And it can help people make wiser spending decisions. Abundance, it turns out, is the enemy of appreciation.<br> <br>Many of us are lucky enough to live in a society where chocolate is available in every supermarket, gas station, and movie theater. Ironically, though, this abundance may undermine our enjoyment of it. One afternoon, students came into a psychology lab to complete a simple task: eating a piece of chocolate.2 The following week they returned for a second piece. Overall, the students enjoyed the chocolate less the second time than they had the first. This is the sad reality of the human experience: in general, the more we&#x2019;re exposed to something, the more its impact diminishes.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s not all bad news. Getting used to things can be handy when it comes to cold winters or unpleasant smells. Early one Friday evening, Liz&#x2019;s Welsh corgi got sprayed by a skunk. In a moment of na�ve gallantry, she scooped the stinking dog into her arms, thereby covering herself in the scent, too. After hours of bathing both herself and the dog in tomatoes and other home remedies, Liz found that the scent had faded. She gave the dog a Snausage and headed off to a friend&#x2019;s party. Moments after Liz&#x2019;s arrival, the party hostess nervously sniffed the air and exclaimed, &#x201c;Skunk!&#x201d; The cure that Liz believed the home remedies had wrought was due to her own olfactory fatigue. After prolonged exposure to the bad smell, Liz became habituated to it, and its pungency faded. Many of us have experienced the process of getting used to bad things. We often fail to realize that a similar kind of habituation can kick in for positive experiences, like buying shiny new toys. From chocolate bars to luxury cars, habituation represents a fundamental barrier to deriving lasting pleasure from our purchases.<br> <br>Like houses, cars are among the largest purchases that most people make. Is it best to splurge on a BMW, economize with a Ford Escort, or settle for the mid-level option of a Honda Accord? When researchers at the University of Michigan asked students to predict how much pleasure they would experience while driving each type of car, the BMW was the clear winner.3 But do drivers experience more happiness behind the wheel of an expensive car? To find out, the Michigan researchers asked car owners to think back on the last time they had driven their car, rating how much they enjoyed that drive. Although their cars ranged widely in value, from around $400 (a Yugo, perhaps?) to $40,000, there was no relationship at all between the Blue Book value of the car and the amount of enjoyment the owners got from driving it that day.<br> <br>But here&#x2019;s the twist in the road: The researchers asked other drivers to list their car&#x2019;s make, model, and year, and then consider how they typically felt while driving it. When car owners thought about their vehicles in this light, those who owned more expensive cars reported deriving more enjoyment from driving. Suddenly there was a relationship between a car&#x2019;s value and its emotional payoff. Why? When people are asked how something generally makes them feel, they tend to draw on equally general theories to form an answer. Rather than reconstructing how they felt each of the last fifty times they drove the Bimmer and then averaging these experiences, a BMW owner is likely to think something like, &#x201c;I own a midnight blue Z4 with three hundred horsepower and a retractable hardtop. Of course I enjoy driving it. Next question.&#x201d; These undeniably fabulous features are likely to make a big difference for enjoyment during an initial test drive, which is why smart salespeople focus our attention on these features at the time of purchase. Novelty attracts the spotlight of attention, focusing our minds and exciting our emotions. But once we get used to something&#x2014;even something as nice as a midnight blue Z4&#x2014;the spotlight moves on. Driving to the grocery store in the dead of winter, we think about being stuck in the left lane behind an octogenarian in an Oldsmobile, about whether the store will have any hot rotisserie chickens left, about almost anything other than the make and model of the car we&#x2019;re driving. Retractable hardtops just aren&#x2019;t that relevant in subzero temperatures. And this explains why driving a more expensive car doesn&#x2019;t usually provide more joy than driving an economy model.<br> <br>Unless, that is, we make driving a treat. In a final study, the Michigan researchers asked car owners to think about the last time they had driven their car just for fun. When people thought back on their most recent joy ride, individuals with more expensive cars reported more pleasure from driving. But these joy rides were remarkably rare. So, driving a BMW probably won&#x2019;t provide you with any more pleasure than driving a Ford Escort&#x2014;except on those rare occasions when your attention turns to the car itself, whether directed by a question from a researcher or a joy ride on a winding mountain road.<br> The Deceptive Simplicity of Silverman&#x2019;s Mantra<p></p> <br>According to Oprah Winfrey, &#x201c;The single greatest thing you can do to change your life today would be to start being grateful for what you have.&#x201d;4 This is good advice. But, like a grapefruit diet, adopting an attitude of gratitude is easy at first but quickly becomes almost impossible. Because novelty captures our attention, we feel buoyantly grateful for things that catch us by surprise.5 The sixteen-year-old who lives out the teenage fantasy of discovering a new car wrapped in a giant red bow on his birthday will no doubt experience a surge of joy and gratitude. But these feelings are likely to fade as being a car owner becomes just another part of his daily experience and identity.<br> <br>Following Oprah&#x2019;s advice is hard for all of us, and ironically, it gets even harder as people edge closer and closer to Oprah&#x2019;s end of the wealth spectrum. In a study of working adults in Belgium, wealthier individuals reported a lower proclivity to savor life&#x2019;s little pleasures. They were less likely to say that they would pause to appreciate a beautiful waterfall on a hike, or stay present in the moment during a romantic weekend getaway.6 This phenomenon helps explain why the relationship between income and happiness is weaker than many people expect. At the same time that money increases our happiness by giving us access to all kinds of wonderful things, knowing we have access to wonderful things undermines our happiness by reducing our tendency to appreciate life&#x2019;s small joys.<br> <br>Just thinking about money can produce some of the same detrimental effects as having a lot of it. If you ever want those around you to act like wealthy people for a few minutes, research suggests that all you have to do is show them a photograph of a big stack of money.7 Seeing this photograph makes people less inclined to linger by a waterfall or savor life&#x2019;s other little pleasures, just like individuals who actually have a lot of money.8<br> <br>The idea that wealth interferes with the proclivity to savor echoes the theme of the classic 1964 children&#x2019;s book Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The young hero, Charlie Bucket, lives in a tiny two-room house with one bed and four grandparents. While the wealthier kids in the story gorge themselves on a plentiful supply of chocolate bars, Charlie&#x2019;s family saves up just enough money to give him one chocolate bar a year, on his birthday. Each time, he would &#x201c;treasure it as though it were a bar of solid gold,&#x201d; spending days just looking at it before he would finally &#x201c;peel back a tiny bit of the paper wrapping at one corner to expose a tiny bit of chocolate, and then he would take a tiny nibble, just enough to allow the lovely sweet taste to spread out slowly over his tongue. The next day, he would take another tiny nibble, and so on,&#x201d; making his annual bar of chocolate last over a month.9<br> <br>In a Willy Wonkaesque study, Canadian students saw a photograph of money and then ate a piece of chocolate, as researchers surreptitiously observed them.10 Compared to others who hadn&#x2019;t seen the money, students who saw this photograph spent substantially less time eating their chocolate, chowing it down like Augustus Gloop. The observers also noted less enjoyment on their faces. Because even a simple reminder of wealth undermines our ability to enjoy life&#x2019;s little treats, living by Silverman&#x2019;s Mantra may not be easy, at least for those of us who are wealthier than Charlie Bucket. According to Silverman: &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why mantras need to be repeated&#x2014;they&#x2019;re fucking hard to remember.&#x201d;11<br> <br>Most people recognize that they won&#x2019;t appreciate their car quite as much after owning it for twenty-four months as they did when they first drove it home, just as the twenty-fourth fart joke won&#x2019;t be as funny as the first one. When researchers at Yale asked people to predict how their enjoyment of various products might change over time, the majority expected their enjoyment would decline, for products ranging from a plasma TV to a kaleidoscope.12 The problem is that it&#x2019;s easy to lose sight of this knowledge when a shiny new toy is right at your fingertips. In another study, the Yale researchers gave students a kaleidoscope and asked half of them to predict how much they would enjoy playing with it a week later. Others predicted how much they would enjoy it a day later.13 Students expected to enjoy the kaleidoscope just as much regardless of the time frame they considered, even though most of their peers in the previous study believed that enjoyment of a kaleidoscope would decline with time. In other words, though we understand that enjoyment often fades over time, we don&#x2019;t always apply that knowledge when contemplating a new toy. When researchers prompt people to consider the passage of time, this reminder triggers the correct belief that the tide of enjoyment quickly recedes. In the absence of such reminders, however, people envision an unchanging sea of pleasure. As a result, products often provide less lasting enjoyment than people expect. Indeed, after students took their kaleidoscopes home, they reported enjoying the toys much less if they were contacted a week later rather than a day later.<br> <br>This drop in enjoyment occurs because people are fundamentally different from thermometers. Put a thermometer in lukewarm water, and the mercury rises to reflect the water&#x2019;s precise temperature. &#x201c;It does not matter whether the mercury was previously stored in an oven or an ice bath, or whether it was stored in either place for hours or days or years,&#x201d; researchers Shane Frederick and George Loewenstein explain. &#x201c;Mercury has no memory for previous states. Humans and other organisms do not behave this way.&#x201d;14 Stick your hand in lukewarm water and it may feel piping hot if you&#x2019;ve just come inside on a frigid winter morning, but cool and refreshing on a sweaty summer afternoon. Leave your hand in the water and the intensity of the initial sensation will soon subside. Our emotional system works in much the same way, making us highly sensitive to change. Understanding this fundamental difference between the thermometer and what we might call the &#x201c;cheerometer&#x201d; enables us to develop specific spending strategies designed to combat ennui.<br> The Wisdom of Candy Corn<p></p> <br>Because we lack mercury&#x2019;s amnesia, our enjoyment of a piece of chocolate typically declines from one week to the next. But there&#x2019;s a way to maximize the pleasure of that second confection. Temporarily giving up chocolate can restore our ability to enjoy it. After an initial chocolate tasting, students promised to abstain from chocolate for one week.15 Another group of students pledged to eat as much chocolate as they comfortably could, and they received a two-pound bag of chocolate to help them fulfill their pledge. The students who left with this reservoir of chocolatey goodness may seem like the lucky ones. But their sweet windfall came at a price. When they returned the following week to sample additional chocolate, they enjoyed it much less than they had the week before. People only enjoyed chocolate as much the second week as they had the first if they had given it up in between.I<br> <br>If abundance is the enemy of appreciation, scarcity may be our best ally.

But we are not advocating austerity, though the simple life does have its adherents. In the name of voluntary simplicity, people on the &#x201c;Great American Apparel Diet&#x201d; have given up buying clothes for a year.16 Other individuals have stripped their monthly wardrobes down to just six items.17 As coworkers in nearby cubicles might attest, it is possible to take this strategy too far.

He was a fine painter, a master wood carver, and one of the nation&#x2019;s foremost stained glass designers. He could sculpt, draw hunting portraits, and was considered a pioneer in the use of graphic art in modern advertising. His artistic genius came together in four artistic studios he built on Chicago&#x2019;s north side in the 1920s and 1930s. He touched almost every inch of the studios with daring and surprise. He took rustic brick, crude stone, salvaged tile, found glass, steel, and wood, then Edgarized&#x201d; the homes with stained glass windows, frescos, murals, tile work, and wood carving. This collection contains over 400 images of the homes, which remarkably remain intact today.</p></p><p><b>Richard Cahan</b> is&nbsp;a former picture editor for the <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i> and was the director of CITY 2000.

He decried waste and so used recycled materials and transformed old buildings into exuberantly decorated architectural marvels. Phenomenally gifted and prolific, Miller was renowned, even legendary, and then he was forgotten, except by those who dwell in his wildly original homes. Cahan and Williams, the team who resurrected the life and work of architectural photographer Richard Nickel, vividly recount Miller&#x2019;s story of genius and audacity, from his Idaho youth to his meteoric rise in Chicago. Architectural photographer AlexanderVertikoff&#x2019;s sharp and lustrous images elegantly capture the extraordinary details, rich colors, and profound connectivity of Miller&#x2019;s spectacular creations. Miller&#x2019;s fecund imagination, virtuosity, and epic energy produced vibrant architecture in which every element from ceiling to floor is alive with arabesque imagery, entwined patterns, and an aura of aspiration.

Sixty years later, after further violent rebellions and the city&#x2019;s final destruction, Hadrian built the new city of Aelia Capitolina where Jerusalem had once stood.

He delineates the incompatibility between the cultural, political, and religious beliefs and practices of the two peoples. He explains how Rome&#x2019;s interests were served by a policy of brutality against the Jews. He makes clear how the original Christians first distanced themselves from their origins, and then became increasingly hostile toward Jews as Christian influence spread within the empire.

Rome, the &#x201c;Eternal City,&#x201d; has long been conceived as the epitome of magnificent power imposed through military might and the force of law and as a warning of the dangers of moral corruption. The picturesque ruins of the imperial city have both fascinated and repelled, stimulating admiration for brilliant achievements by past generations and rumination on the fallibility of human desire for glory. Such images retain a hold even now in literature, art and cinema. In contrast, Jerusalem has been idealized as a holy place of revelations, miracles and spiritual intensity. The origins of these idealized images lie in the real history of these cities in the time of Jesus. At the beginning of the first millennium ce both cities were at the peak of their prosperity and grandeur, each famous throughout the Mediterranean world and beyond. They were two cities whose inhabitants came into close contact: Romans visited Jerusalem as soldiers, politicians, tourists; Jews came to Rome as suppliants, slaves or fortune-seekers. They were two cities with a culture partly shared, from the gleam of ceremonial white masonry in the summer sun to acceptance of Greek as a prestige language of the erudite and the influence of Greek architecture and philosophy. They were two cities that shared a political world fostered by friendships, alliances, patronage. But they were two cities which, as it turned out, came into conflict, with terrible results. <br><br>That a great deal can be said about both cities two thousand years ago is not entirely a matter of chance. Both Romans and Jews prized highly the art of writing, and produced large literatures. No less important, in both cases much of the literature survives to the present through a tradition of manuscript copying and preservation which was continuous from late antiquity to the Renaissance and the invention of printing. In the case of the Jews, Hebrew and Aramaic writings were preserved within the literary tradition of the rabbis, whose teachings, formulated in the first five centuries ce, laid the foundations of both medieval and modern orthodox Judaism. Jewish writings in Greek were ignored by the rabbis but preserved by Christians, who appropriated to themselves for religious edification a large number of Jewish texts composed before c.100 CE, including the&nbsp; Septuagint (the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, with additional material now commonly found in English Bibles as the Apocrypha), the philosophical treatises of Philo, the histories of Josephus, and Greek versions of more mystical Jewish writings originally composed in Hebrew or Aramaic. <br><br>Christians were also responsible for the preservation of much of the literature of ancient Rome. From the fourth century CE Christians adopted the literature of pagan Greece and Rome as their own. Some pagans, like the emperor Julian (ruled 361&#x2013;3), objected that Christians could not properly teach literature about the pagan gods if they did not believe in them, and the Christian St. Jerome (c. 347&#x2013;420) worried that his devotion to Ciceronian style in his Latin prose made him less devoted to his faith, but during the fifth century the great works of Greek and Latin literature came to be seen by many Christians simply as a central element in the education of Christian Romans alongside the texts composed by Christians themselves. Thus many texts survive through the pious efforts of monks, from Cassiodorus in sixth-century Italy to the industrious scholars of Byzantium as late as the fifteenth century, who saw the reproduction of manuscripts as an act of devotion, almost regardless of their contents; and from many of the pagan writings they preserved, such as Vergil&#x2019;s <i>Aeneid</i> or the philosophical musings of Seneca, Christians would in time derive appropriate moral teachings. <br><br>The inhabitants of Jerusalem and Rome inevitably shared many experiences imposed upon them by the natural rhythms of the Mediterranean climate. For Jews, the Mediterranean was <i>haYam haGadol,</i> &#x201c;the Great Sea&#x201d;; <i>yama</i>, the word for &#x201c;west&#x201d; in Hebrew, reflected the view of the sea from Judaea. For the Romans, the Mediterranean was simply <i>mare nostrum</i>, &#x201c;our sea,&#x201d; rather like the English view of La Manche as the English Channel. Both cities sometimes experienced stifling heatwaves at the height of summer, although in Jerusalem, where snow is a great rarity, winters were milder than in Rome, where freezing temperatures are not unknown. Annual rainfall was less in Jerusalem than in Rome, and the summer drought, which could last from May to late November, was much longer and more complete, so that farmers in the Judaean hills relied more on the heavy dew precipitated by the sharp drop of air temperature at night. But in both cities people were all too aware of the potential effect of drought. In Jerusalem in 24 and 23 BCE drought led to food shortages and thus to plague, and to a dangerous lack of clothing in winter because flocks had died and there was &#x201c;no wool or any other material to cover themselves.&#x201d; Livy, in the time of Augustus, thought it worth including in his history of Rome the information that the year 181 BCE, nearly two centuries before, had been &#x201c;remarkable for drought and the failure of the crops. The story goes that for six months it did not rain at all.&#x201d;[1] Inhabitants of both cities imagined agricultural plenty in terms of wine, fruits and olives, grown on terraced hillsides, and pasturage, to supplement the grain crops cultivated on coastal plains and in valleys where the ground was sufficiently level for shallow ploughing. A Roman would have well understood the divine blessing that, if Israel will obey God&#x2019;s commandments, &#x201c;I will give the rain for your land in its due season, the first rain and the latter rain, so that you may gather in your grain, and your wine, and your oil. And I shall send grass in your fields for your cattle,&#x201d; and the prophet Micah looking forward to the days when &#x201c;they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree, and none shall make them afraid.&#x201d;[2] <br><br>But away from the sea, the ecology of Judaea was very different from anything to be found in Italy and in some ways Jerusalem lay outside the Mediterranean sphere. The distinctive geography of the land of Israel is a result of the great rift valley which runs southwards from Syria towards Africa and includes the long stretch of the Jordan valley, ending in the region of the Dead Sea, many feet below sea level. Moving eastwards from Jerusalem, the terraced hillsides rapidly gave way in antiquity to semi-desert. As the road descended towards Jericho, the wholly arid terrain was punctuated only by rare oases such as Jericho itself, En Gedi, and the spring of En Feshqa, which fed the strange community of Jews who inhabited Qumran, the site near which the Dead Sea scrolls were found. Josephus with some reason extolled the extraordinary fertility of such parts of the rift valley as could be sufficiently watered: on the borders of the Sea of Galilee, he claimed, fruit trees bore their produce continuously throughout the year.[3] <br><br>Josephus had good reason to exaggerate the prosperity of the land of Israel, both through natural patriotism and out of a desire to demonstrate the impressive feats of his patrons, the emperors Vespasian and Titus, but his geographical information can probably be trusted, and it is striking that he divided the Jewish homeland not into two, Judaea and Galilee, but into three: Judaea, Galilee and Peraea (which is Transjordan). Jewish territory looked not just west, towards the sea, and north, towards Galilee, but also east, towards the desert. The region east of the Jordan rises up to a basalt plateau made sufficiently fertile by precipitation of rain coming from the west to support a small number of cities in the Roman period&#x2014;Philadelphia (on the site of modern Amman), Jerash and Pella among others&#x2014;fed by grain production and the raising of livestock, particularly cattle. Further east still lay the semi-desert, suitable only for the grazing of sheep and goats (what the Bible called &#x201c;small cattle&#x201d;), and beyond the Peraea the Syrian desert itself, which was opening up precisely in the first century bce into a major highway for international trade from Mesopotamia. The success of the camel caravans was best illustrated by the growing prosperity of the oasis of Palmyra, the trading centre known in the biblical texts as Tadmor. It was in the Roman period, particularly in the two and a half centuries after the imposition of Roman authority in c. 17 ce, that the oasis reached the apogee of its wealth; many of the splendid tombs and temples on which the Palmyrenes lavished their wealth, favouring a curious amalgam of Parthian, Greek, semitic and Roman artistic traits, can still be seen.[4] <br><br>Links to the east mattered to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. Josephus even claims, in answer to the calumny that Jews could not have had a distinguished ancient history since the ancient Greeks did not write about them, that &#x201c;ours is not a country with a sea coast; neither commerce nor the mixing which it enables with others has any attraction for us. Our cities are built inland, remote from the sea . . .&#x201d; Certainly Judaean Jews maintained close contact in the first century with their fellow Jews in Babylonia, undeterred by the fact that Babylon was ruled by Parthia, outside the sphere of Roman control. Herod the Great established in Batanaea, to the east of the Sea of Galilee, a military colony of Babylonian Jews to provide protection against brigandage for pilgrims coming to the Jerusalem Temple from Mesopotamia. According to Josephus, the first High Priest appointed by Herod after his capture of Jerusalem in 37 BCE was a certain Ananel, a Babylonian of inferior priestly origin. According to later rabbinic tradition, the great scholar Hillel, who flourished in Jerusalem in the early first century CE, also came originally from Babylon.[5] <br><br>On the other hand, if Judaea was not a wholly Mediterranean culture, neither did it easily fall into a category defined by the fertile crescent which links this region to Mesopotamia. The region shared the use of a language, Aramaic, which had originated in upper Mesopotamia and then spread to the Levant primarily through its adoption as the language of royal administration in the Persian empire during the fifth and fourth centuries BCE; but there is no evidence that inhabitants of the fertile crescent had a sense of common destiny such as was found among some communities on the shores of the Mediterranean, particularly the Greeks. Such a sense of belonging even to a smaller regional entity is not widely attested for communities in the Near East apart from the Jews until the imposition of Roman rule, and the regional identities which then emerged seem often to have been by adoption of Roman or Greek categories. During the first three centuries CE the Near East became increasingly Roman, both in the sense of a concentration of state military resources in the eastern part of the Roman empire and through the award to existing cities of the status of Roman colony, but in the early first century CE this process was still in its infancy. Viewed from the rest of the Mediterranean world, much of the fertile crescent, variously designated as Syria, Assyria or Arabia or by other exotic names, was still an undifferentiated region of little-known barbarism. To some extent, the unhappy fortune of Jerusalem under Roman rule was a result of the city&#x2019;s ambivalent position between the Mediterranean world and the Near East.[6]<br>Despite all the differences between the cultures of the two cities, a casual visitor to Rome and Jerusalem in the last decades of the first century BCE might have been more struck by similarities, since it was during these years that both cities metamorphosed from ramshackle agglomerations into shining testimonies to massive state expenditure. Rome, which up to the mid-first century BCE had been an unimpressive collection of brick buildings divided by winding alleyways, clustered around a small public area in the Forum and on the Capitoline hill, was remodelled with a series of new monumental public buildings and grand public spaces. Similarly, Jerusalem was expanded and transformed by Herod, to make it, as a Roman observer, the elder Pliny, proclaimed after its destruction in 70 CE, &#x201c;by far the most famous city of the East.&#x201d; Both cities used the most up-to-date techniques of urban planning, borrowed architectural styles from the most impressive city of the previous generation, Alexandria in Egypt, and used vaulted arches to erect platforms out from the side of hills to form level public spaces. These two ancient cities were reborn at the same time and in similar ways, but the origin of the glory of Rome was wholly different from the foundation of the splendour of Jerusalem.[7]<br><b>Rome </b><br><br>When Josephus came to Rome from Jerusalem for his brief visit in the early 60s CE he found the city at the height of its opulence. The huge, sprawling city lay on the river Tiber, near the west coast of Italy and above the plain of Latium. By the first century, the true origins of the city had long been lost from collective memory, and speculation about its mythical foundation allowed free range to the imagination of poets and historians. Already by the early part of the first millennium bce isolated villages, similar to others in the surrounding region of Latium, were in existence on the hills of the site that was to become Rome. These settlements grew in size and sophistication over the ensuing centuries, but the origins of the city as a single political unit are best dated to c.600 BCE, when the Forum was laid out as a public meeting space in the valley between the hilltops. From then to the mid-first century BCE, the power of the city grew inexorably. Incorporation of all of Latium was followed by a gradual expansion of influence over the rest of Italy. In the third century bce a long, bitter, but eventually successful struggle against the Phoenician trading city of Carthage, which lay on the north coast of Africa in modern Tunisia but also had many interests in Sicily and in Spain, left Rome in control of much of the coast of the western Mediterranean and, through use of a newly confident navy, of the sea routes between them. The conflict also left a residue of vocabulary and concepts to express hostility and contempt for a dangerous enemy, defined by their Punic language and customs as irremediably fickle. This early encounter was to have a formative effect on later Roman attitudes to barbarians from the Syrian East.<br><b>NOTES</b><br>[1] Joseph. <i>AJ</i> 15. 310; Livy 40.29.<br>[2] Deut.

Many ideas have been presented regarding the cause of these problems, but only George Gilder speaks directly and with authority about their one undeniable source: the disintegration of the American family.<br>Men and Marriage examines the loss of the family and the well-defined sex roles it used to offer and how this loss has changed the focus of our society. Poverty, for instance, comes from the destruction of the family when single parents are abandoned by their lovers or older women are suddenly divorced because society approves of the husband's new, younger girlfriend. Gilder claims that men will only own up to their paternal obligations when the women lead them to do so and that this civilizing influence, balanced with, proper economic support, is the most important part of maintaining a productive, healthy, loving society. He offers a concrete plan of action for rebuilding the family in America. His solutions challenge readers to return to these roles and reestablish those family values which were once so crucial in staving off the ills that plague our country.</p>George Gilder is author of several books on social and economic issues.

The story of a lifetime of such minute explorations, <i>For Love of Insects</i> celebrates the small creatures that have emerged triumphant on the planet, the beneficiaries of extraordinary evolutionary inventiveness and unparalleled reproductive capacity. </p><p> To understand the success of insects is to appreciate our own shortcomings, Eisner tells us, but never has a reckoning been such a pleasure. Recounting exploits and discoveries in his lab at Cornell and in the field in Uruguay, Australia, Panama, Europe, and North America, Eisner time and again demonstrates how inquiry into the survival strategies of an insect leads to clarifications beyond the expected; insects are revealed as masters of achievement, forms of life worthy of study and respect from even the most recalcitrant entomophobe. Filled with descriptions of his ingenious experiments and illustrated with photographs unmatched for their combination of scientific content and delicate beauty, Eisner's book makes readers participants in the grand adventure of discovery on a scale infinitesimally small, and infinitely surprising. </p></p><p><b>Thomas Eisner</b> is J.

(<em>Los Angeles Times Book Review</em>).</strong><br><br> <i>Both Flesh and Not</i> gathers fifteen of Wallace's seminal essays, all published in book form for the first time.<br><br>Never has Wallace's seemingly endless curiosity been more evident than in this compilation of work spanning nearly 20 years of writing. Here, Wallace turns his critical eye with equal enthusiasm toward Roger Federer and Jorge Luis Borges; <i>Terminator 2</i> and <i>The Best of the Prose Poem</i>; the nature of being a fiction writer and the quandary of defining the essay; the best underappreciated novels and the English language's most irksome misused words; and much more.<br><br><i>Both Flesh and Not</i> restores Wallace's essays as originally written, and it includes a selection from his personal vocabulary list, an assembly of unusual words and definitions.</p><p>David Foster Wallace was born in Ithaca, New York, in 1962 and raised in Illinois, where he was a regionally ranked junior tennis player. He received bachelor of arts degrees in philosophy and English from Amherst College and wrote what would become his first novel, <em>The Broom of the System</em>, as his senior English thesis. He received a masters of fine arts from University of Arizona in 1987 and briefly pursued graduate work in philosophy at Harvard University. His second novel,<em> Infinite Jest</em>, was published in 1996. Wallace taught creative writing at Emerson College, Illinois State University, and Pomona College, and published the story collections <em>Girl with Curious Hair</em>, <em>Brief Interviews with Hideous Men</em>, <em>Oblivion, </em>the essay collections <em>A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again,</em> and <em>Consider the Lobster</em>. He was awarded the MacArthur Fellowship, a Lannan Literary Award, and a Whiting Writers' Award, and was appointed to the Usage Panel for The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language. He died in 2008. His last novel, <em>The Pale King</em>, was published in 2011."Scarily astute. . . . Published originally between 1988 and 2007, these essays demonstrate Wallace's interdisciplinary approach to both pop culture and abstruse academic discourse...For Wallace devotees, these essays are required reading."--<em>Booklist</em><br><br>"A collection spanning 20 years of Wallace's nonfiction writing on subjects as wide-ranging as math, Borges, democracy, the U.S. Open, and the entire spectrum of human experience in between...<i>Both Flesh and Not</i> is excellent in its entirety and just as quietly, unflinchingly soul-stirring."--Maria Popova, <em>Atlantic</em><br><br>"At their best these essays remind us of Wallace's arsenal of talents: his restless, heat-seeking reportorial eye; his ability to convey the physical or emotional truth of things with a couple of flicks of the wrist; his capacity to make leaps, from the mundane to the metaphysical, with breathtaking velocity and ardor."--Michiko Kakutani, <em>New York Times</em><br><br>"David Foster Wallace left the essay form in a different state than it was in before he wrote. He wrote of Federer that he had 'exposed the limits, and possibilities, of' his sport. Wallace himself, with mystery and metaphysics galore, did no less for the essay."--Michael Robbins, Chicago Tribune Printers Row<br><br>"If you like essays, vocabulary lists (blepharitis! gastine!), footnotes (so many footnotes), and/or DFW, you need this."--Largehearted Boy<br><br>"One of the best writers of our time....If you've never read David Foster Wallace before, his masterful study of Roger Federer, included in this anthology, is an ideal place to start."--Steph Opitz, <em>Marie Claire</em><br><br>"Like previous collections of David Foster Wallace's essays, <i>Both Flesh and</i> Not displays the late author's vast intellectual curiosity....showcase[s] Wallace's ever-evolving, intimate, and often humorous relationship with language."--The New Yorker Page-Turner<br><br>"David Foster Wallace's essays show a man struggling to figure out the complexities of discernment and judgment....It isn't merely wonderful writing. It is a model of adult citizenship....In <i>Both Flesh and Not</i>, he is at the top of his game."--David Masciotra, The Daily Beast<br><br>"The best passages are those that celebrate words and the author's relationship with them....It is a treasure trove for those who love the complexities of language."--Josh Davis, <em>Time Out</em><br><br>"I doubt there's a single person reading this paper who needs me to explain why they should be excited about a new collection of previously uncollected David Foster Wallace essays. His nonfiction is born out of the sort of bitingly perceptive but deeply compassionate humanity our world needs more of, and we should savor every last bit of it he left us."--Rian Johnson, writer and director of "Brick" and "Looper"</p><h2>Kartusch: A Serendipity Book</h2><p>The Furry Eyefulls who inhabit the forest become cranky and grouchy because they are so afraid of not seeing something beautiful around them that they never close their eyes or go to sleep</p><p><b>Stephen Cosgrove</b> is one of the best-selling children&#x2019;s book authors of all time.

Kabbalah teaches that the alphabet, called ivrit in Hebrew, comes from the root word lavir, or to transfer. Far more than simple symbols of communication, the letters transfer energy from the Light of God into the physical world. The story of the letters as they pleaded their respective cases for the primary role in God s creative process is the blueprint by which Creation was made possible. In his new book, Rav Berg reveals the spiritual meaning and history of each of the 22 letters: how and why each was created, and what energy it transmits. Berg uses quantum physics to illustrate this bedrock of Kabbalah, proving that this truly is a time when physicists and metaphysicists are joining hands and minds.</p><p>Rav Berg was born August 20, 1927, in New York City. After many years of traditional religious study, he was ordained as a rabbi at Torah VaDaat. A businessman who wanted to make a difference in this world, he was always searching for his true path. Upon a chance meeting with Rav Yehuda Brandwein, Rav Berg knew he had found his teacher, and moved to Israel to study with Rav Brandwein at The Kabbalah Centre. After he returned to New York, Rav Berg maintained a written correspondence with Rav Brandwein who passed on his legacy as director of The Kabbalah Centre to Rav Berg Rav Berg made it his mission to continue editing, writing, printing, and distributing all that he learned from his teacher and began sharing the secrets of Kabbalah texts, which historically had been reserved for scholars. His book, Kabbalah for the Layman, was the revolutionary step that made Kabbalah accessible to every person. Rav Berg s other books include The Kabbalah Connection, Wheels of a Soul: Kabbalah and Reincarnation, To the Power of One, Energy of the Hebrew Letters, Immortality, Nano, The Kabbalah Method, Taming Chaos, and Education of a Kabbalist. Together with his wife, Karen, Rav Berg opened the doors of The Kabbalah Centre to all who desire to learn this universal wisdom. Following Rav Berg&#39;s passing in September 2013, Karen Berg, the spiritual leader of The Kabbalah Centre, continues their work and vision with their son and co-director, Michael Berg.</p><h2>Doctor Dogbody&#39;s Leg (Heart of Oak Sea Classics Series)</h2><p>Ripping sea yarns from the creator of Mutiny on the Bounty.<br><br>James Norman Hall is best known as the co-author of the classic Bounty trilogy.

But there was something so grotesque about this particular corpse, and so threatening to civic peace, that the magistrate responsible for keeping order in the city, Gaius Octavius, sent word to Cicero asking him to come at once. </p><p>Cicero at first was reluctant to go, pleading pressure of work. As the consular candidate who had topped the poll, it fell to him, rather than his colleague, to preside over the opening session of the Senate, and he was writing his inaugural address. But I knew there was more to it than that. He had an unusual squeamishness about death. Even the killing of animals in the games disturbed him, and this weakness&#x2014;for, alas, in politics a soft heart is always perceived as a weakness&#x2014;had started to be noticed. His immediate instinct was to send me in his place. </p><p>&#x201c;Of course I shall go,&#x201d; I replied carefully. &#x201c;But&#x2014;&#x201d; I let my sentence trail away. </p><p>&#x201c;But?&#x201d; he said sharply. &#x201c;But what? You think it will look bad?&#x201d; </p><p>I held my tongue and continued transcribing his speech. The silence lengthened. </p><p>&#x201c;Oh, very well,&#x201d; he groaned at last. He heaved himself to his feet. &#x201c;Octavius is a dull dog, but steady enough. He wouldn&#x2019;t summon me unless it was important. In any case I need to clear my head.&#x201d; </p><p>It was late December, and from a dark gray sky blew a wind that was quick enough and sharp enough to steal your breath. Outside in the street a dozen petitioners were huddled, hoping for a word, and as soon as they saw the consul-elect stepping through his front door they ran across the road toward him. &#x201c;Not now,&#x201d; I said, pushing them back. &#x201c;Not today.&#x201d; Cicero threw the edge of his cloak over his shoulder and tucked his chin down onto his chest, and we set off briskly down the hill. </p><p>We must have walked about a mile, I suppose, crossing the Forum at an angle and leaving the city by the river gate. The waters of the Tiber were fast and high, flexed by yellowish-brown whirlpools and writhing currents. Up ahead, opposite Tiber Island, amid the wharfs and cranes of the Navalia, we could see a large crowd milling around. (You will get a sense of how long ago all this happened, by the way&#x2014;more than half a century&#x2014;when I tell you that the island was not yet linked by its bridges to either bank.) As we drew closer many of the onlookers recognized Cicero and there was a stir of curiosity as they parted to let us through. A cordon of legionnaires from the marine barracks was protecting the scene. Octavius was waiting. </p><p>&#x201c;My apologies for disturbing you,&#x201d; said Octavius, shaking my master&#x2019;s hand. &#x201c;I know how busy you must be, so close to your inauguration.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;My dear Octavius, it is a pleasure to see you at any time. You know my secretary, Tiro?&#x201d; </p><p>Octavius glanced at me without interest. Although he is remembered today only as the father of Augustus, he was at this time aedile of the plebs and very much the coming man. He would probably have made consul himself had he not died prematurely of a fever some four years after this encounter. He led us out of the wind and into one of the great military boathouses, where the skeleton of a liburnian, stripped for repair, sat on huge wooden rollers. Next to it on the earth floor an object lay shrouded in sailcloth. Without pausing for ceremony, Octavius threw aside the material to show us the naked body of a boy. </p><p>He was about twelve, as I remember. His face was beautiful and serene, quite feminine in its delicacy, with traces of gold paint glinting on the nose and cheeks, and with a bit of red ribbon tied in his damp brown curls. His throat had been cut. His body had been slashed open all the way down to the groin and emptied of its organs. There was no blood, only that dark, elongated cavity, like a gutted fish, filled with river mud. How Cicero managed to contemplate the sight and maintain his composure I do not know, but he swallowed hard and kept on looking. Eventually he said hoarsely, &#x201c;This is an outrage.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;And that&#x2019;s not all,&#x201d; said Octavius. He squatted on his haunches, took hold of the lad&#x2019;s skull between his hands, and turned it to the left. As the head moved, the gaping wound in the neck opened and closed obscenely, as if it were a second mouth trying to whisper a warning to us. Octavius seemed entirely indifferent to this, but then of course he was a military man and no doubt used to such sights. He pulled back the hair to reveal a deep indentation just above the boy&#x2019;s right ear, and pressed his thumb into it. &#x201c;Do you see? It looks as if he was felled from behind. I&#x2019;d say by a hammer.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;His face painted. His hair beribboned. Felled from behind by a hammer,&#x201d; repeated Cicero, his words slowing as he realized where his logic was leading him. &#x201c;And then his throat cut. And finally his body . . . eviscerated.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Exactly,&#x201d; said Octavius. &#x201c;His killers must have wanted to inspect his entrails. He was a sacrifice&#x2014;a human sacrifice.&#x201d; </p><p>At those words, in that cold dim place, the hairs on the nape of my neck stirred and spiked, and I knew myself to be in the presence of Evil&#x2014;Evil as a palpable force, as potent as lightning. </p><p>Cicero said, &#x201c;Are there any cults in the city you have heard of that might practice such an abomination?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;None. There are always the Gauls, of course&#x2014;they are said to do such things. But there aren&#x2019;t many of them in town at the moment, and those that are here are well behaved.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;And who is the victim? Has anyone claimed him?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s another reason I wanted you to come and see for yourself.&#x201d; Octavius rolled the body over onto its stomach. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a small owner&#x2019;s tattoo just above his backside, do you see? Those who dumped the body may have missed it. &#x2018;C.Ant.M.f.C.n.&#x2019; &#x2018;Caius Antonius, son of Marcus, grandson of Caius.&#x2019; There&#x2019;s a famous family for you! He was a slave of your consular colleague, Antonius Hybrida.&#x201d; He stood and wiped his hands on the sailcloth, then casually threw the cover back over the body. &#x201c;What do you want to do?&#x201d; </p><p>Cicero was staring at the pathetic bundle on the floor as if mesmerized. &#x201c;Who knows about this?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Nobody.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Hybrida?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;What about the crowd outside?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a rumor going around there&#x2019;s been some kind of ritual killing. You above all know what crowds are like. They&#x2019;re saying it&#x2019;s a bad omen on the eve of your consulship.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;They may be right.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s been a hard winter. They could do with calming down. I thought we might send word to the College of Priests and ask them to perform some kind of ceremony of purification&#x2014;&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;No, no,&#x201d; said Cicero quickly, pulling his gaze away from the body. &#x201c;No priests. Priests will only make it worse.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;So what shall we do?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Tell no one else. Burn the remains as quickly as possible. Don&#x2019;t let anyone see them. Forbid anyone who has seen them from disclosing the details, on pain of imprisonment, or worse.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;And the crowd?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;You deal with the body. I&#x2019;ll deal with the crowd.&#x201d; </p><p>Octavius shrugged. &#x201c;As you wish.&#x201d; He sounded unconcerned. He had only one day left in office&#x2014;I should imagine he was glad to be rid of the problem. </p><p>Cicero went over to the door and inhaled a few deep breaths, bringing some color back to his cheeks. Then I saw him, as I had so often, square his shoulders and clamp a confident expression on his face. He stepped outside and clambered up onto a stack of timber to address the crowd. </p><p>&#x201c;People of Rome, I have satisfied myself that the dark rumors running through the city are false!&#x201d; He had to bellow into that biting wind to make himself heard. &#x201c;Go home to your families and enjoy the rest of the festival!&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;But I saw the body!&#x201d; shouted a man. &#x201c;It was a human sacrifice, to call down a curse on the republic!&#x201d; </p><p>The cry was taken up by others: &#x201c;The city is cursed!&#x201d; &#x201c;Your consulship is cursed!&#x201d; &#x201c;Fetch the priests!&#x201d; </p><p>Cicero raised his hands. &#x201c;Yes, the corpse was in a dreadful state. But what do you expect? The poor lad had been in the water a long time. The fish are hungry. They take their food where they can. You really want me to bring a priest? To do what? To curse the fish? To <i>bless</i> the fish?&#x201d; A few people began to laugh. &#x201c;Since when did Romans become frightened of <i>fish</i> ? Go home. Enjoy yourselves. The day after tomorrow there will be a new year, with a new consul&#x2014;one who you can be sure will always guard your welfare!&#x201d; </p><p>It was no great oration by his standards but it did what was required. There were even a few cheers. He jumped down. The legionnaires cleared a path for us through the mob and we retreated quickly toward the city. As we neared the gate I glanced back. At the fringes of the crowd people were already beginning to wander away in search of fresh diversions. I turned to Cicero to congratulate him on the effectiveness of his remarks, but he was leaning over the roadside ditch, vomiting. </p><p>Such was the state of the city on the eve of Cicero&#x2019;s consulship&#x2014;a vortex of hunger, rumor, and anxiety; of crippled veterans and bankrupt farmers begging at every corner; of roistering bands of drunken young men terrorizing shopkeepers; of women from good families openly prostituting themselves outside the taverns; of sudden conflagr...</p></p><h2>Living Juicy: Daily Morsels for Your Creative Soul</h2><p>LIVING JUICY is jumping for joy on the inside.

Loretta Young&#39;s faith and determination come to life in this carefully researched biography of her life. For 30 years, Miss Young had refused overtures from biographers. In 1998, she met New York Times bestselling author Joan Wester Anderson and commented to her daughter-in-law Linda Lewis, &#34;That&#39;s the woman I want to write the story of my life.&#34; When Linda queried Miss Young about the choice, her comment was, &#34;Who better than a writer of angels and miracles to tell the story of my life?&#34;In the only authorized biography of the life of Hollywood legend Loretta Young, New York Times bestselling author Joan Wester Anderson paints an honest portrait of a woman dedicated to her family, to her screen career, but above all, to her God. In Forever Young, Anderson reveals the actress&#39;s passion for unforgettable performances onscreeen, but whose proudest accomplishment later in life was helping others in need. Forever Young is the inspirational story of Loretta Young, who made an impressive 100 films in just twenty-five years. She co-starred with Grant Withers, Clark Gable, Spencer Tracy, Cary Grant, Gary Cooper, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., William Holden, Tyrone Power and James Cagney. She won an Oscar in 1948 for her portrayal of a Swedish maid in The Farmer&#39;s Daughter, beating out Rosalind Russell. Five years later, Miss Young moved to television becoming the queen of Eisenhower-era matrons in &#34;The Loretta Young Show,&#34; which ran an impressive eight years. In 1! 994, Loretta Young&#39;s &#34;adopted&#34; daughter Judy Lewis announced that Miss Young and Clark Gable were her biological parents---a claim that Young, who had co-starred with Gable in Call of the Wild (1935) has now answered definitively in Forever Young: The Life, Loves and Enduring Faith of a Hollywood legend.

A pilot, West Point graduate, and veteran of Desert Storm and the Special Forces, Castillo has a sharp eye for the facts-and the reality behind the facts. Traveling undercover, he flies to Africa, and there, helped and hindered by unexpected allies and determined enemies, begins to untangle a story of frightening dimensions-a story that, unless he can do something about it, will end very, very badly.</p><p>W.E.B.

In frustration, the president turns to an outside investigator to determine the truth, and Charlie Castillo, the latest W.E.B. Griffin leading man, takes center stage. Dick Hill does a top-notch job presenting a huge cast of charters from far-flung corners of the globe. His narration truly captures the ebb and flow of emotion as Castillo and his colleagues race to save the Liberty Bell. The Liberty Bell?

For more information on Terrence Real, please visit www.terrencereal.com<b>Introduction</b> <p> The relationship between men and women is in trouble, and it has been for over a generation. The relatively stable divorce rate over the past few decades indicates that the advent of couple's therapy in the 1950s has so far yielded nothing potent enough to affect the fate of the roughly one out of two couples who will see their marriage dissolve. We have enjoyed a period of unheralded creativity and prosperity. We marvel at new advances in technology and science that lengthen and strengthen our lives every day. No generation in history has taken so seriously issues of health and well-being -- both for ourselves and our children. And yet, nonetheless, we have never been lonelier. Our sense of community is breaking down, our sense of belonging has seldom felt weaker, and, silhouetted against this backdrop, couples that once loved one another have never had a more difficult time holding fast. </p><p> For over forty years the enormously influential women's movement has examined the oppression of girls and women in our society, the corrosive force leveled against our daughters to make them conform -- and the psychological cost of girls' compliance. We have just begun to extend similar empathy and support to our sons. And even now, as I write, it seems easier for us as a culture to empathize with boys than with grown men. But if we are to heal the enmity between the sexes -- collectively as a culture or individually in our own marriages -- we must begin to understand the forces that shape, and misshape, our husbands. The idea of opening our hearts to men will strike some women as opening the door to disempowerment. Being "soft" on men means to many a facile excuse for difficult, even dangerous behavior. There has been a split in our cultural attitude toward men. For a generation, feminists have held men responsible for privileged, insensitive, and at times offensive behaviors. But most feminists have not spoken to men's subjective experience of pain. Psychologists and those in the men's movement, by contrast, have begun to look at the cultural gauntlet through which our sons must pass, and the damage it does to them. But, in all their empathy, they rarely acknowledge the power men wield. One camp speaks of the violence men do, the other of the violence done to them. If men and women are to learn how to preserve the natural state of love and respect each deserves, both aspects of masculinity must be addressed -- the wounding and the wound. </p><p> Since the publication of my previous book, <i>I Don't Want to Talk About It: Overcoming the Secret Legacy of Male Depression,</i> I have spent a fair amount of time on the road, speaking and giving workshops throughout the country to both health professionals and to the general public about men and what ails them. Wherever I have gone, I have been struck by a burgeoning desire, almost a sense of urgency, about "figuring men out" -- how we can help struggling sons, husbands, fathers, in much the same way that women collectively began helping daughters, wives, and mothers a generation ago. </p><p> The latest research on boys and their development tells us that, despite our raised consciousness and good intentions, boys today, no less than ever before, are permeated with an inescapable set of highly constricting rules. Those boys who try to "step out of the box" place themselves in harm's way since, even today, our culture's tolerance for young men who deviate from what we deem masculine is limited, and our intolerance expresses itself in singularly ugly ways. The great bind is that those boys who do not resist, who choose or who are coerced to comply, do not escape either. Avoiding attack from without, those who adopt the traditions of male stoicism and "self-reliance" risk injury to the deepest and most alive aspects of their own being. The consequence of opposition is psychological and often physical brutality. The consequence of compliance is emotional truncation, numbness, and isolation. </p><p> "Good-bye, Justin," I say as I drop my thirteen-year-old off at school in the morning. Unlike his ten-year-old brother, Alexander, Justin averts his face from my farewell kiss, concerned that we will be observed. Though Justin is ebullient and vivacious at home, his expression visibly hardens as the low-slung school buildings come into view; his voice drops to a near monotone. I watch my son dampen down, toughen up. I watch him try to fit in. Despite his best efforts to hide his openness, older boys, bullies, have picked up the scent of emotional vulnerability in him, like a pheromone, and episodically over the years they have tortured him for it. The school protects Justin, and his mother and I arm him, as best we can. But in the mean game of inclusion/exclusion, ridicule and praise, in the socialization fields of the playground, Justin knows better than anyone that it is he alone who must make his way. Who am I to tell my son that he should keep his heart open as he threads his path to the classroom? And who am I to tell him that he should not? I don't begrudge Justin the emotional armor he dons each morning, the mask of feeling less, caring less, than he really does. It just makes me sad. </p><p> In the voices of those I work with in therapy, the men and women in the workshops I lead throughout the country, I hear a hunger for a way out of the dilemma of traditional masculinity, a roadmap toward something brighter, more whole. </p><p> If we weren't awake to the violence entwined with masculinity before, startling eruptions like those in Littleton, Colorado; Atlanta, Georgia; Santee, California, have made it difficult to ignore. "The fears of the father are transferred to the son. It was from my father to me and from me to my son. He already had it...I had to take him with me." So wrote a seemingly normal Atlanta stockbroker before he took his son's life, along with the lives of nine innocent people. </p><p> The alarming rise in men's violence and in boys' violence at first seems incomprehensible. But there is an old saying in Alcoholics Anonymous: "Hurt people hurt people." The transmutation of agony into rage, fear into attack, is neither foreign nor new to manhood. As a teacher and practitioner of family therapy for the past twenty years, I have seen the wages of what I call "toxic masculinity" -- the legacies of drinking, womanizing, depression, and fury -- sweep through whole generations like a fire in the wood, taking down everyone in its path until one man in one generation is graced with the courage to turn and face his demons, stemming the tide of injury passed from father to son. I write this book as one contribution to that force of courage and grace. I write as an emissary of a revolution, with the express purpose of engaging as many of you as I can to join in, to empower yourselves and those around you to shake off the illusions we have lived within for centuries. For, surprising as it might seem, what so profoundly alienates men is no different than what has disenfranchised women -- the system of patriarchy. </p><p> When the term <i>patriarchy</i> first entered the popular vernacular back in the 1960s and '70s, it conjured up images of male chauvinist pigs and radical, angry, bra-burning women. It was taken to mean the oppression of women by men. But early feminists like Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem also understood that the dynamics they unearthed did harm to both genders. The revolution of which I consider myself an emissary stands on the ground laid by that generation of women, and seeks to extend its insights. </p><p> In my work with men and women I distinguish between <i>political patriarchy,</i> which is the sexism that has been the target of most feminist writing, and what I term <i>psychological patriarchy. Psychological patriarchy</i> goes beyond the relationship between actual men and women -- as individuals or as a class. <i>Psychological patriarchy is the dynamic between those qualities deemed "masculine" and "feminine" in which half of our human traits are exalted while the other half is devalued. Both men and women participate in this tortured value system.</i> Psychological patriarchy is a "dance of contempt," a perverse form of connection that replaces true intimacy with complex, covert layers of dominance and submission, collusion and manipulation. It is the unacknowledged paradigm of relationship that has suffused Western civilization generation after generation, deforming both sexes, and destroying the passionate bond between them. </p><p> Here is the good news: the latest empirical research on both early infant relations and on adult optimal health indicates that, as a species, we are inherently wired for, and operate best in, a state of active, authentic connectedness. Even the tiniest infants, both male and female, show themselves eager, active participants in intimacy. Studies demonstrate that young children are innately connection-seeking, naturally sensitive readers of others' emotions, inherently compassionate and honest. In another domain, research on resilience, both physical and mental, reveals that rich authentic connection is one of the most salient factors in continued good health, outweighing such decisive forces as nutrition, exercise, even the absence of smoking. <i>We enter life whole and connected, and we operate best when richly attached. Intimacy is our natural state as a species, our birthright.</i> And yet, while the push away from genuine closeness occurs at different points in their development, and in critically different ways, neither boys nor girls are allowed to maintain healthy relatedness for very long. </p><p> As a culture, with no malevolent intent, following strictures we have all been raised within, we force our children out of the wholeness and connectedness in which they begin their lives. Instead of cultivating intimacy, turning nascent aptitudes into mature skills, we teach boys and girls, in complimentary ways, to bury their deepest selves, to stop speaking, or attending to, the truth, to hold in mistrust, or even in disdain, the state of closeness we all, by our natures, most crave. <i>We live in an antirelational, vulnerability-despis...</i></p></p><h2>Brotherhood of the Wolf (The Runelords)</h2><p>Volume Two of <i>The Runelords</i><br><br>Raj Ahtan, ruler of Indhopal, has used enough forcibles to transform himself into the ultimate warrior: The Sum of All Men. Ahtan seeks to bring all of humanity under his rule-destroying anything and anyone that stood in his path, including many friends and allies of young Prince Gaborn Val Orden. But Gaborn has fulfilled a two-thousand-year-old prophecy, becoming the Earth King-a mythic figure who can unleash the forces of the Earth itself. <br><br>And now the struggle continues. Gaborn has managed to drive off Raj Ahtan, but Ahtan is far from defeated. Striking at far-flung cities and fortresses and killing dedicates, Ahtan seeks to draw out the Earth King from his seat of power, to crush him. But as they weaken each other's forces in battle, the armies of an ancient and implacable inhuman enemy issue forth from the very bowels of the Earth.<br></p><p>David Farland's "Runelords" fantasy sequence began in 1998 with <i>The Sum of All Men</i>, a career-relaunch novel whose sales far outstripped earlier SF published under his real name Dave Wolverton. Runelords are supermen whose strength, stamina, and vision, and other physical abilities are multiplied by magical "endowments" transferred from unfortunate donors who are crippled by their loss: the archvillain in the story is virtually invincible thanks to tens of thousands of endowments. <p>This second book avoids middle-volume doldrums by introducing a vast onslaught of still tougher and memorably unpleasant nonhumans who even the villains must oppose. Meanwhile, various characters skirmish on different parts of the map, and the hero struggles with unreliable powers conferred on him when he was chosen as Earth King to save the land and humanity--or maybe only a tiny part of each. </p><p> Farland maintains a steady flow of new situations, reversals, gambits, and surprises ... it's a real shock when one chap who has incurred a dreadful penalty for virtuous reasons is not spared (as expected in the normal chivalry of fantasyland) but rather pays the full, eye-watering price. One small criticism: the writing contains occasional sloppiness and repetition. Nonetheless, this is a rousing, painfully gripping story. <i>--David Langford, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>Praise for David Farland's <i>The Runelords</i>:<p> "<i>The Runelords</i> heralds the arrival of a serious contender for the Jordan crown." --Michael Stackpole</p><p> "A first-rate tale, an epic fantasy that more than delivers on its promise. Read it soon and treat yourself to an adventure you won't forget." --Terry Brooks</p><p> "When I reached the end of this first volume and saw grace arise from a devastating battlefield where too many great hearts lay dead, Farland had earned the tears that came to my eyes. It was not sentiment but epiphany." --Orson Scott Card</p><p> "In <i>The Runelords</i> David Farland has created a vivid, detailed, different world that becomes perfectly believable. The characters are real, the action fast, and the sum a brilliant and engrossing novel." --David Drake</p><p> "David Farland is the single greatest discovery of my professional career." --Algis Budrys</p><p> "With <i>The Runelords</i>, David Farland breaks new ground in fantasy fiction and wakes up anyone who thought they'd read everything the genre had to offer." --Kevin J. Anderson</p><p> "A bloody, violent, grim saga, with thoughtfully devised magics and a well-turned plot...satisfying and involving." --<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p> "<i>The Runelords</i> is a wonderful fantasy novel." --Robert J. Sawyer</p><p> "The intriguing hook behind Farland's first novel--and launch of a new fantasy series--is a complex magical technology whereby abilities such as wit, brawn, and stamina are transferable from person to person. The magic is basic to Farland's story, not just painted on, and it and the society in which it plays out are rigorously and imaginatively elaborated." --<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p></p><h2>Culpeper&#39;s Color Herbal</h2><p>As charming and elegant as the 17th-century original, this groundbreaking herbal guide combines Nicholas Culpeper&#39;s fascinating text with up-to-date information and modern full-color illustrations.

Has this assistance improved the lives of Africans? No. In fact, across the continent, the recipients of this aid are not better off as a result of it, but worse&#x2014;much worse.<br><br>In <i>Dead Aid</i>, Dambisa Moyo describes the state of postwar development policy in Africa today and unflinchingly confronts one of the greatest myths of our time: that billions of dollars in aid sent from wealthy countries to developing African nations has helped to reduce poverty and increase growth. In fact, poverty levels continue to escalate and growth rates have steadily declined&#x2014;and millions continue to suffer. Provocatively drawing a sharp contrast between African countries that have rejected the aid route and prospered and others that have become aid-dependent and seen poverty increase, Moyo illuminates the way in which overreliance on aid has trapped developing nations in a vicious circle of aid dependency, corruption, market distortion, and further poverty, leaving them with nothing but the &#x201c;need&#x201d; for more aid. Debunking the current model of international aid promoted by both Hollywood celebrities and policy makers, Moyo offers a bold new road map for financing development of the world&#x2019;s poorest countries that guarantees economic growth and a significant decline in poverty&#x2014;without reliance on foreign aid or aid-related assistance.<br><br><i>Dead Aid</i> is an unsettling yet optimistic work, a powerful challenge to the assumptions and arguments that support a profoundly misguided development policy in Africa. And it is a clarion call to a new, more hopeful vision of how to address the desperate poverty that plagues millions.</p></p><p>Dambisa Moyo is the author of <i>How the West Was Lost</i>.

In the past fifty years, over US$1 trillion in development-related aid has been transferred from rich countries to Africa. In the past decade alone, on the back of Live 8, Make Poverty History, the Millennium Development Goals, the Millennium Challenge Account, the Africa Commission, and the 2005 G7 meeting (to name a few), millions of dollars each year have been raised in richer countries to support charities working for Africa. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>We are made to believe that this is what we ought to be doing. We are accosted on the streets and goaded with pleas on aeroplane journeys; letters flow through our mail boxes and countless television appeals remind us that we have a moral imperative to give more to those who have less. At the 2001 Labour conference, the UK's Prime Minister of the time, Tony Blair, remarked that 'The State of Africa is a scar on the conscience of the world', and that the West should 'provide more aid' as, thus far, amidst the multiple problems facing Africa, the continent had received inadequate amounts of aid.� <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Deep in every liberal sensibility is a profound sense that in a world of moral uncertainty one idea is sacred, one belief cannot be compromised: the rich should help the poor, and the form of this help should be aid. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>The pop culture of aid has bolstered these misconceptions. Aid has become part of the entertainment industry. Media figures, film stars, rock legends eagerly embrace aid, proselytize the need for it, upbraid us for not giving enough, scold governments for not doing enough - and governments respond in kind, fearful of losing popularity and desperate to win favour. Bono attends world summits on aid. Bob Geld of is, to use Tony Blair's own words, 'one of the people that I admire most'. Aid has become a cultural commodity. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Millions march for it. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Governments are judged by it. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>But has more than US$1 trillion in development assistance over the last several decades made African people better o.? No. In fact, across the globe the recipients of this aid are worse o.; much worse off Aid has helped make the poor poorer, and growth slower. Yet aid remains a centrepiece of today's development policy and one of the biggest ideas of our time. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>The notion that aid can alleviate systemic poverty, and has done so, is a myth. Millions in Africa are poorer today because of aid; misery and poverty have not ended but have increased. Aid has been, and continues to be, an unmitigated political, economic, and humanitarian disaster for most parts of the developing world. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>How this happened, how the world was gripped with an idea that seemed so right but was in fact so wrong, is what this book is about. Dead Aid is the story of the failure of post-war development policy. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Step by step it will dismantle the assumptions and arguments that have supported the single worst decision of modern developmental. politics, the choice of aid as the optimum solution to the problem of Africa's poverty. The evidence is as startling as it is obvious. It will contrast countries which have rejected the aid route and prospered with others which have become dependent on aid and been trapped in a vicious circle of corruption, market distortion and further poverty - and thus the 'need' for more aid. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Others before me have criticized aid. But the myth of its effectiveness persists. Dead Aid will offer a new model for financing development for the world's poorest countries: one that offers economic growth, promises to significantly reduce African poverty, and most importantly does not rely on aid. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>This book is not a counsel of despair. Far from it. The book offers another road; a road less travelled in Africa. Harder, more demanding, more difficult, but in the end the road to growth, prosperity, and independence for the continent. This book is about the aid-free solution to development: why it is right, why it has worked, why it is the only way forward for the world's poorest countries. <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Excerpted from DEAD AID by Dambisa MoyoCopyright � 2009 by Dambisa Moyo<br>Published in 2009 by Farrar, Straus and Giroux <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>All rights reserved.

Luckily, Rafe easily makes friends with his troublemaking cabin mates and bunkmate, a boy nicknamed Booger-Eater, who puts up with endless teasing from the other kids. Rafe soon realizes there's more to a person than a nickname, though, and Booger-Eater might be the kind of friend you want on your side when the boys from the Cool Cabin attack. <br><br>This fourth book in the massively popular Middle School series is an unforgettable summer of hi-jinks, new friends, and surprises, all told with the hilarity and honesty readers have come to expect from blockbuster author James Patterson. <br></p><p>James Patterson has had more <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers than any other writer, ever, according to <i>Guinness World Records</i>. Since his first novel won the Edgar Award in 1977 James Patterson's books have sold more than 300 million copies. He is the author of the Alex Cross novels<b>,</b> the most popular detective series of the past twenty-five years, including <i>Kiss the Girls </i>and <i>Along Came a Spider</i>. He writes full-time and lives in Florida with his family.<br></p><h2>A Breach of Promise</h2><p>In a sensational breach of promise suit, two wealthy social climbers are suing on behalf of their beautiful daughter, Zillah. The defendant is Zillah&#39;s alleged fianc�, brilliant young architect Killian Melville, who adamantly declares that he will not, cannot, marry her. Utterly baffled by his client&#39;s refusal, Melville&#39;s counsel, Sir Oliver Rathbone, turns to his old comrades in crime--investigator William Monk and nurse Hester Latterly. But even as they scout London for clues, the case suddenly and tragically ends. An outcome that no one--except a ruthless murderer--could have foreseen.</p><p>The promises that are breached, broken, and never born in Anne Perry's rich and resonant new William Monk mystery all have to do with the roles and positions of women in Victorian society. At the center of the book is a rousing courtroom drama, as young Zillah Lambert--daughter of a wealthy, well-meaning northern businessman and his socially ambitious wife--sues an immensely gifted architect, Killian Melville. Melville, Zillah argues, failed to live up to his promise of marriage and thereby ruined her chances of making any sort of acceptable match. Private detective Monk is brought into the case by lawyer Oliver Rathbone when his client (Melville), facing financial and social ruin, still refuses to offer any reason for his dastardly conduct.<p> Monk's attentions are occupied elsewhere, too. Hester Latterly, the courageous nurse who worked with Florence Nightingale in the Crimean War, and whose favors Monk and Rathbone both desire, is looking after a British officer, Gabriel Sheldon, who was badly wounded and disfigured in India. Gabriel's wife, Perdita, is having trouble adjusting to her husband's broken body and spirit. "It was not Perdita's fault that she was confused and frightened," Monk muses. "She had been protected all her short life. She had not chosen to be, it was her assigned role." Monk has also promised a housemaid in the Sheldons' service that he will look for her two little nieces--deaf and deformed from birth--who were abandoned by their mother almost 20 years before. As the cases tangle and combine (perhaps a tad too coincidentally for some tastes, but, then again, real life is full of coincidences), Perry manages to show us the many ways in which women were made to pay for their place in a male-dominated society. She also delivers a touching and surprisingly suspenseful story.

One of the best perks of my job is getting sneak previews of upcoming books, and I take full advantage of that perk with Anne Perry's novels. As any follower of the William Monk series knows, the somewhat triangular relationship shared by Monk, nurse Hester Latterly, and barrister Oliver Rathbone is one of the enduring themes of the series. Although I read the William Monk novels for the edge-of-your-seat suspense and fascinating historical detail that Anne Perry is known for, I also read the series to find out the answer to the burning question: what will happen to them next? Well, when the bound galleys for A BREACH OF PROMISE came out, I immediately took one home with me for the weekend and read, spellbound, for two days. Let me tell you: this one has a kicker of an ending. For anyone who wants to know the answer to that question, you must read this book!<br><br>--Malinda Lo, Editorial Assistant<br></p><h2>Life in the Iron Mills and Other Stories</h2><p>This 1861 classic of social realism the first book to be reprinted by the Feminist Press in its series of rediscovered women writers remains a powerful evocation of what Davis herself called thwarted, wasted lives . . . mighty hungers . . . and unawakened powers."

Yet people continue to find him one of the most joyful and hopeful people they have encountered. In Made for Goodness, Tutu shares his source of strength and optimism. Written with his daughter, Mpho, who is also an ordained Anglican minister, Tutu argues that God has made us for goodness, and when we simply start walking in the direction of this calling, God is there to meet us, encourage us, embrace us. God has made the world as a grand theater for us to work out this call to goodness; it is up to us to live up to this calling, but God is there to help us every step of the way. So tackling our worst problems takes on new meaning and is bostered with hope and the expectation that that is exactly where God will show up. Father and daughter offer an inspiring message of hope that will transform readers into activists for change and blessing.</p><p><p>We know all too well the cruelties, hurts, and hatreds that poison life on our planet. But my daughter and I have come together to write this book because we know that the catalogue of injuries that we can and do inflict on one another is not the whole story of humanity, not by a long measure. We are indeed made for something more. We are made for goodness.<br>&#x2014;from <em>Made for Goodness</em></p><p>Over the years the same questions get asked of Desmond Tutu, the archbishop, Nobel Peace Prize winner, and veteran of the moral movement that ended apartheid in South Africa: "How can you be so hopeful after witnessing so much evil?" "Why are you so sure goodness will triumph in the end?" This book is his answer.</p><p>Now, more than any other time in history, our world needs this message: that we are made for goodness and it is up to us to live up to our destiny.</p><p>We recognize Archbishop Tutu from the headlines as an inspirational figure who has witnessed some of the world's most sinister moments and chosen to be an ambassador of reconciliation amid political, diplomatic, and natural disasters. Now, we get a glimpse into his personal spirituality&#x2014;and a better understanding of the man behind a lifetime of good works. In this intimate and personal sharing of his heart, written with his daughter, Episcopal priest Mpho Tutu, Tutu engages his reader with touching stories from his own life, as well as grisly memories from his work in the darkest corners of the world. There, amid the darkness, he calls us to hope, to joy, and to claim the goodness that we were made for. Tutu invites us to take on the disciplines of goodness, the practices that are key to finding fulfillment, meaning, and happiness for our lives.</p><p>Desmond Mpilo Tutu was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984. In 1986 he was elected archbishop of Cape Town, the highest position in the Anglican Church in South Africa. In 1994, after the end of apartheid and the election of Nelson Mandela, Tutu was appointed as chair of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate apartheid-era crimes. His policy of forgiveness and reconciliation has become an international example of conflict resolution and a trusted method of postconflict reconstruction. He is currently the chair of The Elders, where he gives vocal defense of human rights and campaigns for the oppressed. </p></p><h2>Jerome Robbins: A Life in Dance (Jewish Lives)</h2><p><b>A lively and </b><b>inspired</b><b> biography celebrating the centennial of this master choreographer, dancer, and stage director</b><br><br> Jerome Robbins (1918&#x2013;1998) was born Jerome Wilson Rabinowitz and grew up in Weehawken, New Jersey, where his Russian-Jewish immigrant parents owned the Comfort Corset Company. Robbins, who was drawn to dance at a young age, resisted the idea of joining the family business. In 1936 he began working with Gluck Sandor, who ran a dance group and convinced him to change his name to Jerome Robbins. He went on to become a choreographer and director who worked in ballet, on Broadway, and in film.

Rachel decides to borrow potatoes from Mrs. Greenberg. She asks Mrs. Greenberg, who is all alone, to come for Hanukkah. But Mrs. Greenberg is very stubborn!</p><p>Of the many joys of Hanukkah, the joining of family and friends is perhaps the greatest. This is why young Rachel and her family are especially eager to have their dear elderly neighbor Mrs. Greenberg over for Hanukkah dinner. But every year their neighbor refuses, not wanting to be a bother. One year, on the last night of Hanukkah, Rachel's mother discovers that she has run out of potatoes for the latkes. Maybe Mrs. Greenberg will come for dinner if we borrow some of her potatoes, suggests Rachel. And off she runs into the snowy purple night to see if her plan will work. Author Linda Glaser (<i>Rosie's Birthday Rat</i>) has a keen understanding of a child's perspective: "Mrs. Greenberg's house was always clean and tidy, like its face was just scrubbed and its blouse was tucked in, while Rachel's house always looked like it was still in its pajamas and needed to brush its hair yet." Rachel succeeds in procuring the potatoes, but it takes a "stubborn-as-an-ox" girl to get a "stubborn-as-an-ox" woman to share their Hanukkah dinner. Rachel's ingenious eventual entrapment of Mrs. Greenberg--along with her rosy red cheeks and unruly orange braids--make her an excellent ambassador for a story about the heart of Hanukkah. Lively, cartoonish illustrations by Nancy Cote enliven this already vivacious holiday tale.

This indispensable collection of forty-eight pieces from his brilliant oeuvre includes selections from classics such as <i>Ever Since Darwin</i> and <i>The Mismeasure of Man</i>, plus articles and speeches never before published in book form.<br><br> This volume, the last that will bear his name, spotlights his elegance, depth, and sheer pleasure in our world&#x2015;a true celebration of an extraordinary mind. 20 illustrations</p><p><p><strong>Stephen Jay Gould</strong> (1941-2002) was the Alexander Agassiz Professor of Zoology and Professor of Geology at Harvard University.

Long active in the politics of sciences, their joint books include <i>Science and Society</i> and <i>Alas Poor Darwin</i>.</p>Adult/High School&#x2014;One of the most widely known and accessible of science writers, Gould reveled in living in a period of rapid scientific progress. Exploring this "best of all enterprises at the best of all possible times," he communicates his wonder and enthusiasm. The editor draws from hundreds of essays published from the 1970s until the scientist's death in 2002, organizing his choices into eight sections. The book starts with some of the best-loved autobiographical pieces (for example, Gould's scientific attitude defines his fight with cancer; he illustrates problems in statistics through examples in his favorite sport, baseball). Subsequent essays offer insights and anecdotes about other scientists, and then represent key points in the evolutionary scientist's career. In the final sections, Gould focuses his laser eye on the blunders and misunderstandings when sociology, psychology, culture, and religion have interacted with and impinged upon one another. The informative and provocative essays on topics like racism, misogyny, and creationism (including "Darwin and the Munchkins of Kansas") are sure to spark discussion. Readers browsing this volume will be fascinated and inspired by the man's creativity-and swept away by the surprising and often humorous tactics he employs to draw them in. Though his many other books are likely to stay in print, this anthology presents, with a Gould-like liveliness and breadth of perspective, a taste of his entire lifetime of insight. For collections that have room for only one volume of his writing, this is the essential one.&#x2014;<i>Christine C.

From Big Ben to the grimy Victorian streets of Dickens novels on up to the sleek high-rises that dot the skyline of the twenty-first-century metropolis, the urban landscape of London is steeped in history, while forever responsive to the changing dictates of progress, industry, and culture. In <i>London</i><i>: A Life in Maps</i>, acclaimed historian Peter Whitfield reveals a wealth of surprising truths and forgotten facts hidden in the city&#x2019;s historic maps.<br>&nbsp;Whitfield examines nearly 200 maps spanning the last 500 years, all of which vividly demonstrate the vast changes wrought on London&#x2019;s streets, open spaces, and buildings. In a rich array of colorful cartographic illustrations, the maps chronicle London&#x2019;s tumultuous history, from the devastation of the Great Fire to the indelible marks left by World Wars&nbsp;I and&nbsp;II to the emergence of the West End as a fashion mecca. Whitfield reads historic sketches and detailed plans as biographical keys to this complex, sprawling urban center, and his in-depth examination unearths fascinating insights into the city of black cabs and red double-deckers. With engaging prose and astute analysis&nbsp;he also&nbsp;expertly coaxes out the subtle complexities&#x2014;of social history, urban planning, and design&#x2014;within the rich documentation of London&#x2019;s immense and constantly changing cityscape.<i></i><br><i>London</i><i>: A Life in Maps</i> lets readers&nbsp;wander through the past and present of&nbsp;London&#x2019;s celebrated streets&#x2014;from Abbey Road to Savile Row&#x2014;and along the way reveals the city&#x2019;s captivating history, vibrant culture, and potential future.</p><p><b>Peter Whitfield</b> is former director of Stanfords International Map Centre in London.

Whitfield serves up an enjoyable mix of facts, both familiar and obscure, handsomely supported with contemporary illustrations in addition to the maps. . . . Anyone with an interest in the history of London or of maps generally will find much to enjoy. Recommended highly for public and academic libraries." (Linda M. Kaufmann <i>Library Journal</i> 2007-10-15)<br><br>"[<i>London</i>] provides the reader with a good understanding of the evolution of one of the world's major cities, and includes many of the seminal maps for those interested in its cartographic history. It is a good book for just browsing the maps and illustrations, and it's appropriate for anyone with an interest in London and/or maps. . . . A very good value."

Early in his tenure with the agency, he learns about a former operative, Bobby Goldstein, and becomes curious about the case that led to his termination. Before he can get to the bottom of what happened, however, he's shipped off to [REDACTED], where he hobnobs with foreign diplomats and informants, who have access to [REDACTED] information and contacts like the powerful General [REDACTED], in the hopes of recruiting them as agents. But, when he falls for the wrong woman, he's quickly sent back to [REDACTED], with nothing to show for his secretive work but a mysterious postcard with an unknown address on it. Who sent the postcard, and where is it supposed to lead him? Could this all be an ops test, with Mark's future hanging in the balance? Soon, he'll have to decide if righting an old wrong is worth taking a terrible and very personal risk. Published with redacted material throughout the novel, <i>An Ordinary Spy </i>is a riveting and dramatic portrait of modern espionage, filled with suspense, intrigue, and betrayal.</p></p><p><p><b>Joseph Weisberg </b>is the author of the critically acclaimed <i>10th Grade</i>, which was a 2002 <i>New York Times </i>Notable Book. A former CIA officer, he grew up in Chicago and currently lives in New York City.</p>Mimicking many nonfiction books about the CIA, Weisberg, a former CIA officer, has included a blizzard of redacted (blacked out) words and sentences in his second novel (after <i>10th Grade</i>), as if the agency's publications review board had worked the manuscript over with a heavy hand. Did they? Or is it just a clever ploy for verisimilitude? Mark Ruttenberg, a newly minted agent, is on his first foreign assignment trying to persuade citizens of an unknown country (the location has been redacted) to spy for American interests. He's doing well until he starts sleeping with one of his contacts and his superiors eventually fire him. Back in America, Ruttenberg meets another cashiered spy, Bobby Goldstein, and the two men share their experiences. Ruttenberg and Goldstein may be pretty ordinary spies, as the title suggests, but their stories compel, thanks to the author's deft prose and insider expertise. Given the quantity of blacked-out material, some readers may be more annoyed than intrigued as they puzzle over the missing information. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Ayya Khema, author of the best-selling <i>Being Nobody, Going Nowhere</i>, uses one of the earliest Buddhist <i>suttas</i> to guide us along the path of the oldest Buddhist meditative practice for understanding the nature of "self." By following the Buddha's explanation with clear, insightful examples from her years of teaching meditation, she guides us back and forth between the relative understanding and higher realizations of the Buddhist concept of "self." Her thoughtful contemplation of the Buddha's radical understanding of "self" and her practical advice for achieving insight offer the reader a profound understanding of the "self." Both beginning and advanced practitioners will greatly benefit from Ayya Khema's warm and down-to-earth exposition of the Buddha's meditation on "self."</p><p>In this beautifully crafted guide to one of the Buddha&#39;s most famous teachings, Ayya Khema leads you, as the Buddha led his disciple Potthapada, through progressively higher levels of understanding and realization of the true nature of the &#34;self&#34;. Interpreting this famous discourse with insightful examples from her years of teaching meditation, she guides you along the path of perhaps the most effective Buddhist meditative practice for personal transformation. Along the way you will learn about the language, customs, and culture of the era in which the Buddha gave his discourses and be surprised at how pertinent this 2500 year-old teaching is for you and your world.Born in Berlin in 1923 to Jewish parents, Ayya Khema was educated in Scotland and China and later emigrated to the United States. The author of twenty-five books, she was ordained as a nun in Sri Lanka in 1979 and established several Buddhist centers, including Wat Buddha Dhamma in Australia, Parapuddua Nun&#39;s Island in Sri Lanka, and Buddha Haus in Germany. In 1987 she coordinated the first-ever International Conference of Buddhist Nuns.

It targets insulin, the hormone that regulates blood sugar levels. The bodies of most overeaters are continually in a state of hyperinsulinism; their bodies are so adept at releasing insulin to help convert excess carbohydrates to fat that there's always too much of the hormone circulating through the body. This puts the body into a bind; it always wants to store fat. Even when people with hyperinsulinism try to lose weight--especially when they cut fat but increase carbohydrate consumption--their efforts will fail. This is why Dr. Atkins refers to insulin as "the fat-producing hormone." <p> Dr. Atkins's diet is extremely low in carbohydrates, which helps to regulate insulin production and decrease circulating insulin; less insulin soon results in less fat storage and fewer food cravings. The diet is far from torturous, though--those who've tried it attest that hunger is <i>not</i> a part of this plan. Ninety percent of Dr. Atkins's patients--more than 25,000 of them--have experienced dramatic weight loss. The book includes recipes for such luscious, low-carb dishes as lobster soup, zabaglione, sea bass, and blueberry ice cream, and even includes a carbohydrate gram counter and menus.</p><p>Robert C. Atkins, M.D., was the founder and Executive Medical Director of The Atkins Center for Complementary Medicine in New York City. His groundbreaking weight loss book, <em>Diet Revolution</em>, was the first major work to prescribe a low-carbohydrate diet.

Many feel intimidated by the act of writing, and some don't enjoy writing. In <i>Storytelling for Grantseekers</i>, Second Edition, Cheryl Clarke presents an organic approach to grantseeking, one that views the process through the lens of the pleasures and rewards of crafting a good story. Grantseekers who approach the process as one in which they are connecting with an audience (grantmakers) and writing a narrative (complete with settings, characters, antagonists and resolutions) find greater success with funders. The writing process becomes a rewarding way to tell the organization's tale, rather than a chore, and their passion and creativity lead to winning proposals. <p>This book walks readers through all the main phases of the proposal, highlighting the creative elements that link components to each other and unify the entire proposal. The book contains resources on crafting an effective synopsis, overcoming grantwriter's block, packaging the story, and the best ways to approach the "short stories" (inquiry and cover letters) that support the larger proposal.</p> <p>Clarke also stresses the need to see proposal-writing as part of a larger grantseeking effort, one that emphasizes preparation, working with the entire development staff, and maintaining good relations with funders. In Storytelling for Grantseekers, new and experienced grantseekers alike will discover how to write and support successful proposals with humor and passion.</p> <p>New edition features:</p> <ul> <li>Overall updates as well as both refreshed and new examples</li> <li>Workshop exercises for using the storytelling approach</li> <li>New chapters on the application of the storytelling method to other fundraising communications like appeal letters and case statements, as well as the importance of site visits</li> <li>Example of a full narrative proposal</li> </ul></p><p><p><b>STORYTELLING FOR GRANTSEEKERS</b> </p><p>This second edition of the best-selling book<i> Storytelling for Grantseekers</i> contains all the resources and information needed to help craft a persuasive summary, package a compelling narrative story, and create a short story approach to letters of inquiry.

It was a time when injustice was met by a lust for vengeance, and rarely was a distinction made between the innocent and the guilty. Against this tumultuous historical backdrop, Dickens' great story of unsurpassed adventure and courage unfolds. Unjustly imprisoned for 18 years in the Bastille, Dr. Alexandre Manette is reunited with his daughter, Lucie, and safely transported from France to England. It would seem that they could take up the threads of their lives in peace. As fate would have it though, the pair are summoned to the Old Bailey to testify against a young Frenchman &#x2014; Charles Darnay &#x2014; falsely accused of treason. Strangely enough, Darnay bears an uncanny resemblance to another man in the courtroom, the dissolute lawyer's clerk Sydney Carton. It is a coincidence that saves Darnay from certain doom more than once. Brilliantly plotted, the novel is rich in drama, romance, and heroics that culminate in a daring prison escape in the shadow of the guillotine. &#x201c;It was the best of times, it was the worst of times&#x201d;, those days in which your English Literature professor ordered you to read &#x201c;A Tale of Two Cities&#x201d; by Charles Dickens. You were immediately confounded by the perplexity of the story and confused by the language of the times. In your despair, you struggled, endeavored and persevered to reach the conclusion of the classic novel. Having satisfactorily completed the requirements of that difficult semester, you vowed to never again read classic English literature. As the years accumulated, you garnered wisdom and spirituality as you aged and you gathered far greater literary acumen. Your mind was transformed and you began to yearn for the great stories that could only be told by the true masters. Anon, you found yourself immersed in the incredible classic writings of Charles Dickens. For no one could so completely transport you to the mean filthy streets of Oliver Twist&#x2019;s London or the horror and dread of The Reign of Terror in that unfortunate tale of London and Paris in the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety-three. No other writer could place you so deeply into the mind of a tyrannical boss such as Ebenezer Scrooge or imbue the viciousness of a violent revolutionary the likes of Madame Defarge. Contemporary writers only wish they had the amazing ability to create magnificent unlikely heroes and fantastic characters whose flame of eternal hope burned against an all consuming darkness.</p><p>The classic, definitive, world-famous Nonesuch Press edition of 1937, finally available again and bound in leather and linen. The text in these stunning volumes is taken from the 1867 Chapman and Hall edition, which became known as the Charles Dickens edition and was the last edition to be corrected by the author himself. The Nonesuch edition contains full-color illustrations selected by Dickens himself, by artists including Hablot Knight Browne ("Phiz"), George Cruikshank, John Leech, Robert Seymour, and George Cattermole.<br><br> <i>The Nonesuch Dickens</i> reproduces the original elegance of these beautiful editions. Books are printed on natural cream-shade high quality stock, quarter bound in bonded leather with cloth sides, include a ribbon marker, and feature special printed endpapers. Each volume is wrapped in a protective, clear acetate jacket.<br><br> The books are available as individual volumes, or as sets. The six-volume set contains <i>Oliver Twist, Bleak House, Christmas Books, Nicholas Nickleby, David Copperfield,</i> and <i>Great Expectations</i> together with <i>Hard Times</i>. The three-volume set contains <i>A Tale of Two Cities, Little Dorrit,</i> and <i>The Life and Adventures of Martin Chuzzlewit</i>.With his sublime parting words, &#34;It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done...&#34; Sidney Carton joins that exhalted group of Dickensian characters who have earned a permanent place in the popular literary imagination. His dramatic story, set against the volcanic fury of the French Revolution and pervaded by the ominous rumble of the death carts trundling toward the guillotine, is the heart-stirring tale of a heroic soul in an age gone mad. A masterful pageant of idealism, love, and adventure -- in a Paris bursting with revolutionary frenzy, and a London alive with anxious anticipation -- &#34;A Tale of Two Cities is one of Dickens&#39;s most energetic and exciting works.</p><h2>Anthology of Modern American Poetry</h2><p><em>Anthology of Modern American Poetry</em> contains more than 750 poems by 161 American poets, including many who have not been anthologized before.

Spurgeon, the beloved preacher and writer, few are familiar with the life and legacy of his wife, Susie.&nbsp; Yet Susannah Spurgeon was an accomplished and devout woman of God who had a tremendous ministry in her own right, as well as in support of her husband. Even while dealing with serious health issues, she administered a book fund for poor pastors, edited and published her husband&#x2019;s sermons and other writings, led a pastor&#x2019;s aid ministry, wrote five books, made her home a hub of hospitality, and was instrumental in planting a church. And as her own writing attests, she was also a warm, charming, and fascinating woman. </p><p>Now, for the first time, <i>Susie </i>brings this vibrant woman&#x2019;s story to modern readers.

But oh! That empty chair! That great portrait over the door! The strange, solemn silence, which pervades the place now that he is no longer on earth! I kneel sometimes by his chair, and laying my head on the cushioned arms, which so long supported his dear form, I pour out my grief before the Lord, and tell Him again that though I am left alone, yet I know that &#x2018;He hath done all things well&#x2019;...&#x201d;</i></p></p><p><p><i>&#x201c;He gave into her hands a solemn charge&#x2014;to help fellow-pilgrims along the road, filling her life with blessed interest, and healing her own deep sorrow by giving her power to relieve and comfort others.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>-Susie Spurgeon, reflecting upon her life after Charles&#x2019;s death</i></p><p>Most of us know the name of Charles Spurgeon, London&#x2019;s most famous preacher, but few know the name (or story) of his wife, Susie. Yet she is well worth knowing. &nbsp;</p><p>Susie wrote books, founded and managed a book fund for impoverished pastors, reared twin boys, and was instrumental in planting a church after Charles died&#x2014;all while battling crippling health problems. She cultivated an exceptional romance with Charles and played a key role in his ministry. Her resilience, kind and generous spirit, and her love for Jesus and His Church will embolden you to aspire to more in the Christian life.</p><p>In this definitive biography, Ray Rhodes does the work of a historian with all the grace and craft of the storyteller.

Written by the first black executive secretary of the NAACP,&nbsp;<i>The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man</i>, in its depiction of turn-of-the-century New York, anticipates the social realism of the Harlem Renaissance writers. In its unprecedented analysis of the social causes of a black man's denial of the best within himself, it is perhaps James Weldon Johnson's greatest service to his race.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.<br><br></p></p><p>With the possible exceptions of Dr. Alain Locke and W.E.B. Du Bois, no African American excelled on as many different levels as James Weldon Johnson. <i>Along This Way</i>--the first autobiography by a person of color to be reviewed in <i>The New York Times</i>--not only chronicles his life as an educator, lawyer, diplomat, newspaper editor, lyricist, poet, essayist, and political activist but also outlines the trials and triumphs of African Americans from post-Reconstruction to the rise and fall of the Harlem Renaissance. Born in Florida in 1871 to middle-class West Indian parents, Johnson recognized the challenges and absurdities of segregated America early on. But it was his experience as a tutor to rural blacks while a student at Atlanta University that was to alter the course of his life: "It was this period that marked the beginning of psychological change from boyhood to manhood," he writes. "It was this period that marked also the beginning of my knowledge of my own people as a race." <p> With a rare blend of pride and humility, Johnson recounts how he, among other accomplishments, became Florida's first black lawyer in 1898, a diplomat in Venezuela and Nicaragua, and lyricist for his brother Rosamond Johnson's famous song, "Lift Every Voice and Sing." Johnson's commentary on his epochal novel, <i>The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man</i>, as well as writings on his works of poetry--<i>The Creation</i>, <i>God's Trombones</i>, and <i>Fifty Years and Other Poems</i>--is priceless. Equally important are the logical and even-tempered opinions on race that he wrote for <i>The New York Age</i>, which offered comprehensive critiques of Du Bois, Booker T. Washington, and Marcus Garvey, along with his analysis of the racial climate while serving as head of the NAACP. This remarkable man left a mark on the 20th century that goes beyond the boundary of race. <i>--Eugene Holley Jr.</i></p>First published anonymously in 1912, this resolutely unsentimental novel gave many white readers their first glimpse of the double standard -- and double consciousness -- that ruled the lives of black people in modern America. Republished in 1927, at the height of the Harlem Renaissance, with an introduction by Carl Van Vechten, The Autobiography of an Ex-Coloured Man became a groundbreaking document of Afro-American culture; the first first-person novel ever written by a black, it became an eloquent model for later novelists ranging from Zora Neale Hurston to Richard Wright and Ralph Ellison. <br>Narrated by a man whose light skin enables him to "pass" for white, the novel describes a journey through the strata of black society at the turn of the century -- from a cigar factory in Jacksonville to an elite gambling club in New York, from genteel aristocrats to the musicians who hammered out the rhythms of ragtime. The Autobiography of an Ex-Coloured Man is a complex and moving examination of the question of race and an unsparing look at what it meant to forge an identity as a man in a culture that recognized nothing but color.</p><h2>501 Arabic Verbs: Fully Conjugated in All Forms</h2><p>Barron's <i> 501 Arabic Verbs </i> is printed in Arabic script with exemplary sentences in English for each verb.

This accessible text will help you to better understand the connection between human service research and practice. APPLIED SOCIAL RESEARCH brings the subject to life and explores how recent innovations in technology are affecting research methods and results.</p><p>&#34;An excellent and user-friendly guide to understanding social research, particularly for those students who are intimidated by research.&#34;</p><h2>Ghost In The Shell, Vol. 1, 2nd Edition</h2><p>Deep into the 21st century, the line between man and machine has been inexorably blurred as humans rely on the enhancement of mechanical implants and robots are upgraded with human tissue. In this rapidly converging landscape, cyborg super-agent Major Motoko Kusanagi is charged to track down the craftiest and most dangerous terrorists and cybercriminals, including &#34;ghost hackers,&#34; capable of exploiting the human/machine interface by re-programming human minds to become puppets to carry out their criminal ends. When Major Kusanagi tracks the cybertrail of one such master hacker, the Puppeteer, her quest leads her into a world beyond information and technology where the very nature of consciousness and the human soul are turned upside-down and inside-out.</p><p>Starred Review. First published in English in 1995, this classic cyberpunk manga is the story of a future society dependent on cyborgs (humans with machine parts). It's 2029, and Japan has gathered a troop of military cyborgs in Section Nine, a secret paramilitary security squad. The S-9 squad leader is the tall and sexy female cyborg Major Kusanagi, and the men under her command include the gruff Batou and the uncertain (and mostly human) rookie Togusa. Bafflingly metaphysical and utterly gripping, the book is an episodic chronicle of S-9's missions that illustrates the fluid nature of crime, espionage and geopolitical skullduggery in a world where human personality, vast data networks and cybernetic technology have essentially fused into a single social matrix. The team tracks criminals, spies and terrorists who hack networks or illegally copy the ghosts (or souls) of enslaved humans into black market cyborgs. Their ultimate case is the Puppeteer, a deadly cyberterrorist who turns out to be a ghostless, "self-aware" artificial intelligence spontaneously created out of the vast sea of networked information. Masamune's b&amp;w drawings are dynamic and beautifully gestural; he vividly renders the awesome urban landscape of a futuristic, supertechnological Japan.

From kindergarten to college, American boys are, on average, less resilient and less ambitious than they were a mere twenty years ago. The gender gap in college attendance and graduation rates has widened dramatically. While Emily is working hard at school and getting A's, her brother Justin is goofing off. He's more concerned about getting to the next level in his videogame than about finishing his homework.<br>In <i>Boys Adrift</i>, Dr. Leonard Sax delves into the scientific literature and draws on more than twenty years of clinical experience to explain why boys and young men are failing in school and disengaged at home. He shows how social, cultural, and biological factors have created an environment that is literally toxic to boys. He also presents practical solutions, sharing strategies which educators have found effective in re-engaging these boys at school, as well as handy tips for parents about everything from homework, to videogames, to medication.<br></p><p><b>Leonard Sax MD PhD </b>graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) at the age of 19, and then went on to the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned both a PhD in psychology, and an MD. He completed a 3-year residency in family practice in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. For 19 years, Dr. Sax was a practicing family physician in Maryland, just outside Washington DC. In 2005, Doubleday published his first book&nbsp;<i>Why Gender Matters;&nbsp;</i>an updated edition was published in 2017<i>.&nbsp;</i>His second book,<i>Boys Adrift</i>, was published in 2007; an updated edition was published in 2016. His third book Girls on the Edge was published in 2010. His fourth book&nbsp;<i>The Collapse of Parenting</i>&nbsp;was published by Basic Books in December 2015 and became a New York Times bestseller.&nbsp;<br>Dr. Sax has spoken on issues of child and adolescent development not only in the United States but also in Australia, Bermuda, Canada, England, Germany, Italy, Mexico, New Zealand, Scotland, Spain, and Switzerland. He has visited more than 400 schools since 2001. He has appeared on the TODAY Show, CNN, National Public Radio, Fox News, PBS, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the British Broadcasting Corporation, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, New Zealand Television, and many other national and international media.&nbsp;<br>Dr. Sax now lives with his wife and daughter in Chester County, Pennsylvania. He returned to clinical practice, in Pennsylvania, in 2013. His favorite activities are hiking in the woods, and making music with his wife and daughter.

Kingdon&#39;s landmark work on agenda setting and policy formation is now offered in a Longman Classics Edition. This enduring work of original research, drawn from interviews with people in the U.S. federal government over the course of four years, examines the questions of how issues get to be issues for legislators. The book grapples with the questions: How do subjects come to officials&#39; attention? How are the alternatives from which they choose generated? How is the governmental agenda set? Why does an idea&#39;s time come when it does? Hailed as one of the finest books about public policy- making, and winner of the 1994 Aaron Wildavsky Award, this book&#39;s rich detail and engaging prose make it a text that both students and instructors will savor.</p><p></p><h2>CBT Made Simple: A Clinician&#x2019;s Guide to Practicing Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (The New Harbinger Made Simple Series)</h2><p><p><b>In <i>CBT Made Simple</i>, two psychologists and experts in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) offer the ultimate &#x201c;how-to&#x201d; manual based on the principles of effective adult learning.

Women have been discharged from the emergency room mid-heart attack with a prescription for anti-anxiety meds, while others with autoimmune diseases have been labeled &#x201c;chronic complainers&#x201d; for years before being properly diagnosed. Women with endometriosis have been told they are just overreacting to &#x201c;normal&#x201d; menstrual cramps, while still others have &#x201c;contested&#x201d; illnesses like chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia that, dogged by psychosomatic suspicions, have yet to be fully accepted as &#x201c;real&#x201d; diseases by the whole of the profession.</p><p>An eye-opening read for patients and health care providers alike, <em>Doing Harm</em> shows how women suffer because the medical community knows relatively less about their diseases and bodies and too often doesn&#x2019;t trust their reports of their symptoms. The research community has neglected conditions that disproportionately affect women and paid little attention to biological differences between the sexes in everything from drug metabolism to the disease factors&#x2014;even the symptoms of a heart attack. Meanwhile, a long history of viewing women as especially prone to &#x201c;hysteria&#x201d; reverberates to the present day, leaving women battling against a stereotype that they&#x2019;re hypochondriacs whose ailments are likely to be &#x201c;all in their heads.&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><p>Offering a clear-eyed explanation of the root causes of this insidious and entrenched bias and laying out its sometimes catastrophic consequences, <em>Doing Harm </em>is a rallying wake-up call that will change the way we look at health care for women.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><strong>MAYA DUSENBERY</strong> is a writer and editor of the award-winning site Feministing.com.

This second edition includes a new 90-page Introduction, "New York City in 1960," in which the authors, with all their previous depth and verve, examine the turn of events since 1963, the date of the first edition. Their concerns are directed to such developments as the rise of militant black demands and the response to these of the city's peoples and political structures; the decline of Catholic power in Lindsay's New York and the rise in power of Jews and WASPs; the growth of a black middle class and the economic and political difficulties of the Puerto Ricans. The authors note that events and further study have led them to change their views on several matters, and these points are clarified in the Introduction. Nevertheless, most of their perceptions and their central thesis (that "melting pot" assimilation does not happen) remain as valid as ever. In the same way, these appraisals of the first edition remain fully in force: Richard H. Rovere, The New Yorker: "Beyond the Melting Pot... is perhaps the most perceptive inquiry into American minorities ever made." Oscar Handlin, New York Times: "They have put together a thoughtful analysis that will help Americans deal with one of the most pressing problems of the great cities. That itself is a substantial accomplishment." Harpers Magazine: "... sure in its grasp of relations between economic and social fact, cogent, complex, and brightly written." Time Magazine: "... provocative... Glazer... and Moynihan... write with a refreshing candor on a subject that is usually treated all too delicately.... They write compassionately of the problems minority groups have faced, but they forthrightly point out that many of these problems are compounded by each group's special characteristics."</p></p><p>Nathan Glazer, a Fellow of the American Academy since 1969, has written extensively on issues of ethnicity and race in American society.

He introduces the concepts of the &#39;magic of&#39; units and objectives, of emotion memory, of the super-objective and many more now famous rehearsal aids.&#34;An Actor must work all his life, cultivate his mind, train his talents systematically, develop his character; he may never despair and never relinquish this main pupose - to love his art with all his strength and love it unselfishly.&#34; (Constantin Stanislavski)</p><p>So much mystery and veneration surrounds the writings of the great Russian teacher and director Stanislavski that perhaps the greatest surprise awaiting a first-time reader of <i>An Actor Prepares</i> is how conversational, commonsensical, and even at times funny this legendary book is. After many productions with the Moscow Arts Company, Stanislavski sought a way to introduce his new style of acting to the world outside of his rehearsal hall. The resulting book is a "mock diary" of an actor describing a series of exercises and rehearsals in which he participates. He details his own emotional and intellectual reactions to each effort, and how his superficial tricks and mannerisms begin to disappear as he increasingly gives over his conscious ego to a faith in the creative power of his subconscious. Rarely has any writer on the theater achieved the sort of lucid and inspired analysis of the acting process as Stanislavski does here, and his introduction of such now-standard concepts as "the unbroken line," "the magic if," and the idea of emotional memory has laid the groundwork for much of the great acting of the 20th century. While much excess and nonsense was to follow in the steps of Stanislavski's writings, his original texts remain invaluable, and surprisingly accessible, to any actor or student of drama. <i>--John Longenbaugh</i>Konstantin Stanislavski (1863-1938) was a Russian director who sought &#39;inner realism&#39; by insisting that his actors find the truth within themselves and &#39;become&#39; the characters they portrayed. His work brought international fame to the Moscow Art Theatre, which he had co-founded with Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko in 1897.

NO WRITING OR HIGHLIGHTING</p><p></p><h2>The Reactionary Mind: Conservatism from Edmund Burke to Sarah Palin</h2><p>Late in life, William F. Buckley made a confession to Corey Robin. Capitalism is "boring," said the founding father of the American right. "Devoting your life to it," as conservatives do, "is horrifying if only because it's so repetitious. It's like sex." With this unlikely conversation began Robin's decade-long foray into the conservative mind. What is conservatism, and what's truly at stake for its proponents? If capitalism bores them, what excites them?<br><br>Tracing conservatism back to its roots in the reaction against the French Revolution, Robin argues that the right is fundamentally inspired by a hostility to emancipating the lower orders. Some conservatives endorse the free market, others oppose it. Some criticize the state, others celebrate it. Underlying these differences is the impulse to defend power and privilege against movements demanding freedom and equality. <br><br>Despite their opposition to these movements, conservatives favor a dynamic conception of politics and society--one that involves self-transformation, violence, and war. They are also highly adaptive to new challenges and circumstances. This partiality to violence and capacity for reinvention has been critical to their success.<br><br>Written by a keen, highly regarded observer of the contemporary political scene, <em>The Reactionary Mind</em> ranges widely, from Edmund Burke to Antonin Scalia, from John C. Calhoun to Ayn Rand. It advances the notion that all rightwing ideologies, from the eighteenth century through today, are historical improvisations on a theme: the felt experience of having power, seeing it threatened, and trying to win it back.<br></p><p><br><strong>Corey Robin</strong> teaches political science at Brooklyn College and the CUNY Graduate Center. His writings have appeared in the <em>New York Times, Harper's,</em> and the <em>London Review of Books.</em><br><br>"<em>The Reactionary Mind</em> has emerged as one of the more influential political works of the last decade." --<em>Washington Monthly</em><p></p><br>"This little book will continue to spark controversy, but that is not the reason to read it: it is a witty, erudite and opinionated account of one of the most significant movements of our times." --Times Higher Education<p></p><br>"Corey Robin's extraordinary collection, constantly fresh, continuously sharp, and always clear and eloquent, provides the only satisfactory philosophically coherent account of elite conservatism I have ever read. Then there's this bonus: his remarkably penetrating side inquiry into the notion of 'national security' as a taproot of America's contemporary abuse of democracy. It's all great, a model in the exercise of humane letters."--Rick Perlstein, author of <em>Nixonland</em><p></p><br>"This book is a fascinating exploration of a central idea: that conservatism is, at its heart, a reaction against democratic challenges, in public and private life, to hierarchies of power and status. Corey Robin leads us through a series of case studies over the last few centuries--from Hobbes to Ayn Rand, from Burke to Sarah Palin--showing the power of this idea by illuminating conservatives both sublime and ridiculous."--Kwame Anthony Appiah, Professor of Philosophy, Princeton University<p></p><br>"Beautifully written, these essays deepen our understanding of why conservatism remains a powerful force in American politics."--Joyce Appleby, Professor Emerita of History, University of California-Los Angeles, and past president of the American Historical Association<p></p><br>"<em>The Reactionary Mind</em> is a wonderfully good read. It combines up-to-the-minute relevance with an eye to the intellectual history of conservatism in all its protean forms, going back as far as Hobbes, and taking in not only restrained and sentimental defenders of tradition such as Burke, but his more violent, proto-fascist contemporary Joseph de Maistre. Some readers will enjoy Corey Robin's dismantling of different recent thinkers--Barry Goldwater, Antonin Scalia, Irving Kristol; others will enjoy his demolition of Ayn Rand's intellectual pretensions. Some will be uncomfortable when they discover that those who too lightly endorse state violence, and even officially sanctioned torture, include some of their friends. That is one of the things that makes this such a good book."--Alan Ryan, Professor of Political Theory, Oxford University<p></p><br>"Robin is an engaging writer, and just the kind of broad-ranging public intellectual all too often missing in academic political science. ...Robin's arguments deserve widespread attention."--<em>The New Republic</em><p></p><br>"This is a very readable romp through the evils of Conservatism."--<em>The Guardian/Observer</em><p></p><br>"...an insightful book ... In a world where the old distinctions between left and right seem to be getting stale, Robin's book concentrates our minds on the deeper divisions."--<em>The Daily</em><p></p><br>"It is a thoughtful, even-tempered sort of book. The old maid tendency that dominates liberal polemic in the U.S.--the shrieking, clutching at skirts, and jumping up on kitchen chairs that one gets from a Joe Nocera, a Maureen Dowd, or a Keith Olbermann--is quite absent. "--<em>The American</em> <em>Conservative</em><p></p><br>"...the common opinion on the Left is that conservatives are fire-breathing idiots, who make up in heat what they lack in light. Robin's book is a welcome correction of this simplistic view and puts the debate where it ought to be: on the force and content of conservative ideas." --<em>Dissent</em> <br><p></p><br></p><h2>Unbound: A Practical Guide to Deliverance (from Evil Spirits)</h2><p>Many Christians find themselves struggling with a particular sin or dysfunction. They seek counseling, practice confession, and pursue God-centered lives, yet still these genuine believers feel hopeless in finding freedom. Could they be under the influence of evil spirits? Yes, says author Neal Lozano. In Unbound, he reveals Satan&#39;s strategies and the sneaky &#34;entrance points&#34; Satan finds to get a toehold in a Christian&#39;s life. He helps readers acknowledge the doors they may have opened to evil influence, and shows them how to close those doors and walk in God&#39;s freedom and abundance. Lozano&#39;s focus on God and his work in the believer&#39;s life, not on intimidating aspects of evil spirits, gives this book a balanced and hopeful tone. Because deliverance is part of the ongoing, glorious work of the Holy Spirit, Unbound outlines a plan for tapping into the potent power of the gospel. It also offers guidance on how pastors, counselors, and laity can pray for others who are still bound by evil and help them to gain victory.</p><p>God has a plan for your life. Don&#39;t let Satan spoil it. Do you find yourself struggling with the same sin area, time after time? Do you feel hopeless in finding freedom, despite your best efforts? Unbound will help you acknowledge and close the doors you may have opened to evil influence and Satan&#39;s underhanded strategies. By tapping into the potent power of the Gospel, you can foil Satan&#39;s plans for your life and live the abundant, glorious life God has in mind. This balanced, hopeful book will guide you to freedom, focusing on God and His work in the believer&#39;s life-not on intimidating aspects of evil spirits. It also includes practical instruction on praying for others to be set free. &#34;One of the best books on deliverance.&#34; Randy Clark, founder, Global Awakening &#34;Unbound is very usable as an introduction to a deliverance ministry.

BUSINESS AND SOCIETY: ETHICS, SUSTAINABILITY, AND STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT, Ninth Edition, demonstrates how the most successful business decision makers balance and protect the interests of various stakeholders, including investors, employees, the community, and the environment--particularly as business recovers from a perilous financial period. The authors effectively balance strong coverage of ethics and the stakeholder model with an increased focus on one of business&#39;s most recent, urgent mandates: sustainability. Coverage highlights the connection between business and the natural, social, and financial environments, illustrating how all three must be maintained in balance to sustain current and future generations. New actual business cases, real applications, and today&#39;s latest business examples present you with specific business challenges that test your values and require you to focus your reasoning skills for ongoing success in today&#39;s workplace.</p><p>Dr. Archie B.

For ten years the original volume has served as a stimulating introduction for general readers and as an indispensable guide for students and scholars. A distinguished international assembly of 249 philosophers contributed almost 2,000 entries, and many of these have now been considerably revised and updated in this major new edition; to these are added over 300 brand-new pieces on a fascinating range of current topics such as animal consciousness, cloning, corporate responsibility, the family, globalization, terrorism .<br><br>Here is, indeed, a world of thought, with entries on idealism and empiricism, epicureanism and stoicism, passion and emotion, deism and pantheism. The contributors represent a veritable who's who of modern philosophy, including such eminent figures as Isaiah Berlin, Sissela Bok, Ronald Dworkin, John Searle, Michael Walzer, and W. V. Quine. We meet the great thinkers--from Aristotle and Plato, to Augustine and Aquinas, to Descartes and Kant, to Nietzsche and Schopenhauer, right up to contemporary thinkers such as Richard Rorty, Jacques Derrida, Luce Iragaray, and Noam Chomsky. There are short entries on key concepts such as personal identity and the mind-body problem, major doctrines from utilitarianism to Marxism, schools of thought such as the Heidelberg School or the Vienna Circle, and contentious public issues such as abortion, capital punishment, and welfare. In addition, the book offers short explanations of philosophical terms (qualia, supervenience, iff), puzzles (the Achilles paradox, the prisoner's dilemma), and curiosities (the philosopher's stone, slime). Almost every entry is accompanied by suggestions for further reading, and the book includes both a chronological chart of the history of philosophy and a gallery of portraits of eighty eminent philosophers.<br><br>An indispensable guide and a constant source of stimulation and enlightenment, <em>The Oxford Companion to Philosophy</em> will appeal to everyone interested in abstract thought, the eternal questions, and the foundations of human understanding.<br></p><p><br><strong>Ted Honderich</strong> is Emeritus Grote Professor of the Philosophy of Mind and Logic at University College London. His major work is A <em>Theory of Determinism: The Mind, Neuroscience, and Life-Hopes</em> and is also known for his writings on political philosophy and for the widely successful philosophy readers which he has edited.<br>"The brave, large aim of this book," boasts editor Honderich, as he did of the 1995 first edition, "has been to bring philosophy together between two covers better than ever before." That is a lofty goal indeed, given such outstanding competition as <i>The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy </i>(1999), <i>Concise Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy</i>(2000), and <i>The Shorter Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy </i>(2005). The latter two are abridgements of the 10-volume <i>Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy </i>(1998). What all have in common are alphabetical arrangement, 2,000 or so articles of varying length by hundreds of experts, and an emphasis on the Western philosophical tradition beginning with the pre-Socratics and culminating in twentieth-century Anglo-American philosophy while still making room for the continental and non-Western philosophical traditions. All have considerable complementary differences in terms of authors and entries. <p>As with the first edition, Honderich has provided a reference work of both great value and pleasurable reading. He has allowed authors to show their idiosyncrasies, perhaps nowhere more so than in his own mind-twisting entry on <i>Unlikely philosophical propositions.</i> Some 300 new entries (including <i>Animal consciousness</i>, <i>Cloning,</i> and <i>Corporate responsibility</i>) have been added. Many others have been revised, lengthened, or updated. The distinguished list of contributors has increased from 249 to 291. Subjects range from paragraph-length entries on philosophers (some of whom are represented in the handful of illustrations) and concepts to entries of several thousand words on 20 or so giants of Western philosophy, aspects of the major branches of philosophy, and various national philosophies. There are entries for some 150 contemporary philosophers. Each entry is followed by a reference list. Adding value are appendixes of logical symbols, maps of philosophy showing hierarchical relationships, and a chronology of philosophy with contemporaneous figures and events in the facing column. The index is composed almost entirely of main-entry headings with lists of entries that are related. </p><p>This volume is highly recommended for academic, public, and high-school library reference collections and for philosophically curious browsers. For libraries looking for a work more uniformly accessible to the uninitiated, <i>Concise Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy</i> is a better choice. <i>Craig Bunch</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

There, eaten up by pride, lust, petty grudges, and paranoid fantasies, he does as little as he possibly can while plotting his eventual transfer to Buenos Aires, where everything about his hopeless existence will, he is confident, be miraculously transformed and made good. <br> &nbsp;<br> Don Diego&#x2019;s slow, nightmarish slide into the abyss is not just a tale of one man&#x2019;s perdition but an exploration of existential, and very American, loneliness. <i>Zama</i>, with its stark dreamlike prose and spare imagery, is at once dense and unforeseen, terse and fateful, marked throughout by a haunting movement between sentences, paragraphs, and sections, so that every word seems to emerge from an ocean of things left unsaid. The philosophical depths of this great book spring directly from its dazzling prose.</p><p><b>Antonio di Benedetto </b>(1922&#x2013;1986) was an Argentine journalist and the author of five novels, of which <i>Zama</i> is the best known. His first book, the story collection <i>Mundo Animal</i> (1952), appeared in English translation in 1997 as <i>Animal World</i>.<br> <b>&nbsp;<br> Esther Allen </b>has translated Javier Mar�as, Jorge Luis Borges, Felisberto Hern�ndez, Flaubert, Rosario Castellanos, Blaise Cendrars, Marie Darrieussecq, and Jos� Mart�. She currently teaches at Baruch College and has directed the work of the PEN Translation Fund since its founding in 2003. Allen has received a Fulbright Grant, two National Endowment for the Arts Translation Fellowships, and was named a Chevalier of the Order of Arts and Letters."<i>Zama</i> remains the most attractive of Di Benedetto's books, if only because of the crazy energy of Zama himself, which is vividly conveyed in Esther Allen's excellent translation." &#x2014;J. M Coetzee, <i>The New York Review of Books</i><br><br>"An ardent fan of Dostoyevsky, Di Benedetto is given to portraying states of extremity&#x2014;of obsession, delusion, wild aggression&#x2014;but without any nineteenth-century rhetorical overheating...<i>Zama</i> has been described as a work of existentialist fiction, and its protagonist, alone with a troubled mind, is as much an ambassador from the twentieth century as a Baroque-era bureaucrat. As with novels by Kafka, Camus, Sartre, and Beckett, the story's preoccupation is the tension between human freedom and constraining circumstance...The belated arrival of <i>Zama</i> in the United States raises an admittedly hyperbolic question: Can it be that the Great American Novel was written by an Argentinean? It's hard, anyway, to think of a superior novel about the bloody life of the frontier." &#x2014;Benjamin Kunkel, <i>The New Yorker</i><br><br>"Available in English for the first time, this 1956 classic of Argentine literature presents a riveting portrait of a mind deteriorating as the 18th century draws to a close....The final images of the novel are haunting and unforgettable.

It&#x2019;s Sartre by way of J. Peterman, and in Esther Allen&#x2019;s translation it still feels unique and alive.&#x201d; &#x2014;Dan Piepenbring, <i>Paris Review Daily</i><br><br>&#x201c;This year's release of Antonio Di Benedetto&#x2019;s masterpiece is a literary event of great importance, and it puts an end to an unjust historical neglect.&#x201d; &#x2014;Daniel Salda�a Par�s,&nbsp;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br> &nbsp;<br>&#x201c;This is a book that I could see myself reading many times, and always profiting from, seeing it each time as if was reading a whole other book...Read it. <i>Zama</i> has been worth waiting 7 years for.&#x201d; &#x2014;Scott Esposito, <i>Conversational Reading</i><br><br> &#x201c;Scattered in various corners of Latin America and Spain, [<i>Zama</i>] had a few, fervent readers, almost all of them friends or unwarranted enemies....

I think that <i>Zama</i> should be translated into English simply because so many English-speaking readers and authors haven&#x2019;t read one of the best novels of the 20th century. Good books are unique and need no justification.&#x201d; &#x2014;Sergio Chejfec, <i>The Quarterly Conversation</i><br><br> &#x201c;Widely regarded as an existential masterpiece and one of the great novels of the Spanish language, <i>Zama</i> is Antonio di Benedetto&#x2019;s most famous&#x2014;and, arguably, his best&#x2014;work. It is, therefore, hard to explain why this novel, first published in 1956, has never been translated into English and, more broadly, why this author&#x2014;who occupies an important place in Argentina&#x2019;s narrative tradition&#x2014;is not more well known in the English-speaking world. All the more so because the historical and stylistic incisiveness of Di Benedetto&#x2019;s writing make <i>Zama</i> a timeless achievement, as readable today as when it first came off the presses half a century ago.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The Latin American Review of Books</i><br>&nbsp; <br> &#x201c;<i>[Zama</i>] is comparable to the great existentialist novels such as <i>La Naus�e</i> and <i>L&#x2019;�tranger</i>, but I believe that, given the circumstances in which it was written and the peculiar situation of the person who wrote it, <i>Zama</i> is in many ways superior to those books.&#x201d; &#x2014;Juan Jos� Saer<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The structure of <i>Zama</i> is as precise as it is disturbing. Its three chapters, with ellipses of several years between them, contain episodes like entries in an intimate diary that alternate with assaults on consciousness that can neither remain silent nor lie. Thus are readers led ever further into the depths, in an irreparable descent into hell.... The book&#x2019;s shatteringly audacious conclusion forces us to revise our view of all that has gone before. <i>Zama </i>teaches us to read in a new way, astonishes us with the discovery that we know nothing.&#x201d; &#x2014;Raul Cazorla, <i>El Varapalo<br></i><br><i>Zama</i>, a classic of Argentine literature that has finally made its way into English (thanks to the years-long work of Esther Allen), is an existentialist-of-sorts masterpiece.<br>&#x2014;Lucas Iberico Lozada,&nbsp;<i>Paste</i></p><h2>Amsco Advanced Placement Psychology Amsco Advanced Placement Psychology Amsco Advanced Placement Psychology</h2><p>Equip your students to excel in the current AP Psychology course and on the exam.</p><p></p><h2>The Collected Stories Of Eudora Welty</h2><p><b>With a new introduction from best-selling author Ann Patchett, the National Book Award&#x2013;winning story collection that is one of the great works of twentieth-century American literature&nbsp; </b><br><br> Eudora Welty wrote novels, novellas, and reviews over the course of her long career, but the heart and soul of her literary vision lay with the short story, and her National Book Award&#x2013;winning <i>Collected Stories</i>, written when it was first published, confirmed her as a master of short fiction.

It was with the publication of <i>The Fountainhead</i> (1943) and <i>Atlas Shrugged</i> (1957) that she achieved her spectacular success. Rand&#x2019;s unique philosophy, Objectivism, has gained a worldwide audience. The fundamentals of her philosophy are put forth in three nonfiction books, <i>Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology</i>, <i>The Virtues of Selfishness</i>, and <i>Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal</i>. They are all available in Signet editions, as is the magnificent statement of her artistic credo, <i>The Romantic Manifesto</i>.<b>INTRODUCTION</b><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ayn Rand held that art is a &#x201c;re-creation of reality according to an artist&#x2019;s metaphysical value judgments.&#x201d; By its nature, therefore, a novel (like a statue or a symphony) does not require or tolerate an explanatory preface; it is a self-contained universe, aloof from commentary, beckoning the reader to enter, perceive, respond.</p><p>Ayn Rand would never have approved of a didactic (or laudatory) introduction to her book, and I have no intention of flouting her wishes. Instead, I am going to give her the floor. I am going to let you in on some of the thinking she did as she was preparing to write &nbsp;<i>Atlas Shrugged.</i></p><p>Before starting a novel, Ayn Rand wrote voluminously in her journals about its theme, plot, and characters. She wrote not for any audience, but strictly for herself&#x2014;that is, for the clarity of her own understanding. The journals dealing with&nbsp;<i>Atlas Shrugged</i>&nbsp;are powerful examples of her mind in action, confident even when groping, purposeful even when stymied, luminously eloquent even though wholly unedited. These journals are also a fascinating record of the step-by-step birth of an immortal work of art.</p><p>In due course, all of Ayn Rand&#x2019;s writings will be published. For this 35th anniversary edition of&nbsp;<i>Atlas Shrugged,</i>however, I have selected, as a kind of advance bonus for her fans, four typical journal entries. Let me warn new readers that the passages reveal the plot and will spoil the book for anyone who reads them before knowing the story.</p><p>As I recall, &#x201c;Atlas Shrugged&#x201d; did not become the novel&#x2019;s title until Miss Rand&#x2019;s husband made the suggestion in 1956. The working title throughout the writing was &#x201c;The Strike.&#x201d;</p><p>The earliest of Miss Rand&#x2019;s notes for &#x201c;The Strike&#x201d; are dated January 1, 1945, about a year after the publication of<i>The Fountainhead.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally enough, the subject on her mind was how to differentiate the present novel from its predecessor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Theme</i>. What happens to the world when the Prime Movers go on strike.</p><p>This means&#x2014;a picture of the world with its motor cut off. Show: what, how, why. The specific steps and incidents&#x2014;in terms of persons, their spirits, motives, psychology and actions&#x2014;and, &nbsp;secondarily, proceeding from persons, in terms of history, society and the world.</p><p>The theme requires: to show who are the prime movers and why, how they function. Who are their enemies and why, what are the motives behind the hatred for and the enslavement of the prime movers; the nature of the obstacles placed in their way, and the reasons for it.</p><p>This last paragraph is contained entirely in&nbsp;<i>The Fountainhead.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Roark and Toohey are the complete statement of it. Therefore, this is not the direct theme of&nbsp;<i>The Strike</i>&#x2014;but it is part of the theme and must be kept in mind, stated again (though briefly) to have the theme clear and complete.</p><p>First question to decide is on whom the emphasis must be placed&#x2014;on the prime movers, the parasites or the world. The answer is:&nbsp;<i>The world.</i>&nbsp;The story must be primarily a picture of the whole.</p><p>In this sense,&nbsp;<i>The Strike</i>&nbsp;is to be much more a &#x201c;social&#x201d; novel than&nbsp;<i>The Fountainhead. The Fountainhead</i>&nbsp;was about &#x201c;individualism and collectivism within man&#x2019;s soul&#x201d;; it showed the nature and function of the creator and the second-hander. The primary concern there was with Roark and Toohey&#x2014;showing &nbsp;<i>what they are</i>. The rest of the characters were variations of the theme of the relation of the ego to others&#x2014;mixtures of the two extremes, the two poles: Roark and Toohey. The primary concern of the story was the characters, the people as such&#x2014;their&nbsp;<i>natures</i>. Their relations to each other&#x2014;which is society, men in relation to men&#x2014;were secondary, an unavoidable, direct consequence of Roark set against Toohey. But it was not the theme.</p><p>Now, it is this&nbsp;<i>relation</i>&nbsp;that must be the theme. Therefore, the personal becomes secondary. That is, the personal is necessary only to the extent needed to make the relationships clear. In&nbsp;<i>The Fountainhead</i>&nbsp;I showed that Roark moves the world&#x2014;that the Keatings feed upon him and hate him for it, while the Tooheys are out consciously to destroy him. But the theme was Roark&#x2014;not Roark&#x2019;s relation to the world. Now it will be the relation.</p><p>In other words, I must show in what concrete, specific way the world is moved by the creators. Exactly&nbsp;<i>how</i>&nbsp;do the second-handers live on the creators. Both in&nbsp;<i>spiritual</i>&nbsp;matters&#x2014;and (most particularly) in concrete, physical events. (Concentrate on the concrete, physical events&#x2014;but don&#x2019;t forget to keep in mind at all times how the physical proceeds from the spiritual.) . . .</p><p>However, for the purpose of this story, I do not start by showing&nbsp;<i>how</i>&nbsp;the second-handers live on the prime movers in actual, everyday reality&#x2014;nor do I start by showing a normal world. (That comes in only in necessary retrospect, or flashback, or by implication in the events themselves.) I start with &nbsp;<i>the fantastic premise of the prime movers going on strike.</i>&nbsp;This is the actual heart and center of the novel. A distinction carefully &nbsp;to be observed here: I do not set out to glorify the prime mover (<i>that was The Fountainhead</i>). I set out to show how desperately the world needs prime movers, and how viciously it treats them. And I show it on a hypothetical case&#x2014;<i>what happens to the world without them.</i></p><p>In&nbsp;<i>The Fountainhead</i>&nbsp;I did not show how desperately the world needed Roark&#x2014;except by implication. I did show how viciously the world treated him, and why. I showed&nbsp;<i>mainly what he is.</i>&nbsp;It was Roark&#x2019;s story. This must be the world&#x2019;s story&#x2014;in relation to its prime movers. (Almost&#x2014;the story of a body in relation to its heart&#x2014;a body dying of anemia.)</p><p>I don&#x2019;t show directly what the prime movers do&#x2014;that&#x2019;s shown only by implication. I&nbsp;<i>show what happens when they don&#x2019;t do it.</i>&nbsp;(Through that, you see the picture of what they do, their place and their role.) (This is an important guide for the construction of the story.)</p><p>In order to work out the story, Ayn Rand had to understand fully why the prime movers&nbsp;<i>allowed</i>&nbsp;the second-handers to live on them&#x2014;why the creators had not gone on strike throughout history&#x2014;what errors even the best of them made that kept them in thrall to the worst. Part of the answer is dramatized in the character of Dagny Taggart, the railroad heiress who declares war on the strikers. Here is a note on her psychology, dated April 18, 1946:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Her error&#x2014;and the cause of her refusal to join the strike&#x2014;is over-optimism and over-confidence (particularly this last). Over-optimism&#x2014;in that she thinks men are better than they are, she doesn&#x2019;t really understand them and is generous about it.</p><p>Over-confidence&#x2014;in that she thinks she can do more than an individual actually can. She thinks she can run a railroad (or the world) single-handed, she can make people do what she wants or needs, what is right, by the sheer force of her own talent; not by&nbsp;<i>forcing</i>&nbsp;them, of course, not by enslaving them and giving orders&#x2014;but by the sheer over-abundance of her own energy; she will show them how, she can teach them and persuade them, she is so able that they&#x2019;ll catch it from her. (This is still faith in their rationality, in the omnipotence of reason. The mistake? Reason is not automatic. Those who deny it cannot be conquered by it. Do not count on them. Leave them alone.)</p><p>On these two points, Dagny is committing an important (but excusable and understandable) error in thinking, the kind of error individualists and creators often make. It is an error proceeding from the best in their nature and from a proper principle, but this principle is misapplied. . . .</p><p>The error is this: it is proper for a creator to be optimistic, in the deepest, most basic sense, since the creator believes in a benevolent universe and functions on that premise. But it is an error to extend that optimism to other&nbsp;<i>specific</i>men. First, &nbsp;it&#x2019;s not necessary, the creator&#x2019;s life and the nature of the universe do not require it, his life does not depend on others. Second, man is a being with free will; therefore, each man is potentially good or evil, and it&#x2019;s up to him and only to him (through his reasoning mind) to decide which he wants to be. The decision will affect only him; it is not (and cannot and should not be) the primary concern of any other human being.</p><p>Therefore, while a creator does and must worship&nbsp;<i>Man</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;(which means his own highest potentiality; which is his natural self-reverence), he must not make the mistake of thinking that this means the necessity to worship&nbsp;<i>Mankind</i>(as a collective). These are two entirely different conceptions, with entirely&#x2014;(immensely and diametrically opposed)&#x2014;different consequences.</p><p>Man, at his highest potentiality, is realized and fulfilled within each creator himself. . . .Whether the creator is alone, or finds only a handful of others like him, or is among the majority of mankind, is of no importance or consequence whatever; numbers have nothing to do with it. He alone or he and a few others like him&nbsp;<i>are</i>&nbsp;mankind, in the proper sense of being the proof of what man actually is, man at his best, the essential man, man at his highest possibility. (The&nbsp;<i>rational</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;being, who acts according to his nature.)</p><p>It should not matter to a creator whether anyone or a million or&nbsp;<i>all</i>&nbsp;the men around him fall short of the ideal of Man; let him live up to that ideal himself; this is all the &#x201c;optimism&#x201d; about Man that he needs. But this is a hard and subtle thing to realize&#x2014;and it would be natural for Dagny always to make the mistake of believing others are better than they really are (or will become better, or she will teach them to become better or, actually, she so desperately&nbsp;<i>wants</i>them to be better)&#x2014;and to be tied to the world by that hope.</p><p>It is proper for a creator to have an unlimited confidence in himself and his ability, to feel certain that he can get anything he wishes out of life, that he can accomplish anything he decides to accomplish, and that it&#x2019;s up to him to do it. (He feels it because he is a man of reason . . .) [But] here is what he must keep clearly in mind: it is true that a creator can accomplish anything he wishes&#x2014;if he functions according to the nature of man, the universe and his own proper morality, that is, if he does not place his wish primarily within others and does not attempt or desire anything that is of a collective nature, anything that concerns others&nbsp;<i>primarily</i>&nbsp;or requires primarily the exercise of the will of others. (This would be an &nbsp;<i>immoral</i>&nbsp;desire or attempt, contrary to his nature as a creator.) If he attempts that, he is out of a creator&#x2019;s province and in that of the collectivist and the second-hander.</p><p>Therefore, he must never feel confident that he can do anything whatever to, by or through others. (He can&#x2019;t&#x2014;and he shouldn&#x2019;t even wish to try it&#x2014;and the mere attempt is improper.) He must not think that he can . . . somehow transfer his energy and his intelligence to them and make them fit for &nbsp;his purposes in that way. He must face other men as they are, recognizing them as essentially independent entities, by nature, and beyond his&nbsp;<i>primary</i>&nbsp;influence; [he must] deal with them only on his own, independent terms, deal with such as he judges can fit his purpose or live up to his standards (by themselves and of their own will, independently of him) and expect nothing from the others. . . .</p><p>Now, in Dagny&#x2019;s case, her desperate desire is to run Taggart Transcontinental. She sees that there are no men suited to her purpose around her, no men of ability, independence and competence. She thinks she can run it with others, with the incompetent and the parasites, either by training them or merely by treating them as robots who will take her orders and function without personal initiative or responsibility;&nbsp;<i>with herself, in effect, being the spark of initiative, the bearer of responsibility for a whole collective.</i>&nbsp;This can&#x2019;t be done. This is her crucial error.</p><p>This is where she fails.</p><p>Ayn Rand&#x2019;s basic purpose as a novelist was to present not villains or even heroes with errors, but the ideal man&#x2014;the consistent, the fully integrated, the perfect. In&nbsp;<i>Atlas Shrugged,</i>&nbsp;this is John Galt, the towering figure who moves the world and the novel, yet does not appear onstage until Part III. By his nature (and that of the story) Galt is necessarily central to the lives of all the characters. In one note, &#x201c;Galt&#x2019;s relation to the others,&#x201d; dated June 27, 1946, Miss Rand defines succinctly what Galt represents to each of them:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>For Dagny</i>&#x2014;the ideal. The answer to her two quests: the man of genius and the man she loves. The first quest is expressed in her search for the inventor of the engine. The second&#x2014;her growing conviction that she will never be in love . . .</p><p><i>For Rearden</i>&#x2014;the friend. The kind of understanding and appreciation he has always wanted and did not know he wanted (or he thought he had it&#x2014;he tried to find it in those around him, to get it from his wife, his mother, brother and sister).</p><p><i>For Francisco d&#x2019;Anconia</i>&#x2014;the aristocrat. The only man who represents a challenge and a stimulant&#x2014;almost the &#x201c;proper kind&#x201d; of audience, worthy of stunning for the sheer joy and color of life.</p><p><i>For Danneskj�ld</i>&#x2014;the anchor. The only man who represents land and roots to a restless, reckless wanderer, like the goal of a struggle, the port at the end of a fierce sea-voyage&#x2014;the only man he can respect.</p><p><i>For the Composer</i>&#x2014;the inspiration and the perfect audience.</p><p><i>For the Philosopher</i>&#x2014;the embodiment of his abstractions.</p><p><i>For Father Amadeus</i>&#x2014;the source of his conflict. The uneasy realization that Galt is the end&nbsp;<i>of</i>&nbsp;his endeavors, the man of virtue, the perfect man&#x2014;and that his means do not fit this end (and that he is destroying this, his ideal, for the sake of those who are evil).</p><p><i>To James Taggart</i>&#x2014;the eternal threat. The secret dread. The reproach. The guilt (his own guilt). He has no specific tie-in with Galt&#x2014;but he has that constant, causeless, unnamed, hysterical fear. And he recognizes it when he hears Galt&#x2019;s broadcast and when he sees Galt in person for the first time.</p><p><i>To the Professor</i>&#x2014;his conscience. The reproach and reminder. The ghost that haunts him through everything he does, without a moment&#x2019;s peace. The thing that says:&nbsp;<i>&#x201c;No&#x201d;</i>&nbsp;to his whole life.</p><p>Some notes on the above: Rearden&#x2019;s sister, Stacy, was a minor character later cut from the novel.</p><p>&#x201c;Francisco&#x201d; was spelled &#x201c;Francesco&#x201d; in these early years, while Danneskj�ld&#x2019;s first name at this point was Ivar, presumably after Ivar Kreuger, the Swedish &#x201c;match king,&#x201d; who was the real-life model of Bjorn Faulkner in&nbsp;<i>Night of January 16th.</i></p><p>Father Amadeus was Taggart&#x2019;s priest, to whom he confessed his sins. The priest was supposed to be a positive character, honestly devoted to the good but practicing consistently the morality of mercy. Miss Rand dropped him, she told me, when she found that it was impossible to make such a character convincing.</p><p>The Professor is Robert Stadler.</p></p><h2>The Iron Heel (Rediscovered Classics)</h2><p>Written in 1908, this visionary novel about class struggle anticipates the political upheavals of the 1930s and beyond.</p><p>This book is in Electronic Paperback Format.

This book is the deeply moving story of his life &#x2014; as a slave, and as a free man.<br>Douglass wrote three autobiographies, of which the 1855 edition is the most detailed on his life as a slave. In it, readers are not spared the fullest and most graphic descriptions of the cruelty of slavery. Douglass describes his life on a Maryland plantation: the excitement and danger of teaching himself to read and write, his demoralization under a cruel master, and his daring escape.<br>In the second part of his tale, Douglass, now a fugitive, settles in Massachusetts and joins the anti-slavery movement. He recounts his travels to the British Isles and his first taste of freedom without prejudice, and his return to America to work as spokesman for his oppressed people. In addition to recording his sufferings and his protests, Douglass also provides a keen analysis of the effects of slavery on its victims as well as on society at large.</p><p>This book is in Electronic Paperback Format.

Populated with artists and summer tourists, Ephraim has just enough going on to satisfy her city tastes. But she is fascinated and repelled by the furthest tip of Door County peninsula, Washington Island, utterly removed from the hubbub of modern life. Fiona's visits there leave her refreshed in spirit, but convinced that only lunatics and hermits could survive a winter in its frigid isolation.&nbsp;&nbsp; In a moment of weakness, Fiona is goaded into accepting a dare that she cannot survive the winter on the island in a decrepit, old house.&nbsp;Armed with some very fine single malt scotch and a copy of <i>Meditations&nbsp;</i>by Marcus Aurelius, Fiona sets out to win the dare, and discovers that small town life is not nearly as dull as she had foreseen. Abandoning the things she has always thought important, she encounters the vicious politics of small town life, a ruthless neighbor, persistent animals, a haunted ferry captain, and the peculiar spiritual renewal of life north of the tension line.</p><p><p>J.F.

By means of guided walks and talks, tours, exhibits, and signs, visitors experience these areas through a very special kind of communication technique known as "interpretation." For fifty years, Freeman Tilden's <i>Interpreting Our Heritage</i> has been an indispensable sourcebook for those who are responsible for developing and delivering interpretive programs. This expanded and revised anniversary edition includes not only Tilden's classic work but also an entirely new selection of accompanying photographs, five additional essays by Tilden on the art and craft of interpretation, a new foreword by former National Park Service director Russell Dickenson, and an introduction by R. Bruce Craig that puts Tilden's writings into perspective for present and future generations. <br><br>Whether the challenge is to make a prehistoric site come to life; to explain the geological basis behind a particular rock formation; to touch the hearts and minds of visitors to battlefields, historic homes, and sites; or to teach a child about the wonders of the natural world, Tilden's book, with its explanation of the famed "six principles" of interpretation, provides a guiding hand. <br><br>For anyone interested in our natural and historic heritage--park volunteers and rangers, museum docents and educators, new and seasoned professional heritage interpreters, and those lovingly characterized by Tilden as "happy amateurs--<i>Interpreting Our Heritage</i> and Tilden's later interpretive writings, included in this edition, collectively provide the essential foundation for bringing into focus the truths that lie beyond what the eye sees.<br><br></p><p>"[A] seminal book which may inspire yet another generation of park rangers."-- <i>Reflections</i> <br>Freeman Tilden (1883-1980) was a pioneer in the field of natural and cultural interpretation.

The highest wisdom, then, is to know where you are going." Yet many today chase the false rabbits of success: status, luxury, reputation and material possessions. In the quest to "have it all," our lives often lack real meaning and purpose. <em>Beyond Wealth</em> is the antidote. <p><em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Alexander Green takes things right down to brass tacks: We are here for a short time. Knowledge is limitless. Therefore, the most critical knowledge is not any particular skill but rather wisdom about "how to live." Fortunately, men and women have had several thousand years to think about what it means to live "the good life." And the answers found here, from Plato and Aristotle to Mahatma Gandhi and Stephen Hawking, will both surprise and delight you.</p> <p><em>Beyond Wealth</em> provides insightful commentary on the most important aspects of our lives: love, work, honor, trust, freedom, death, fear, truth, beauty and other timeless issues. The book is both a thought provoking read and the ideal gift, guaranteed to ennoble, uplift and inspire.</p></p><p><p><b>beyond WEALTH</b> </p><p><b>What does it mean to be truly wealthy?</b> </p><p>As a longtime financial writer and nationally acclaimed investment advisor, Alexander Green understands the importance of money. But in this insightful and inspiring new book, he looks beyond traditional measures of wealth to explore how a rich life is one of significance, not just financial success. </p><p>As Green observes, money creates wealth, but so do character, conscience, attitude, and wisdom. Only by incorporating each of these elements into your day-to-day existence can you experience what the ancients called "the good life." </p><p>A generous, wide-ranging inquiry into what matters most, <i>Beyond Wealth</i> is a road map to a rich life, to what the author calls "True Wealth." </p><p>The book contains more than sixty-five commentaries on topics ranging from love, health, leisure, honor, courage, trust, philosophy, history, science, and spirituality. And the author's perspective on each subject is broadened and deepened by liberal quotations from Shakespeare, Thoreau, Emerson, Gandhi, Einstein, Tolstoy, and other great minds. </p><p><i>Beyond Wealth</i> is full of practical wisdom. Yet it is also a book of contemplations, promoting both greater understanding and deep reflection. Each piece can be read alone and is characterized by brevity, wit, and a liveliness of mind that recalls the best of Montaigne and Swift. </p><p>Combining personal anecdotes with provocative insights and timeless truths, <i>Beyond Wealth</i> is a fascinating exploration of the unique intersection between money, personal fulfillment, and successful living.</p><p><b>ALEXANDER GREEN</b> is the Investment Director of The Oxford Club and the author of two national bestsellers: <i>The Gone Fishin' Portfolio</i> and <i>The Secret of Shelter Island: Money and What Matters</i>.

Keiji Nishitani notes the irreversible trend of Western civilization to nihilism, and singles out the conquest of nihilism as <i>the</i> task for contemporary philosophy. Nihility, or relative nothingness, can only be overcome by being radicalized to Emptiness, or absolute nothingness. Taking absolute nothingness as the fundamental notion in rational explanations of the Eastern experience of human life, Professor Nishitani examines the relevance of this notion for contemporary life, and in particular for Western philosophical theories and religious believes. Everywhere his basic intention remains the same: to direct our modern predicament to a resolution through this insight.<br><br>The challenge that the thought of Keiji Nishitani presents to the West, as a modern version of an Eastern speculative tradition that is every bit as old and as variegated as our own, is one that brings into unity the principle of reality and the principle of salvation. In the process, one traditional Western idea after another comes under scrutiny: the dichotomy of faith and reason, of being and substance, the personal and transcendent notions of God, the exaggerated role given to the knowing ego, and even the Judeo-Christian view of history itself.<br><br><i>Religion and Nothingness</i> represents the major work of one of Japan's most powerful and committed philosophical minds.</p><p>Text: English, Japanese (translation)</p><h2>The Foundation Trilogy (Adapted by BBC Radio) This book is a transcription of the radio broadcast</h2><p><strong>NOTE: THIS IS NOT THE ACTUAL BOOK.

Clarke), is best known for his Robot, Galactic Empire, and Foundation series.<br><br>Michael Dirda is a Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning critic for <i>The Washington Post </i>and the author of the memoir <i>An Open Book </i>and of four collections of essays: <i>Readings, Bound to Please, Book by Book, </i>and <i>Classics for Pleasure.<br></i>From the Introduction by Michael Dirda<br><br>It is late summer, 1941. A young Jewish intellectual, an admirer of Gibbon's <i>Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</i>, suddenly finds himself musing about historical determinism, individual initiative and the ideal society. Why did Rome fall? Was the Christian religion a means of preserving ancient culture? What forms of government and economic system are best for mankind? Democratic representation with capitalistic competition? Enlightened despotism? A meritocracy of the best and the brightest?<br><br>Having come of age in 1930s' New York, the young intellectual would have heard fervent Trotskyites on street corners proclaim that history advances through class struggle and through the conflict between evolving political and economic ideologies. He already knew that Arnold Toynbee, in <i>A Study of History</i>, contended that civilizations have their seasons &#x2014; they rise, grow stagnant without sufficient challenges, eventually decay and fall. Still other thinkers, among them H.G. Wells, were convinced that the world should be governed by scientists, with rational benevolence. Wasn't that the theme of the recent movie, <i>Things to Come</i> (1936), with its vision of a perfectly ordered, chrome-bright "world of tomorrow"?<br><br>Still, all these systems and theories made historical change seem a cut-and-dried affair, quite logical, utterly inevitable. Yet where was the individual in these grand schemes of Marx and Toynbee and Wells? If only impersonal forces determined the course of events, how did one account for a Hitler?&nbsp; An upstart from nowhere, he had manipulated the German people with a mesmerist's power, promulgated a manifest destiny for his chosen elite, declared a Thousand-Year Reich. Clearly, the so-called F�hrer viewed himself as a Great Man, able to reshape his time as did Alexander and Napoleon before him. Such overreachers truly make history, don't they?<br><br>So Isaac Asimov, a twenty-one-year-old Columbia graduate, must have thought and wondered when he sat down at his typewriter that summer of 1941. However, what the young writer eventually produced was neither a turgid sociological tract nor a summa of world history. Instead, through a series of stories, Asimov tracked the breakdown of a smug conspicuously rich and stultified civilization, while also portraying the efforts of a highly committed group of activists to hasten the birth of a new and more glorious future society. In effect, he took the central myth of the 1930s and '40s &#x2014; lived out and believed in by Communists, Fascists, the International Brigade and New Deal Democrats alike &#x2014; and re-imagined it, with spaceships, in a galaxy far, far away. Science fiction is, after all, the art of extrapolation.<br><br>By the time Asimov brought his much loved series to a halt in 1949, he had written eight stories and novellas depicting the collapse of a Galactic Empire, the war-torn feudal period that followed, and the mysterious Foundation established to preserve civilization in a time of barbarism. Gathered together into book form &#x2014; what SF fans call a "fix-up" &#x2014; the stories required three volumes: <i>Foundation </i>(1951), <i>Foundation and Empire</i> (1952) and&nbsp; <i>Second Foundation </i>(1953). At the 1955 World Science Fiction Convention this trilogy was enthusiastically voted "the greatest all-time science-fiction series." Period. In the view of many, the assembled sequence also represents a watershed in literary history. A noted SF editor Donald Wollheim quickly realized: "Stores published before <i>Foundation</i> belong to the old line, the stories published after belong to 'modern' science fiction."<br><br>*<br><br>Isaac Asimov (1920-92) grew up in Brooklyn, the son of Russian Jewish immigrants. Something of a whiz kid, he graduated early from high school and attended Columbia University, first as an undergraduate and later as a biochemistry graduate student. After earning his Ph. D., he taught for many years at Boston University before giving up the academic life in 1958 to become a full-time writer.<br><br>As a teenager, Asimov had been a devoted reader of the pulp magazines at his father's candy store: <i>Wonder Stories</i>, <i>Amazing Stories</i>, <i>Astounding Science Fiction</i>. In their pages one could follow the galactic adventures of E. E. "Doc" Smith's "Skylark of Space," shudder at "The Human Pets of Mars" and fight alongside "Tumithak of the Corridors." Before long, the teenaged Asimov begun to crank out his own short stories; the first to be published "Marooned on Vest," appearing in <i>Amazing</i> in 1939. After many rejections, he shortly thereafter broke into <i>Astounding</i> &#x2014; the premier magazine in the field &#x2014; with "Trends" (originally titled, with a&nbsp; kind of clairvoyance, "Ad Astra" &#x2014; i.e., "to the stars"). That "yarn" appeared in the same July 1939 issue as A. E. van Vogt's first story ("Black Destroyer," almost certainly a partial inspiration for the film <i>Alien</i>) and only a month before Robert A. Heinlein's first story, "Lifeline." thus began the Golden Age of Science Fiction, which would last until roughly 1950.<br><br>Asimov developed quickly as a writer. He sold "Robbie," his first robot story, to <i>Super Science Stories</i> in 1940 (where its title was changed to "Strange Playfellow"), and his later ones to <i>Astounding</i>. Asimov always claimed it was John. W. Campbell, Jr., that magazine's legendary editor, who devised the central "Three Laws of Robotics" during a conversation at the end of 1940:<br><br>1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.<br>2. A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.<br>3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.<br><br>By 1941, Asimov was ready for what would prove his <i>annus mirabilis</i>. On March 17, when this still very young writer was visiting the <i>Astounding</i> offices, Campbell unexpectedly quoted a passage from Emerson: "If the stars should appear one night in a thousand years, how would men believe and adore; and preserve for many generations the remembrance of the city of God . . ." What, the magazine editor wondered, would happen to people who suddenly saw stars for the first time? Asimov said he didn't know. Campbell answered: "I think they would go mad. I want you to write a story about that."<br><br>According to the first volume of his autobiography, <i>In Memory Yet Green</i>, Asimov began the story on March 18, 1941 and finished it on April 8. "Nightfall," as he called it, was then published as the cover story for the September issue of <i>Astounding</i> &#x2014; along with the conclusion of Robert Heinlein's short novel <i>Methuselah's Children</i> and in the company of Alfred Bester's now classic "Adam and No Eve." Since that day, "Nightfall" has been judged, over and over again, to be the greatest science-fiction story ever written. Happily neither Heinlein nor Bester would ever complain about this, since the former quickly established himself as the best science-fiction writer of all time and the latter's 1956 novel, <i>The Stars My Destination</i>, is widely and rightly, viewed as the best single SF novel ever written.<br><br>Having formulated the Laws of Robotics and then written "Nightfall," one might assume that young Asimov would devote the rest of his time to his studies. Hardly. That fall <i>Astounding</i> also brought out the first two Foundation stories. Years later, Asimov recalled the genesis of the series:<br><br><i>On August 1, 1941, I took the subway to Campbell's office after class was over. On the way down I racked my brain for a story idea. Failing, I tried a device I sometimes used. I opened a book at random and then tried free association, beginning with whatever I first saw. <br><br>The book I had with me was a collection of Gilbert and Sullivan plays. I opened it to </i>Iolanthe <i>&#x2014; to the picture of the Fairy Queen throwing herself at the feet of Private Willis, the sentry. Thinking of sentries, I thought of soldiers, of military empires, of the Roman Empire &#x2014; of the Galactic Empire &#x2014; aha! . . ."<br><br>Why should I not write of the fall of the Galactic Empire and the return of feudalism, written from the viewpoint of someone in the secure days of the Second Galactic Empire? I thought I knew how to do it for I had read Edward Gibbon's </i>Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire<i> from first page to last at least twice, and I had only to make use of that.<br><br>I was bubbling over by the time I got to Campbell's, and my enthusiasm was catching. It was perhaps too catching for Campbell blazed up as I had never seen him do. <br><br>"That's too large a theme for a short story," he said.<br><br>"I was thinking of a novelette," I said, quickly, adjusting my thoughts.<br><br>"Or a novelette. It will have to be an open-ended series of short stories."<br><br>"What?" I said, weakly.<br><br>"Short stories, novelettes, serials, all fitting into a particular future history, involving the fall of the First Galactic Empire, the period of feudalism that follows and the rise of the Second Galactic Empire.<br><br>"What?" I said, even more weakly. <br><br>"Yes, I want you to write an outline for the future history. Go home and write an outline."<br><br>There Campbell had made a mistake. Robert Heinlein was writing what he called the "Future History Series." He was writing various stories that fitted into one niche or another of the series, and he wasn't writing them in order. Therefore he had prepared a Future History outline that was very detailed and complicated, so that he would keep everything straight. Now Campbell wanted me to do the same.<br><br>Heinlein, however, was Heinlein &#x2014;and Asimov was not Heinlein.<br><br>I went home dutifully, and began preparing an outline that got longer and longer and stupider and stupider until I finally tore it up. It was quite plain that I couldn't work with an outline. (To this day I cannot &#x2014; for any of my stories, articles, or books, whether fiction or nonfiction.)<br><br>On August 11, therefore, I started the story I had originally intended to write (with modifications that resulted from my discussions with Campbell), and the heck with possible future stories. I'd worry about them when the time came &#x2014; and </i>if<i> the time came.<br><br>Since the First Galactic Empire was breaking down (in my story), certain scientists had set up a Foundation on a world at the rim of the Galaxy, purportedly to prepare a vast encyclopedia of human knowledge, but actually to cut down the period of feudalism and hasten the rise of the Second Empire. I called the story &#x2014; drum roll, please &#x2014; "Foundation." <br><br></i>Later in his autobiography, Asimov notes that he submitted "Foundation" on September 8 and on September 17 received a check for $126. From the on, Foundation stories appeared periodically, if irregularly, until the end of the 1940s. When they were collected, Asimov added one more to form a new introduction, and also changed most of the titles.</p><h2>The New Catholic Answer Bible: The New American Bible</h2><p>The New Catholic Answer Bible now has 88 answers to questions about Catholic beliefs and practices and their foundation in Scripture.

Becoming an externally focused church is not about becoming the best church<i> in</i> the community. The externally focused church asks, "How can we be the best church <i>for</i> our community?" That one little preposition changes everything. And that is the big question this new book from the authors of <i>The Externally Focused Church</i> seeks to answer. </p><p>In <i>The Externally Focused Quest</i>, Eric Swanson and Rick Rusaw show church leaders how to transform their churches from being internally focused to being more oriented to the community around them. They use nine big missional concepts that need to be addressed in the quest to become the best church for the community: focus, purpose, scope, missions, partnering, evangelism, systems, creativity, and outcomes. Understanding and applying the truths of each concept will provide many of the tools leaders need to take their churches on the externally focused quest. Written by the cofounders of the Externally Focused Network, this book presents a highly practical approach that gives step-by-step guidance for churches to become truly externally focused without giving up the programs that serve their members.</p></p><h2>Our Mutual Friend</h2><p>Charles Dickens&#39;s last completed novel tells the story of a young man who must marry a stranger in order to win his inheritance. Wanting to learn the lady&#39;s nature, John Harmon fakes his own death and takes on a new identity. As the complexities of the deceit are revealed, Dickens gives us his most profoundly cynical, yet brilliantly funny, insight into the corruption of wealth on human nature. 40 illustrations.</p><p><i>Our Mutual Friend</i> was the last novel Charles Dickens completed and is, arguably, his darkest and most complex. The basic plot is vintage Dickens: an inheritance up for grabs, a murder, a rocky romance or two, plenty of skullduggery, and a host of unforgettable secondary characters. But in this final outing the author's heroes are more flawed, his villains more sympathetic, and the story as a whole more harrowing and less sentimental. The mood is set in the opening scene in which a riverman, Gaffer Hexam, and his daughter Lizzie troll the Thames searching for drowned men whose pockets Gaffer will rifle before turning the body over to the authorities. On this particular night Gaffer finds a corpse that is later identified as that of John Harmon, who was returning from abroad to claim a large fortune when he was apparently murdered and thrown into the river. <p> Harmon's death is the catalyst for everything else that happens in the novel. It seems the fortune was left to the young man on the condition that he marry a girl he'd never met, Bella Wilfer. His death, however, brings a new heir onto the scene, Nicodemus Boffin, the kind-hearted but low-born assistant to Harmon's father. Boffin and his wife adopt young Bella, who is determined to marry money, and also hire a mysterious young secretary, John Rokesmith, who takes an uncommon interest in their ward. Not content with just one plot, Dickens throws in a secondary love story featuring the riverman's daughter, Lizzie Hexam; a dissolute young upper-class lawyer, Eugene Wrayburn; and his rival, the headmaster Bradley Headstone. Dark as the novel is, Dickens is careful to leaven it with secondary characters who are as funny as they are menacing--blackmailing Silas Wegg and his accomplice Mr. Venus, the avaricious Lammles, and self-centered Charlie Hexam. <i>Our Mutual Friend</i> is one of Dickens's most satisfying novels, and a fitting denouement to his prolific career. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>A satiric masterpiece about the allure and peril of money, &#34;Our Mutual Friend revolves around the inheritance of a dust-heap where the rich throw their trash. When the body of John Harmon, the dust-heap&#39;s expected heir, is found in the Thames, fortunes change hands surprisingly, raising to new heights &#34;Noddy&#34; Boffin, a low-born but kindly clerk who becomes &#34;the Golden Dustman.&#34; Charles Dickens&#39;s last complete novel, &#34;Our Mutual Friend encompasses the great themes of his earlier works: the pretensions of the nouveaux riches, the ingenuousness of the aspiring poor, and the unfailing power of wealth to corrupt all who crave it. With its flavorful cast of characters and numerous subplots, &#34;Our Mutual Friend is one of Dickens&#39;s most complex--and satisfying--novels.</p><h2>Business and Society: Stakeholders, Ethics, Public Policy</h2><p><p><strong>Business and Society Working Together</strong></p>In a world economy that is becoming increasingly integrated and interdependent, the relationship between business and society is becoming ever more complex.

Well versed in the old Gaelic myths as well as those of other cultures, he wrote a number of books for children that retell these old tales. Using the story of Jason and the Argonauts as a vehicle, Colum employs the character of Orpheus, who is accompanying the Argonauts, to tell us the stories of Prometheus, Theseus, and Heracles, among others, as the adventurers journey past particular locales associated with their respective exploits. Williams's voice is a fine match with the text, which is written in a style that is eloquent but that may seem archaic to the contemporary listener. His deep, resonant voice has something of the quality of an oracle. His delivery is subtly nuanced, and this work will be a real treat for the listener who sticks with it.

It emerged as a website and blog when friends Aimee Trudeau, Emily Nielson, and Mai-Yan Kwan joined forces to share their love of wilderness, outdoor education experiences, and knowledge of backcountry cooking through classes, workshops, catering events, and easy yet exciting recipes. <br><br> Now, their new book, <i>Dirty Gourmet: Food for Your Outdoor Adventures</i>, extends their mission to get more people to eat well outdoors and have fun doing it! It emphasizes healthy eating with fresh ingredients, efficient techniques, and global flavors. Breakfast, trail meals, sweet and savory snacks, dinners, appetizers, side dishes, desserts, even refreshing camp drinks&#x2015;it&#x2019;s all here! Camp cooks can choose recipes based on the type of activity they are pursuing&#x2015;from picnics, day hikes, and car camping to backcountry adventures by foot, bike, or paddle&#x2015;as well as find recipes perfect for large groups. <br><br> Recipes are organized by activity:<br> <ul> <li>Car campers can relax around the fire with Ember Roasted Baba Ghanoush and Mason Jar Sangria before diving into One Pot Pasta Puttanesca and Grilled Green Bean Salad, with Maple Syrup Dumplings for dessert.</li> <li>Day hikers will want to take a break on the trail with Spicy Tofu Jerky and Curried Chickpea Salad or maybe a Pressed Sandwich with Sundried Tomato Pesto.</li> <li>Backpackers can start their day with Fried Grits Scramble with Greens, Leeks, and Bacon and recharge in the evening with Soba Noodles with Sweet Chili Chicken and a Hibiscus Chia Cooler.</li></ul> To simplify packing and planning, each section offers a base kit checklist of needed supplies along with tips on getting organized, preparing ingredients, and cooking with different methods. Complemented by full-color photos, each recipe features insights from the authors, any additional tools needed, quick-reference icons, step-by-step instructions for what to prepare at home and in camp, plus creative variations.</p><p>The inspiration for Dirty Gourmet came out of Aimee and Mai-Yan&#x2019;s four-month bike tour across North America several years ago. It was a completely self-sustained trip with the majority of their days ending at a campsite. This made for a lot of camp meals and experimentation with food in the outdoors. When they came back, their friend Emily was just ending three years of living in the mountains and working as an outdoor science teacher. With all three women facing a crossroads, they decided to combine their love of wilderness and shared knowledge about the importance of a good meal in the backcountry and create an outdoor food blog.<br><br> On New Year's Eve of 2009 at Leo Carillo State Park, at the base of the Santa Monica Mountains in Southern California, they acquired three campsites, rolled in with a teardrop trailer, and set up a camping party to host and feed their 20 closest friends and family. With delicious food, great company, and a clear starry night (after two rainy plan-and-prep days), Dirty Gourmet was born. <br><br> Dirty Gourmet has grown organically since Aimee, Mai-Yan, and Emily started six years ago, allowing them to connect with people in the outdoors in many different ways. They have volunteered at trail cleanups, given lectures for the Sierra Club and REI, contributed to Backpacker Magazine, and even dabbled in food production. <br><br> More recently they&#x2019;ve focused their efforts on catering and teaching outdoor cooking workshops. Participating in such events has allowed the Dirty Gourmet gals to interact directly with their audience, giving them the opportunity to learn as much as they teach. Through these experiences, they&#x2019;ve gained a better view of the challenges others have with cooking in the wild. Dirty Gourmet&#x2019;s priority is to get more people to eat well outdoors, and they&#x2019;ve found that working face-to-face with their fans and followers is the best and most authentic way to do so. <br><br> About Dirty Gourmet <br> http://www.dirtygourmet.com/ <br> @dirtygourmet <br> facebook.com/dirtygourmet <br> instagram.com/dirtygourmet<br><br>Emily Nielson&#x2019;s first real experience in the outdoor industry was an Outward Bound trip in North Carolina when she was 15. Though she had often been camping with her family, this trip revealed to her that she could make a living in the outdoors&#x2015;and that those who do so have a significant impact on the people they bring outside with them. Through the outdoors, Emily gained a sense of self-confidence and self-reliance that she feels she could not have acquired any other way. After graduating from Florida State University, where she studied Conservation Biology and Philosophy, Emily moved to California to teach at an outdoor science school, and she has remained in the outdoor industry ever since. She is currently a Sales Manager for REI in the Southern California region. She loves to rock climb, backpack, trail run, ski, and mountain bike regularly, and she is always looking for tricks to make cooking for these activities quick and easy, without having to resort to pre-packaged dreck! � Hometown: Upland, CA � Quote: &#x201c;The wilderness is my comfort zone, and I want to share that feeling with everyone.&#x201d;<br><br>Aimee Trudeau started cooking when she was a young teenager, reading her mom&#x2019;s Bon Appetit magazines after school and then cooking elaborate meals for dinner while her folks were still at work. Her family went camping nearly every weekend when she was growing up, and some of her earliest outdoor memories also involve food&#x2015;watching coffee percolate on a camp stove, preparing simple but delicious camp meals. Her obsession with food continued into college where she studied Food Science, and once she started camping as an adult, she began to experiment with more interesting food options. Four months of bike touring took Aimee&#x2019;s cooking to the next level, and made her realize how different her camp food was compared to other campers she met. Today, she loves experimenting with interesting forms of cooking such as dehydrating, baking, and fermenting. � Hometown: Valencia, CA � Quote: &#x201c;I follow a plant-based diet, which brings it's own challenges, especially when trying to please my finicky four-year-old twins.&#x201d;<br><br>Mai-Yan Katherine Kwan grew up in Quebec City, Canada, the product of Chinese and French Canadian parents. Both cultures are very food-centric, which helped develop her palate early on (for her 8th birthday party she requested foie gras and ice cream cake). Her first experiences outdoors were at her grandparents&#x2019; house in the Quebec countryside; the nearby forest and river became her personal sanctuary fostering a great sense of play and adventure. When Mai-Yan moved to California to attend art school, the freshness and year-round availability of produce expanded her cooking arena, and her thinking about food turned more serious. She became obsessed with documenting family recipes, and even designed a cookbook of traditional Chinese recipes after weeks of shadowing her grandma and dad while they cooked. At the same time, she rediscovered camping and cycling, and slowly became a rock climber and hiker. A graphic designer, Mai-Yan also teaches at Art Center College of Design and travels as much as possible. Recent adventures include snorkeling in the Galapagos and sleeping in the Amazonian treetops of Brazil. � Hometown: Los Angeles, CA � Quote: &#x201c;I&#x2019;m very detail oriented, which is ideal for my graphic design career, and for a perfectly chopped salad.&#x201d;Dirty Gourmet: Food for Your Outdoor Adventures is for foodies who want to make great food a part of the outdoors adventure.... [F]resh ingredients are emphasized, an international culinary approach is presented, and meals from appetizers and snacks to dinners and drinks include options for vegans and vegetarians as well as meat-eaters.

Favorite theme park attractions, most notably the "It's A Small World" boat ride, originally created for the 1964 New York World's Fair, were also among her designs. Now the story behind one of Walt's favorite artists is celebrated in this delightful volume of whimsical art and insightful commentary. In her prime, Mary Blair was an amazingly prolific American artist who enlivened and influenced the not-so-small worlds of film, print, theme parks, architectural decor, and advertising. Her art represented and communicated pure pleasure to the viewer. Mary Blair's personal flair was at one with the imagery that flowed effortlessly and continually from her brush for more than half a century. Walt Disney loved her art and championed it at the Studio. The two shared many sensibilities, including a childlike fondness for playfulness in imagery. <br></p><p><br>JOHN CANEMAKER is an Academy Award and Emmy Award-winning animation filmmaker, and a tenured professor and director of the film animation program at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts.

He lives in New York City and Bridgehampton.<b>PRAISE FOR PAPER DREAMS: THE ART &amp; ARTISTS OF DISNEY STORYBOARDS</b><br><br>"Paper Dreams is comics and animation historian Canemaker's celebration of Disney's greatest contribution to filmmaking, the storyboard. Developed as a way of visually communicating a script, the storyboard has become a commonplace of filmmaking-and not just for animated films. Canemaker examines the creative processes of the Disney studio and profiles such individual talents as Bill Peet, Ted Sears, and-surprise!-Walt Disney, whom he presents as an artist rather than as an impresario. A veteran observer of animation and a gainfully employed academic, Canemaker delivers measured accolades that are far more impressive than the usual Disney corporate rah-rah."&#x2015;<b><i><strong>American Library Association <em>Booklist</em></strong></i></b><br><br>"This book is Disney's love letter, or maybe a thank you note, to the legacy of Mary Blair. It features so much of her beautiful work, all in vivid color, with notes about what inspired which piece, how they are developed, and when they were drawn.

Before her final hour, an enigmatic figure known as Brrr&#x2014;the Cowardly Lion&#x2014;arrives searching for information about Elphaba Thropp, the Wicked Witch of the West.

I have had such warm reader response to <i>Wicked</i> and <i>Son of a Witch</i>, both initially and in the years since, that the thought of adding to the series made me feel--well, cowardly. I resisted for a while. But courage comes to those who wait, sometimes: so here is volume three. </p> <p><i>A Lion Among Men</i> follows the peripatetic career of the Cowardly Lion. First seen in <i>Wicked</i> as a lion cub culled from his pride for the purpose of laboratory experimentation, the Lion (known as Brrr) makes his name in that little Matter of Dorothy about which all of Oz is still talking. But one doesn&#x2019;t necessarily become lion-hearted by going after public approval, by racking up those medals and titles and golden statuettes at award ceremonies. </p> <p>Tarnished with scandal of every stripe, Brrr is loathed by the Animals who believe he betrayed them in helping Dorothy do in the Witch. He fares no better trying to live as a lion among men. When civil war breaks out in Oz, Brrr is caught in the line of fire as he interviews the mysterious old oracle, Yackle, about the sources of Elphaba&#x2019;s power. He must choose how much approval he can live without. A bit player all his life, he may yet be the linchpin on which the prosecution of the war rests. </p> <p>When I travel abroad (and the continuing success of the musical <i>Wicked</i> has brought me to countries where it is now playing), I am sometimes met with bemusement about the origins of the material--a children&#x2019;s book made famous by a musical film for children!--how can this serve as a proper metaphor for a meditation about predestination and free will, about political opportunism and personal valor? </p> <p>Maybe, I say, you have to be an American to see that a vaudeville comedian in baggy lion-pajamas, as Burt Lahr seemed to me, has just as much right to inspire a story about the education of a hero as any Siegfried or Lancelot or Joan of Arc. </p> <p>And if they reply, <i>You have some nerve!</i>I answer <i>Thank you. I hope so. </i></p> <p>And I do thank you for your lion-hearted confidence in these wicked novels. </p> <p>-- Gregory </p><p>Gregory Maguire is the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister</em>; <em>Lost</em>; <em>Mirror Mirror</em>; and the Wicked Years, a series that includes <em>Wicked</em>, <em>Son of a Witch</em>, <em>A Lion Among Men</em>, and <em>Out of Oz</em>.

Or making the right investments. Or breaking down organizational silos. All of these things may help but there&#x2019;s only one way to ensure sustained innovation: you need to <i>lead</i> it and with a special kind of leadership. <i>Collective Genius</i> shows you how. <br><br>Preeminent leadership scholar Linda Hill, along with former Pixar tech wizard Greg Brandeau, MIT researcher Emily Truelove, and <i>Being the Boss</i> coauthor Kent Lineback, found among leaders a widely shared, and mistaken, assumption: that a good&#x201d; leader in all other respects would also be an effective leader of innovation. The truth is, leading innovation takes a distinctive kind of leadership, one that unleashes and harnesses the collective genius&#x201d; of the people in the organization.<br><br>Using vivid stories of individual leaders at companies like Volkswagen, Google, eBay, and Pfizer, as well as nonprofits and international government agencies, the authors show how successful leaders of innovation don&#x2019;t create a vision and try to make innovation happen themselves. Rather, they create and sustain a culture where innovation is allowed to happen again and again an environment where people are both <i>willing</i> and <i>able</i> to do the hard work that innovative problem solving requires.<br><br><i>Collective Genius</i> will not only inspire you; it will give you the concrete, practical guidance you need to build innovation into the fabric of your business.<br></p><p><b>Linda A.

Jones.</p><p><em>The Known World</em> tells the story of Henry Townsend, a black farmer and former slave who falls under the tutelage of William Robbins, the most powerful man in Manchester County, Virginia. Making certain he never circumvents the law, Townsend runs his affairs with unusual discipline. But when death takes him unexpectedly, his widow, Caldonia, can't uphold the estate's order, and chaos ensues. Jones has woven a footnote of history into an epic that takes an unflinching look at slavery in all its moral complexities.</p></p><p>Set in Manchester County, Virginia, 20 years before the Civil War began, Edward P. Jones's debut novel, <i>The Known World</i>, is a masterpiece of overlapping plot lines, time shifts, and heartbreaking details of life under slavery. Caldonia Townsend is an educated black slaveowner, the widow of a well-loved young farmer named Henry, whose parents had bought their own freedom, and then freed their son, only to watch him buy himself a slave as soon as he had saved enough money. Although a fair and gentle master by the standards of the day, Henry Townsend had learned from former master about the proper distance to keep from one's property. After his death, his slaves wonder if Caldonia will free them. When she fails to do so, but instead breaches the code that keeps them separate from her, a little piece of Manchester County begins to unravel. Impossible to rush through, <i>The Known World</i> is a complex, beautifully written novel with a large cast of characters, rewarding the patient reader with unexpected connections, some reaching into the present day. <i>--Regina Marler</i><p>Edward P.

His presentation can be easily understood by novice, student, or theologian. I can't wait for more." Dr. Ron Woolever, Shammah Ministries (Azle, Texas) <br> "Everything God has ever done has meaning, layers of meaning. . . and purpose. To learn His meanings and purpose is to know God Himself better.

I was suddenly swept away by the magnificent symbolism and vibrant truth the feasts portray. His perspective as a Jewish believer brought up in a traditional home made the Old Testament Feasts come alive as never before. His insight and attention to detail is phenomenal. Who could have guessed it was all about Jesus Christ? Compelling, enlightening and powerful teaching!" --Dave Weeden, Producer/Director of <i>The King Is Coming</i> telecast<br><br>"Sam Nadler is one of today's most solid Messianic Jewish teachers. He brings fascinating insights without losing sight of major scriptural truths. He is doctrinally sound and yet calls for Christians to look afresh for new discoveries in the Word. And he demonstrates with undeniable clarity how the Feasts and Holy Days of Israel are of importance to the Church today, indeed, how they are ultimately witnesses to Yeshua the Messiah.

Every Christian knows it is imperative to keep the tongue under control but, sooner or later, finds he cannot do so himself. Derek Prince provides clear, biblical steps to discipline the tongue so your words will be spoken for God&#x2019;s glory and your blessing!</p><p>Since DEATH and LIFE are in the power of the tongue, it is imperative to know how it may be healed.&#34;A wholesome tongue is a tree of life...&#34; Proverbs 15:4Sooner of later every Christian knows it is imperative to control the tongue but finds he cannot. Derek Prince gives the reader clear biblical steps to discipline the tongue.<b>Derek Prince </b>(1915&#x2013;2003) was born in Bangalore, India, into a British military family. He was educated as a scholar of classical languages at Eton College and Cambridge University in England and later at Hebrew University, Israel. As a student, he was a philosopher and self-proclaimed agnostic. While in the British Medical Corps during World War II, Prince began to study the Bible as a philosophical work. Converted through a powerful encounter with Jesus Christ, he was baptized in the Holy Spirit a few days later. This life-changing experience altered the whole course of his life, which he thereafter devoted to studying and teaching the Bible as the Word of God.<br> Internationally recognized as a Bible scholar and spiritual patriarch, Derek Prince taught and ministered on six continents for more than sixty years. Until a few years before his death at the age of 88, he traveled the world, imparting God&#x2019;s revealed truth, praying for the sick and afflicted, and sharing his prophetic insights into world events in the light of Scripture. He is the author of over eighty books, six hundred audio teachings, and one hundred video teachings, many of which have been translated and published in more than one hundred languages. He pioneered teaching on such groundbreaking themes as generational curses, the biblical significance of Israel, and demonology.<br> Derek Prince Ministries, with its international headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina, continues to distribute his teachings and to train missionaries, church leaders, and congregations through its worldwide national offices. It is estimated that Derek Prince&#x2019;s messages have reached more than half the globe through his books, CDs, and daily radio program, which is now known as<i> Derek Prince Legacy Radio</i>. In 2002 he said, &#x201c;It is my desire&#x2014;and I believe the Lord&#x2019;s desire&#x2014;that this ministry continue the work, which God began through me over sixty years ago, until Jesus returns.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>I&#39;m in Charge of Celebrations (Aladdin Picture Books)</h2><p>From the highly acclaimed team of Byrd Baylor and Peter Parnall comes the story of a girl who shares her love for desert life as she tells of treasured experiences like dancing in the wind on Dust Devil Day or sleeping outside on a hot summer night during The Time of the Falling Stars. Baylor&#39;s radiant prose-poem and Parnall&#39;s exquisite illustrations combine to create a joyous celebration of the human spirit.</p><p>Byrd Baylor lives and writes in Arizona, presenting images of the Southwest and an intense connection between the land and the people. Her prose illustrates vividly the value of simplicity, the natural world, and the balance of life within it.Grade 1-4 Another collaboration set in the desert from this author/artist team. The styles are consistent: typically twin columns of very short lines of prose set into double-page spreads of intense colors and large white spaces. This is a paean to the forces of nature active in the desert, and a young woman's love of her environment that motivates many private celebrations: Coyote Day, Dust Devil Day, The Time of Falling Stars. The words are personal descriptions of responses to events. The images, however, are much more universal, abstract visualizations. Again the black line helps define horizons, animals, and dust devils (whirlwinds), but it's the sweep of pure color shapes appearing almost stenciled in their sharp-edgedness that will grab children's attention. Parnall can make his audience see empty space as solid form, can juxtapose a red against a pale blue and set the page on fire. But he can also add travel poster cacti that destroy the mysticism of his suggestive abstractions. Still, the partnership thrives in this latest work.

In fact, it has been by no means uncommon for a child to be born into this world only to be patiently and lovingly reared by religious maniacs, who believe that the best way to keep the sun on its course or to ensure a rich harvest is to lead him by tender hand into a field or to a mountaintop and bury, butcher, or burn him alive as offering to an invisible God. The notion that Jesus Christ died for our sins and that his death constitutes a successful propitiation of a &#x201c;loving&#x201d; God is a direct and undisguised inheritance of the superstitious bloodletting that has plagued bewildered people throughout history. . .</p></p><p>Sam Harris is the author of the <i>New York Times </i>best seller, <i>The End of Faith: Religion, Terror, and the Future of Reason, </i>which won the 2005 PEN Award for Nonfiction.

It is a living history of the Appalachia I lived and loved as a child. How it looked and sounded and tasted. How it was. I was as faithful to those places and people as memory and the passage of time would allow--to do less would be a disservice to the remarkable family and place this book is meant to honor. Although names of all family members and many other characters are real, identifying characteristics of some places and people were changed to ensure their privacy. The stories in&nbsp;<i><b>Running on Red Dog Road&nbsp;</b></i>were recreated, not exactly as they were, for that clearly would not be possible, but as seen through my eyes as a child. As I wrote, I ask myself the same question over and over--what would Grandma think? I think she would be pleased. Mercy me, she'd say, here you've gone and set us down in a book. Yes ma'am, I'd say, I hope I have done her and all the others proud. Their influence on my life was and is immeasurable.<br>.&nbsp;<br>Begun as a legacy to my progeny,&nbsp;<b><i>Running on Red Dog Road</i></b><i>&nbsp;</i>ended as a tribute to their forebears, the family to whom I owe everything. It is, then, a book of atonement. Resurrecting the dead, living with them, and burying them again was profoundly moving. It took me six years to complete this book, and for several of those years I wrote nothing at all--blindsided by memories that struck me dumb. They were mostly good memories, deeply rooted in family and mountains and the culture of Appalachia, so I was unprepared for the emotional physical spiritual toll this writing could and did exact--and puzzled too. After all, I come from stoic stock, not given to unseemly histrionics. I took after this kin, or so I claimed. I never cried. Not at my grandpa's funeral, nor my grandma's, many years later. Not at my sister's or brother's or mother's. So the tears that overcame me as I relived our lives on that red dog road so long ago were an enigma--that is, until I realized every family member I wrote about is dead. Except for me. And the heartbreak is they died not knowing how I felt about them. They couldn't have. Until I began to write their stories, I didn't know myself.<p>Drema Hall Berkheimer was born in a coal camp in Appalachia, the child of a West Virginia coal miner who was killed in the mines, a Rosie the Riveter mother, and devout Pentecostal grandparents.

Practically unbelievable." -- IDENTICAL <br></i><br>Kaeleigh and Raeanne are 16-year-old identical twins, the daughters of a district court judge father and politician mother running for US Congress. Everything on the surface seems fine, but underneath run very deep and damaging secrets. What really happened when the girls were 7 years old in that car accident that Daddy caused? And why is Mom never home, always running far away to pursue some new dream? Raeanne goes after painkillers, drugs, alcohol, and sex to dull her pain and anger. Kaeleigh always tries so hard to be the good girl -- her father's perfect little flower. But when the girls were 9, Daddy started to turn to his beloved Kaeleigh in ways a father never should and has been sexually abusing her for years. For Raeanne, she needs to numb the pain of not being Daddy's favorite; for Kaeleigh, she wants to do everything she can to feel something normal, even if it means cutting herself and vomiting after every binge. <br><br>How Kaeleigh and Raeanne figure out just what it means to be whole again when their entire world has been torn to shreads is the guts and heart of this powerful, disturbing, and utterly remarkable book.</p><p>Do twins begin in the womb? Or in a better place?<br><br>Kaeleigh and Raeanne are identical down to the dimple. As daughters of a district-court judge father and a politician mother, they are an all-American family&#x2015;on the surface. Behind the fa�ade each sister has her own dark secret, and that&#x2019;s where their differences begin. <br><br>For Kaeleigh, she&#x2019;s the misplaced focus of Daddy&#x2019;s love, intended for a mother whose presence on the campaign trail means absence at home. All that Raeanne sees is Daddy playing a game of favorites&#x2015;and she is losing. If she has to lose, she will do it on her own terms, so she chooses drugs, alcohol, and sex. <br><br>Secrets like the ones the twins are harboring are not meant to be kept&#x2015;from each other or anyone else. Pretty soon it&#x2019;s obvious that neither sister can handle it alone, and one sister must step up to save the other, but the question is&#x2015;who?<br>Ellen Hopkins is the #1&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling author of fourteen young adult novels, as well as the adult novels&nbsp;<i>Triangles,&nbsp;Collateral</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Love Lies Beneath</i>.

A solid sense of self-worth is the single most important factor in determining our happiness in life and our success in work and relationships. With it, virtually all things are possible; without it, even victories can feel like defeats. Raising low self-esteem is an essential part of the healing process for those who are recovering from addictions and dependencies&#x2014;and for anyone who still feels the pain of childhood traumas or other emotional wounds.<br> <br>This book tackles important subjects such as: why self-esteem seems so fragile, how to define ourselves in terms of our own standards and values, why attitude is so important when we make mistakes, the difference between conceit and self-approval, how self-doubt triggers unattractive behaviors, and how self-esteem blooms when we have a sense of purpose in life.</p><p><b>Earnie Larsen</b>&nbsp;is the author of&nbsp;<i>Stage II Recovery</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Stage II Relationships,</i>&nbsp;and coauthor with his sister&nbsp;<b>Carol Hegarty</b>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<i>Days of Healing, Days of Joy.</i><b>Chapter 1</b><br><br><b>January 1</b><br><br><i>Even though time be real, to realize the unimportance of time is the gate of wisdom.</i><br><br>Bertrand Russell<br><br>Most of us measure the realities of life by time. Without our even being aware of it, the context of time directs, defines, channels, and limits most of our thought patterns. Concepts like past, present, and future divide our lives as neatly as three acts divide a play: One begins where the other ends, until the play is finished. That is the outer world.<br><br>But clock ticks and calendar pages don't control the action in the inner world. As we develop the inner awareness that develops self-esteem, we get in touch with a different reality. In the kingdom of our own minds and hearts we discover a self that is neither old nor young, neither beginning nor ending, but just <i>being.</i> In this world there is no such thing as before or after, on time or late. There is only the peace and serenity of <i>now</i> -- the now that was, is, and will be.<br><br>The healthiest people have dual citizenship: They live in both worlds. When they are saddened that some prized and precious time is passing by, they are also comforted by knowing that the richness of human experience is timeless. All that was good lives on in the inner world -- not lost, not wasted, not past. In the soul there is only the eternal present.<br><br><b>Soul making has nothing to do with time as the world measures it.<br><br>January 2</b><br><br><i>Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.</i><br><br>"The Desiderata"<br><br>Self-esteem is not static. Within boundaries, depending on the ebb and flow of the tide of our lives, our sense of well-being naturally fluctuates. Many of our low points, however, have not so much to do with a particular problem as they do with the state of mind we bring to that problem.<br><br>We may not always have control over certain fears. If we were once badly burned, for example, we may always have a residual overreaction to fire -- and there are, of course, many kinds of fire. But we do have control over the fatigue and loneliness that set us up for fear attacks. Of all the efforts we may make to bolster self-esteem, avoiding such fatigue and loneliness may be the most important.<br><br>Is it always necessary to work as hard as we do? Can we never take a break or a little nap? When was the last time we took a vacation? And how often do we set aside time for a good long conversation with a friend? Sometimes "alone" is not a healthy place to be. Especially if we're also tired. Those are times when our fears find us most vulnerable.<br><br><b>I will avoid getting too tired to feel good about myself.<br><br>January 3</b><br><i>Comparisons are odious.</i><br><br>Sir John Fortescue<br><br>Talk about a setup! What are we really doing when we compare ourselves with others? Are we simply gathering information -- or are we actually gathering evidence of our own inadequacy? If that's our game, we're sure to win by losing every time.<br><br>Maybe we first learned to make unfavorable comparisons as a form of self-protection. Perhaps our tactic was to put ourselves down quickly -- before "they" could do it for us. As children, we may have used self-effacement to deflect even worse verbal abuse. But we're not children now. And those bullies who lurked in the bushes aren't there anymore -- unless we've internalized and generalized them into everybody who isn't us.<br><br>Do most of the people we know seem better, smarter, handsomer, more interesting than we are? If so, that's a sign that we're still playing out the same old self-defeating pattern. Out of fear, we're volunteering to be "worse" so that those who are "better" won't want to hurt us. After years of practice, self-effacement has become Our habit.<br><br>But we can form a new habit if we want to. We can begin by refusing to idealize people who are in fact the same mixed bag of strengths and weaknesses that we are. We can stop making comparisons to put ourselves down and start taking a look at the worthy people we really are.<br><br><b>Today, I don't need to vandalize my self-image by making unfavorable comparisons.<br><br>January 4</b><br><br><i>The truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.</i><br><br>Legal Oath<br><br>Some truths are harder to face than others.

To their great credit, they've joined forces for mutual comfort and support. But many Adult Children still spend a lot of energy fending off the past instead of accepting it. Understandably, they have more trouble than most in coming to grips with yesterday. Their yesterdays were a nightmare.<br><br>Perhaps their parents were practicing alcoholics or religious zealots or simply unavailable emotionally. Perhaps there was constant fighting, or demeaning remarks were made. Who wouldn't want to forget such misery? Yet that misery really happened; it is an important part of the Adult Child's personal truth.<br><br>Only by acknowledging and accepting that truth can Adult Children be done with it and get on with the task of making today everything it can be. Only then can healing and restoration of a positive self-image begin.<br><br><b>Denial ties me to the past.<br><br>January 5</b><br><br><i>Each is given a bag of tools,<br><br>A shapeless mass and a book of rules;<br><br>And each must make, ere life is flown,<br><br>A stumblingblock or a steppingstone.</i><br><br>R. L. Sharpe<br><br>Who would try to nail boards together without a hammer or change a flat tire without a jack? To deny our need for tools would be ridiculous, wouldn't it? Yet many of us have trouble accepting that we need tools to repair our damaged self-esteem.<br><br>Sheer force of will won't lift a car so that a bad tire can be replaced -- and it won't lift a heavy burden from our spirits either. Insight and knowledge of carpentry can't pound a nail -- nor can insight and knowledge, without the help of tools, pound the dents out of our battered psyches.<br><br>It isn't weak or shameful to admit that a human finger isn't a screwdriver and a human eye isn't a microscope. Why do we resist the idea that spiritual work, like physical work, has its own set of tools? Reading, sharing, praying, attending our support group's meetings -- these are the tools that help us do the job. They aren't optional niceties or crutches. If we need to lay a new foundation, we need to dig a big hole. And if we need to dig a hole, we'd better be willing to use a shovel.<br><br><b>My willingness to use the tools determines the outcome of the job.<br><br>January 6</b><br><br><i>No one may abuse the truth with impunity.</i><br><br>R. Duane Joseph<br><br>A person's integrity is his or her own truth. To live honorably is to abide with the truth we claim as our own. Self-esteem is the sister of integrity; it's the natural result, the by-product, of honorable living. That's why both integrity and self-esteem are affected when we wander from the honorable path.<br><br>When we have affairs, go back on our word, tell half-truths, exaggerate to get approval, we chip away at our integrity. And any chipping away at our integrity undermines our self-esteem. This is the reason that even the smallest dishonorable behaviors are so destructive -- no matter how we justify them.<br><br>If we're involved in any activity that violates our moral code, that runs contrary to our own value system, then we're in self-esteem trouble. All the psychological maneuvering in the world cannot and will not restore serenity to the soul if this involvement continues.<br><br>Is there a basic decision, a letting go, that must take place? Although it may take heroic effort, that turnaround decision will give wings to our self-esteem.<br><br><b>Peace with self is a treasure beyond measure.<br><br>January 7</b><br><br><i>We live in a fantasy world, a world of illusion.

Yet there are those of us who are powerfully attracted to the Superman cape, no matter how many times it failed to flutter before. Something in us keeps forgetting how short a trip it was from the roof to the sidewalk.<br><br>For the sake of our self-esteem, we need to remember how hard the sidewalk is the next time we're tempted to take on a task that can't be done. If we're trying to think for other people, resolve their self-made messes, or rescue them from their own willfulness, we're guaranteeing ourselves another hard fall. And the pity isn't that our attempts keep failing; the pity is that we hurt ourselves trying to do what no one on this side of heaven is allowed to do -- save other people.<br><br>The purest, most noble intentions in the world won't make the Superman cape billow. No matter how loyal or devoted, we are still and only human. Steadfast love and encouragement are the best we have to offer our troubled loved ones. If we want to salvage our self-esteem, we need to accept ourselves and our loved ones, limitations and all. And we need to hang up the Superman cape.<br><br><b>Even in a good cause, my grandiosity is self-defeating.<br><br>January 8</b><br><br><i>Procrastination means paying twice the price when you eventually must act.</i><br><br>T. A. McAloon<br><br>The relationship between procrastination and self-esteem is not coincidental. The reason is that self-esteem slips whenever integrity is sacrificed, and procrastinating always demands the offering up of a tiny piece of our integrity. Heavy-duty procrastination is also a first sign of depression in many people.<br><br>Suffering people say that when they are depressed they feel overwhelmed, overburdened with so much to do there's no hope of ever getting it done, of feeling powerless in the face of insurmountable odds.<br><br>Whatever the specific cause of a depression, however, procrastination often helps to set it up. Many of us have procrastinated until there really is an unmanageable logjam of undoable tasks. Or we allow terrible pressure to build up around a decision that we've put off time and time again. In these ways, procrastination invites depression just as honey invites ants.<br><br><b>Conquering my procrastination may eliminate the need to conquer depression.<br><br>January 9</b><br><i>In thy face I see The map of honor, truth, and loyalty.</i><br><br>William Shakespeare<br><br>What higher honor can we give but to say a person is "true blue," or "faithful to the end"? Loyalty is one of the most endearing and noble of all human qualities. How terribly sad when we place this priceless gift in the wrong hands!<br><br>Many people suffering from low self-esteem have developed faulty boundaries around who is trustworthy and who is not. Of course it isn't <i>trusting</i> itself that threatens self-esteem, but trusting untrustworthy people is always devastating. While everyone makes an honest misjudgment now and then, some of us go on making the same mistake with the same person over and over and over again. Such foolhardiness goes beyond the limits of loyalty.<br><br>Misplaced loyalty, especially if repeated, is evidence of willfulness rather than love. Because self-esteem cannot long endure the battering of betrayal, we need to get honest about what we're doing when we offer ourselves up to people who have let us down. To fail to learn from our past mistakes is to take a hand in our own injury.<br><br><b>My integrity is always lost when I set myself up to be hurt.<br><br>January 10</b><br><br><i>Let not thy Will roar, when thy Power can but whisper.</i><br><br>Thomas Fuller<br><br>Surrender, as taught and understood in Twelve Step programs, is anything but shameful. It means that we call off the war we've been waging against life as it is. It means giving up the losing battle we've been leading with our popguns of delusion and denial. In recovery, surrender is not a sign of weakness but of courage and strength.<br><br>Surrender is critical because delusion and denial prevent any meaningful move forward. The stinking thinking they produce tells us that black is white -- that getting our own sick way is winning, that the enemy is out there rather than in here. The longer and bloodier the battle, the more confused we become.<br><br>To get on with our lives, to have any chance of victory, means that we give up what doesn't work. We stop playing "general." In the face of our well-demonstrated powerlessness, continuing the charade now seems insane -- even to us. Our surrender doesn't signify defeat, but the fact that we are sick and tired of defeat.<br><br><b>The surrender of willfulness is often my first victory.<br><br>January, 11</b><br><br><i>All deep, earnest thinking is but the intrepid effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea, while the wildest winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the treacherous, slavish shore.</i><br><br>Herman Melville<br><br>Building self-esteem takes introspection. But some of us get nervous when we start thinking about ourselves. Somehow it seems wrong to spend so much time digging around in the basements and attics of our personalities. We're afraid we're becoming self-centered, and we feel guilty about it. Haven't we always been taught to avoid selfishness?<br><br>But the search for self-esteem is more like a rescue mission than it is an ego trip. It isn't selfish to try to know and understand ourselves. And taking credit where credit is due shouldn't make us feel guilty any more than taking a paycheck at the end of a hard week. We deserve what we've earned. And all of us have earned more healthy self-regard than we've dared to claim.<br><br>We don't have to worry. Self-centeredness is no more like self-esteem than a flood is like a summer shower. One causes devastation and the other causes growth. If growth is our intention, examining our lives is not only allowable -- it's an absolute necessity. And if introspection makes us uneasy, it's because we're not used to it, not because it's wrong.<br><br><b>Squeamishness about self-scrutiny may spring from my false pride instead of my true humility.<br><br>January 12</b><br><br><i>A successful marriage is an edifice that must be rebuilt every day.</i><br><br>Andr� Maurois<br><br>Without doubt a successful marriage can be a marvelous springboard for our self-esteem. When we are loved we live in the presence of a constantly reflecting mirror that tells us, regardless of all our faults and warts, that we are plenty okay people. What could be better than to have someone who loves you be there to scratch your back in the middle of the night?<br><br>But marriage, like self-esteem, requires daily effort. The bread can be no better than the grain that goes into it. To listen when we would rather not, to compromise when we feel like digging in our heels, to confront problems rather than let them slide on by, guaranteeing a more difficult time later -- all of these are kneading the dough.<br><br>It's a lot easier to dream about the wonderfulness of a finished product than it is to roll up your sleeves every day and do what is necessary to ensure that finished product will be there at day's end.<br><br><b>My precious relationships are worth the extra effort.<br><br>January 13</b><br><br><i>Pessimist -- one who, when he has the choice of two evils, chooses both.</i><br><br>Oscar Wilde<br><br>The only sensible way to live our lives is with optimism -- and a lot of it.

Yet, like meeting a new friend, Wright helps us to find Hebrews full of interest and delight, with a powerful message that comes home to the church of today and tomorrow just as much as it did to the church of yesterday.</p><p>Tom Wright has undertaken a tremendous task: to provide guides to all the books of the New Testament, and to include in them his own translation of the entire text. Each short passage is followed by a highly readable discussion with background information, useful explanations and suggestions, and thoughts as to how the text can be relevant to our lives today. A glossary is included at the back of the book. The series is suitable for group study, personal study, or daily devotions.</p></p><p><p><b>N. T.

He needs the lucrative job the Rajes offer, but he values his pride too much to indulge Trisha&#x2019;s arrogance. And then he discovers that she&#x2019;s the only surgeon who can save his sister&#x2019;s life.</p><p>As the two clash, their assumptions crumble like the spun sugar on one of DJ&#x2019;s stunning desserts.&nbsp;But before a future can be savored there&#x2019;s a past to be reckoned with...</p><p>A family trying to build home in a new land.</p><p>A man who has never felt at home anywhere.</p><p>And a choice to be made between the two. </p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>Award-winning author Sonali Dev writes Bollywood-style love stories that let her explore issues faced by women around the world while still indulging her faith in a happily ever after.

Especially since it&#x2019;s been in the freezer awhile&#x2014;the edges are dry and crusty. But this is about all the cooking Mom chooses to do. She says she likes to leave the fancy stuff to me. Really, though, she just doesn&#x2019;t have the energy to think about fixing anything that doesn&#x2019;t come with directions on the box.<br> <br>Our TV is so old and tiny that I have to lean in to see what Mary Berry is pursing her lips about. The bakers are making English muffins, and she&#x2019;s giving the stink eye to the redheaded guy who didn&#x2019;t let his dough rise enough. If I were on the show, Mary wouldn&#x2019;t have to tell me how long those muffins need to rise. Any fool with a Betty Crocker cookbook or Google knows to let it double. I pick at a shriveled string of cheese on my plate and imagine what I&#x2019;d say if I could send her a note across the ocean.<br> <br>Dear Ms. Berry,<br> <br>As an aspiring baker over here in Tennessee, I&#x2019;d like to tell you how much I love every single one of your recipes, but especially your Cappuccino Coffee Cake. I made it once for my mom, and she said both coffee and cake would never be the same again. I think she meant that in a good way. Also, would you mind sharing your secret to a good scone? Because down here all we&#x2019;ve got are buttermilk biscuits&#x2014;<br> <br>Mom&#x2019;s phone rings and now I&#x2019;m left wishing I had enough sugar to try another batch of scones. The only ones I ever made came out so hard, you had to dunk them in milk to take a bite. Mom hits pause right as Mary is about to call out the top three English muffins. I already know which one will win. It&#x2019;s all about symmetry. They have to look exactly the same.<br> <br>Mom sets her food on the coffee table. She&#x2019;s barely touched it, but she picks up her phone and walks into the hallway. She says &#x201c;hello&#x201d; like the conversation has already run an hour long. It has to be Mema.<br> <br>I saw off another bite of lasagna with my knife and review what I&#x2019;m going to say if the phone rings again and it&#x2019;s about what went down at school today. But there&#x2019;s not a single scenario where I don&#x2019;t get grounded. Grown-up trumps kid like paper beats rock.<br> <br>Mom leans back in from the hallway and mouths, &#x201c;Chew, chew, chew,&#x201d; like I&#x2019;m five and still in feeding therapy.<br> <br>I point at the phone. &#x201c;Talk to your mother.&#x201d;<br> <br>Depending on how Grandpa&#x2019;s been doing lately, this could either be a really quick conversation or a really long one. I take my chances and hit play.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m right about the muffins.<br> <br>When Mom still hasn&#x2019;t come in by the credits, I push back from the table and roll into the hallway.<br> <br>She&#x2019;s sitting on the floor with her legs stuck out and the phone in her lap.<br> <br>&#x201c;How bad was it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He locked your grandmother out of the house and called 911 to report a burglary.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Whoa.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Did the cops show up?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No. He&#x2019;s done it enough times, she reprogrammed the emergency button on the house phone to go to her cell.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Smart.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not smart enough to remember to put out a new Hide-a-Key. She had to get the neighbor to break a window.&#x201d;<br> <br>I can picture it: Grandpa whispering into the yellow phone on the wall about voices and eyes looking in at him from the dark. Poor Mema. I wonder which window they had to bust. I lock the brakes on my chair and hold out a hand. Mom takes it and stands up with a grunt.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nice.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ellie, you&#x2019;re twelve. Just wait until you&#x2019;re my age. You&#x2019;ll make all kinds of noises you never thought you&#x2019;d make.&#x201d;<br> <br>She tries on a smile, but it slides off. I hate it when she does that, pretends everything&#x2019;s rosy because she thinks I can&#x2019;t handle it. But I don&#x2019;t say anything, just grab her plate off the coffee table in the living room and roll on into the kitchen. I don&#x2019;t know the last time Mom ate a meal all the way through. I pop her lasagna into the microwave. If it&#x2019;s not Mema on the line, it&#x2019;s Lauren, my aide, calling to tattle on me, which&#x2014;I check the clock&#x2014;might still happen tonight, with my luck.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m not a bad kid, really I&#x2019;m not.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s just that anybody who sees a girl in a wheelchair thinks she&#x2019;s going to be sunshine and cuddles.<br> <br>Sorry for having an opinion.<br> <br>Sorry for not thanking my lucky stars you get to follow me to the toilet three times a day, and sorry for not loving the fact that someone else has to carry my tray to the table at lunch and that I have to wait at the back of the bus, coughing in the cloud of exhaust, while the wheelchair lift goes down as slow as Christmas.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m sorry for needing a little space.<br> <br>But mostly I&#x2019;m sorry I let the whole being-stuck-in-a-wheelchair thing get to me today. I wish I could have brushed it off like usual. Then I wouldn&#x2019;t be in this mess.<br> <br>Mom wanders in from the hallway and slumps down at the kitchen table. The microwave beeps, and I plop the lasagna in front of her. It slides across the plate like a wet sock, probably tastes like one too by now. She&#x2019;s rubbing her fingertips in a slow circle on the side of her head. I wish she would stop doing that&#x2014;it makes me worry she&#x2019;s going to go bald. I push the plate forward with one finger until it&#x2019;s about to topple off into her lap. She picks up a fork.<br> <br>&#x201c;Chew, chew, chew,&#x201d; I say, and roll into my bedroom to finish my algebra.<br> <br><br> <br>It&#x2019;s almost midnight and I still haven&#x2019;t started my math. I forgot to close the blinds, and the streetlight outside is casting an orangey glow across the walls, but I&#x2019;m too tired to drag myself into my chair and deal with it. The chair&#x2019;s sitting at a right angle to the bed, where Mom always puts it in case I need to get up in the night. Right angles. See, I don&#x2019;t even need the math homework. My current skills are greater than or equal to whatever problem set is due tomorrow.<br> <br>I could probably use some solid pluses and minuses to distract me right now.<br> <br>I can&#x2019;t stop thinking about what happened at lunch. It so wasn&#x2019;t a big deal until everybody made it a big deal. I mean, I get it. Lauren&#x2019;s whole entire job is to chaperone me from place to place, so when I pull a runner and disappear, it kinda makes her look like she&#x2019;s slacking.<br> <br>But Emma Claire wasn&#x2019;t there today. She&#x2019;s basically the one friend I have at school. She also has CP. Birds of a feather and all that. But she only has a limp and can still play soccer. I tell her she&#x2019;s got a &#x201c;touch of CP&#x201d; and I&#x2019;ve got the whole bucketful. We&#x2019;re not close close. But at least we sit together. And when she&#x2019;s gone, it&#x2019;s just me in my cone of silence in the middle of the cafeteria.<br> <br>So there I was, sitting at the end of the row of tables and away from everybody else like a doorstop, and it was loud, and not the kind of loud you can tune out. And it was chili day. The whole place smelled like meat chunks. Barf. So I packed up the sandwich I&#x2019;d made with the cranberry relish and goat cheese, which Mom says isn&#x2019;t a sandwich because it doesn&#x2019;t have meat, and left. I just put it all on my lap and rolled on out and down the back hallway that leads to the exit doors by the gym.<br> <br>I sat in a little ray of sunlight that snuck past the dumpsters outside and finished my lunch, and then the bell rang and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I just needed another minute, was all. Except when Lauren found me, I might have been dozing in the sun spot and it might have been after too much &#x201c;travel time&#x201d; had passed for me to blame it on the chair. But I wasn&#x2019;t trying to skip class. Really.<br> <br>The thing is, kids skip all the time, and yeah, they get in trouble. But nobody freaks out about it like they do with me because I&#x2019;m a health risk. And okay, yes, it was maybe a teensy bit antisocial to go eat in a corner by the dumpsters, but sometimes it&#x2019;s all just too much. I get tired of bearing witness to everybody else&#x2019;s normal.<br> <br>I never got sent to time-out when I was little. I think the teachers couldn&#x2019;t bring themselves to lock me and my wheels in the corner. But I wish I could now. I wish I could just declare a giant TIME-OUT from school and people and take a long nap in the sun.<br> <br>I think about The Great British Bake Off again and how happy the winner looked, holding up his English muffins like a doof next to tiny Mary Berry. I bet no one bothers Mary when she wants to eat alone. I bet she dines like a queen. One day I will write her a real letter and ask her to tea. I could handle company if it were Mary. We would sit in easy silence and let the food speak for us.<br> <br><br> <br>Two days later I&#x2019;m at school, sitting out front by the curb and waiting for Mom to pick me up. It&#x2019;s freezing. I don&#x2019;t care what they say about winters in the South; it still feels like a bucket of ice water thrown over you every time you go outside.<br> <br>&#x201c;You want your jacket, honey?&#x201d;<br> <br>Lauren stands next to me with one hand on the back of my wheelchair. I shake my head, don&#x2019;t look at her. I&#x2019;ve got my backpack in my lap with my jacket inside. If I wanted it, I&#x2019;d get it. I&#x2019;m working too hard not to be nervous about this appointment to have any room left to make small talk with Lauren. It&#x2019;s lunchtime and this is usually her &#x201c;Ellie break,&#x201d; but since the &#x201c;runaway&#x201d; incident, she hasn&#x2019;t given me an inch of space. I can tell she&#x2019;s ready to go inside to the teachers&#x2019; lounge, down a Lean Cuisine, and check her IG. I hate it when she calls me &#x201c;honey.&#x201d; She&#x2019;s probably twenty-five at most. I wish we could just wait together in the quiet.<br> <br>&#x201c;We need to talk about what happened the other day, Ellie.&#x201d;<br> <br>I look straight ahead. I can feel her hands on her hips. She already called Mom yesterday, just like I knew she would. Mom cut all my screen time for a week. A WEEK. I wanted to explain myself, but I couldn&#x2019;t get the words out. I&#x2019;d rather lose screen time than tell Mom the truth and have her think I&#x2019;m &#x201c;not coping,&#x201d; as she likes to say.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ellie, honey, you cannot wander off by yourself after lunch without checking in with me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I was going to class.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t believe science is by the gym, last time I checked.&#x201d;<br> <br>She should save the teacher tone for the teachers. I wheel around to face her and tap my forehead. &#x201c;Oh, you know, little ol&#x2019; me just gets turned around sometimes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ellie, enough. You know your educational plan requires that I accompany you from the bus, between classes, and to and from the restroom.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So you&#x2019;re saying I&#x2019;m in trouble for&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. going to my class?&#x201d;<br> <br>That&#x2019;s the thing about needing an extra-special plan just to go to school. Sometimes it helps. And sometimes it&#x2019;s the leash you get tangled in.<br> <br>For a second she almost looks embarrassed, and I start to feel a little bad for giving her the guilt trip when she&#x2019;s not even the one who makes the rules. But then Mom flies up in the van and throws the automatic doors open like she&#x2019;s at the Daytona 500. She&#x2019;s an English teacher up at the high school and has to use her planning period to take me to my doctor&#x2019;s appointments. It&#x2019;s always a race across town to the children&#x2019;s hospital. But we&#x2019;ve gotten only one ticket. The other times the cop felt sorry for us. On occasion this whole &#x201c;crippled kid&#x201d; thing works in my favor.<br> <br>Today we&#x2019;re on our way to see the neurologist, the &#x201c;head doctor&#x201d; who reads my brain waves. It&#x2019;s supposed to be science-y, but it feels a little like visiting a psychic and watching her pretend to tell my fortune. I&#x2019;m trying my best not to pay attention to the worry that&#x2019;s doing laps in my stomach. This appointment is a big one. It might really tell my future, and I&#x2019;m not sure I&#x2019;m ready to hear it.<br> <br>&#x201c;Where is your jacket?&#x201d;<br> <br>Despite the rush, Mom has all the time in the world to look me over while I&#x2019;m riding the lift that folds down onto the curb like a hand opening and carries me up and inside the van. It&#x2019;s like the world&#x2019;s slowest amusement park ride. But she doesn&#x2019;t wait for an answer, because I&#x2019;m finally up now and locked in. We&#x2019;re already going to be late. And I&#x2019;m secretly glad. If it&#x2019;s bad news, it&#x2019;s bad news a few minutes later. I watch Lauren shrink and finally disappear out the back window.<br> <br>Mom keeps checking her phone. I reach as far as I can and grab it from her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ellie!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No texting while driving, young lady.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t texting. I was about to text.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Same difference. Same eyes off the road. Text who?&#x201d;<br> <br>Mom doesn&#x2019;t answer.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t know why I ask. I know who. Dad. Dad the lawyer who never calls or comes to anything because he&#x2019;s busy with his new family. Mom says he hopes to run for mayor someday. I bet he practices acceptance speeches in the mirror. The therapist Mom made me see for a while when I turned ten and starting ignoring Dad&#x2019;s phone calls and emails said I have &#x201c;unresolved issues.&#x201d; She said I needed to learn to &#x201c;express the hurt&#x201d; if I ever wanted to have a &#x201c;meaningful relationship&#x201d; with him. But honestly, it&#x2019;s been Mom and me for so long, I think I&#x2019;d rather just leave him to his bright and shiny new family.<br> <br>&#x201c;He might make it this time,&#x201d; she says eventually as we pull into the parking garage and the radio goes fuzzy.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure. Sure.&#x201d;<br> <br><br> <br>Mom and I both know Dad won&#x2019;t be here. Even though this is kind of a huge appointment, epic maybe if it pans out the way we want, he still won&#x2019;t show. He doesn&#x2019;t do doctors or hospitals or sickness of any kind&#x2014;which explains the whole leaving us when I was still a not-toddling toddler. Whenever he visits, I make a point to lean over and drool a little. This would be one of the &#x201c;defense mechanisms&#x201d; the therapist mentioned.<br> <br>The doors of the hospital whoosh open, and a blast of heat smacks me in the face. The elevator to the doctor&#x2019;s office tower smells like hand sanitizer and toilets, and it makes me wish I were back in class, which is saying something. A family sits under the television in the corner. The man has a long beard, and the woman wears a bonnet. Their little girl has neon leg braces, and she fiddles with their Velcro under her skirts. I want to tell the girl that the braces aren&#x2019;t as bad as they seem, that she&#x2019;ll get used to them. And I would tell her, if my voice weren&#x2019;t caught on a tangle of nerves.<br> <br>I stare at the TV for distraction.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s always PAW Patrol.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You used to love PAW Patrol.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, when I was, like, five.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, there are a lot of little kids here.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Which leads me to my point.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Which is?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why do I have to go to the little-kid doctor? It&#x2019;s me and a thousand seven-year-olds in pajamas with their Build-A-Bears.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;When you turn eighteen, you can go wherever you like.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Six years and counting.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Just don&#x2019;t count too fast, okay?&#x201d; Mom whispers, and untucks the end of my ponytail from my sweatshirt. Her hand is shaking, and I lean into it for a second like a cat until it stills.<br> <br>She looks back down at her phone. Still no text from Dad. I&#x2019;m half thinking about what comes next and half still mad over my conversation with Lauren earlier, when the door opens and a nurse steps out. &#x201c;Cowan?&#x201d;<br> <br>Both of our heads snap up like we&#x2019;re in trouble. We take a deep breath at the same time, like we&#x2019;re going underwater, and then I wheel forward and Mom gets up to follow.<br> <br>The exam ...</p><h2>One Amazing Thing</h2><p><b>An acclaimed novel by the author of <i>The Mistress of Spices</i>, and <i>Before We Visit the Goddess</i>. </b><b>Jhumpa Lahiri praises: "<em>One Amazing Thing</em> collapses the walls dividing characters and cultures; what endures is a chorus of voices in one single room.</b>"<br><br>Late afternoon sun sneaks through the windows of a passport and visa office in an unnamed American city. Most customers and even most office workers have come and gone, but nine people remain. A punky teenager with an unexpected gift. An upper-class Caucasian couple whose relationship is disintegrating. A young Muslim-American man struggling with the fallout of 9/11. A graduate student haunted by a question about love. An African-American ex-soldier searching for redemption. A Chinese grandmother with a secret past. And two visa office workers on the verge of an adulterous affair.<br><br> When an earthquake rips through the afternoon lull, trapping these nine characters together, their focus first jolts to their collective struggle to survive. There's little food. The office begins to flood. Then, at a moment when the psychological and emotional stress seems nearly too much for them to bear, the young graduate student suggests that each tell a personal tale, "one amazing thing" from their lives, which they have never told anyone before. And as their surprising stories of romance, marriage, family, political upheaval, and self-discovery unfold against the urgency of their life-or-death circumstances, the novel proves the transcendent power of stories and the meaningfulness of human expression itself. From Chitra Divakaruni, author of such finely wrought, bestselling novels as <i>Sister of My Heart, The Palace of Illusions</i>, and <i>The Mistress of Spices</i>, comes her most compelling and transporting story to date. <i>One Amazing Thing</i> is a passionate creation about survival--and about the reasons to survive.</p><p>Chitra Divakaruni is an award-winning and bestselling novelist and poet. She is the author of 14 books in all, including the short story collection <em>The Unknown Errors of Our Lives</em> and the novels <em>Sister of My Heart</em>, <em>The Mistress of Spices</em>, <em>Queen of Dreams</em>, and <em>The Palace of Illusions</em>. Two of her novels have been made into movies. Her writings have appeared in more than 50 magazines, including <em>The Atlantic Monthly</em> and <em>The New Yorker</em>. She has also become a frequently sought-after op-ed and NPR commentator regarding how the West perceives Southeast Asia.In a soggy treatment of catastrophe and enlightenment, Divakaruni (<i>The Mistress of Spices</i>) traps a group of nine diverse people in the basement of an Indian consulate in an unidentified American city after an earthquake. Two are �migr�s who work for the consulate; the others are in the building to apply for visas. With very little food, rising flood water, dwindling oxygen, and no electricity or phone service, the victims fend off panic by taking turns at sharing the central stories of their lives. Oddly, the group spends little time brainstorming ways to escape, even when they run out of food and water, and sections of ceiling collapse around them. They wait in fatalistic resignation and tell their tales. Some are fable-like, with captivating scene-setting and rush-to-moral conclusions, but the most powerful are intimate, such as the revelations an accountant shares about his impoverished childhood with an exhausted mother, her boyfriend, and a beloved kitten. Despite moments of brilliance, this uneven novel, while vigorously plumbing themes of class struggle, disillusionment, and guilt, disappoints with careless and unearned epiphanies. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Duck and Goose simultaneously discover a giant polka-dotted sphere, which they take to be a very large egg: "I saw it first," says Duck; "I touched it first," says Goose. They spend hours sharing space on the egg's summit to keep it warm, first grudgingly, then companionably as they bond over their shared purpose. When a passerby points out that their prized egg is actually a child's toy ball, Duck and Goose decide the ball is lovely, too--just right for playing with together. Hills might have found ways to introduce more variety into his compositions, even given the somewhat limited situation, but the fresh, vivid colors draw the eye, and his whimsically rendered Duck and Goose (think bath toys with expressive eyebrows) will instantly endear themselves to children.

Many important things need to be done to prepare the earth for the Savior s Second Coming. From preaching the gospel in every nation, to sealing our families throughout the generations, to becoming ever more like our Savior, Jesus Christ, we as Latterday Saints face many tasks that may seem impossible from a worldly standpoint. But ours is an eternal perspective, and our mandate comes not from the world but from the Lord, who gives no commandment without preparing a way for it to be accomplished (see 1 Nephi 3:7). In fact, as Elder Russell M. Nelson points out, His pattern is one of using the unlikely to accomplish the impossible. From David and Goliath to Moses to Joseph Smith, the history of His people is a story of accomplishing the impossible. We too can become a part of this grand pattern as we strive to learn and do His will. This insightful book explores some of the means God gives us such as angelic help, prayer, and gifts of the Spirit to help us accomplish the impossible. It then shows what we can do to take our place in fulfilling the destiny He has planned for us. As we become partners with the Lord, impossible things really can become a reality!</p><p>Russell M.

The dog is a Labrador-Newfoundland mix. Tom says he looks like a Labrador with a bad perm. He wanted to name the dog "Put Your Shirt On" (please don't ask why), but he was outvoted by his family. The dog's name is Shadow. Early in his career Tom worked in politics, including a stint as the chief speechwriter for the governor of Ohio. This experience helped him develop the unique, storytelling narrative style of the Stick Dog books. More important, Tom's time in politics made him realize a very important thing: Kids are way smarter than adults.

Discover the wonder-working power of the blood for yourself!<b>H. A. Maxwell Whyte</b> (1908&#x2013;1988) embarked on a journey in ministry that was fraught with uncertainty and an absence of familiar landmarks when he was sovereignly led by the Holy Spirit into an understanding of demonic activity and spiritual warfare. As is often the case with pioneers, he was misunderstood, ridiculed, and ostracized by the Christian community, even in his own city of Toronto. Despite great opposition, he forged ahead in the battle against the forces of Satan, convinced that the ministry of deliverance was scripturally based and was being restored to the church in his day. Later, he began to record his experiences, and over the next two and a half decades, he authored eighteen books. His first book, <i>The Power of the Blood</i>, has been translated into several languages and is widely distributed throughout the world, selling over half a million copies internationally.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>In This Grave Hour: A Maisie Dobbs Novel (Maisie Dobbs, 13)</h2><p><p><strong>"A female investigator every bit as brainy and battle-hardened as Lisbeth Salander."&nbsp;</strong><strong>&#x2014;</strong><strong> Maureen Corrigan, NPR's <em>Fresh Air</em>, on Maisie Dobbs</strong></p><p>Sunday September 3rd 1939.&nbsp; At the moment Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain broadcasts to the nation Britain&#x2019;s declaration of war with Germany, a senior Secret Service agent breaks into Maisie Dobbs' flat to await her return.

It shows you how to grow your tea from seeds, cuttings, or small plants, as well as which parts of the plant are used to make tea. Liversidge lays out when and how to harvest your plants, as well as information on how to prepare the plant, including how to dry tea leaves to make tea you can store to last you throughout the year. As a guide to using tea to make you feel better, there are nutritional and medicinal benefits. Finally, there is an illustrated guide to show how to make up fresh and dried teabags and how to serve a delicious homegrown tea. It is sustainable way to look at a beverage, which is steeped in history and tradition.</p><p>Sample drinks include well-known plants such as rose hips, mint, sage, hibiscus, and lavender, as well as more obscure ones like chicory, angelica, apple geranium, and lemon verbena.</p></p><p><p>CASSIE LIVERSIDGE was born in the UK and studied Fine Art at Plymouth University. She grew up on her parent's plant nursery where her love of gardening began. Her debut book, <i>Grow Your Own Pasta Sauce</i> came from a desire to share her passion for eating home grown food and living in a more sustainable way. She lives and works in London with her husband and two sons, but spends two months of the year in New York.</p>Tea is the new coffee. When such global shops as Starbucks drink up smaller tea concerns and when national &#x201c;drink me&#x201d; retailers appear in neighborhoods, then Londoner Liversidge (author of Pasta Sauce! Grow Your Own Ingredients, 2013) is right on trend. Her book acts as a reference tool primarily for those harvesting from seed or plant, although, obviously, anyone tea inclined will find it useful. She covers leaves, seeds, fruits, flowers, and roots&#x2014;43, in total&#x2014;with such information as reaping medicinal and nutritional benefits, growing, harvesting, and preparing the brew. Although the format is somewhat repetitious, and the photographs are not the sharpest, her wisdom is demonstrated on every page. For instance, sidebars called &#x201c;Teabag Friends&#x201d; and &#x201c;Tips&#x201d; respectively identify complementary tea tastes and alternative uses (as well as occasional caveats, like don&#x2019;t confuse African violets with violets). Both the book&#x2019;s introduction and its finale are well filled with facts, ranging from notes about teapots and water to advice on plant gardening and tea drying. --Barbara Jacobs</p><h2>The Wizard&#39;s Wand (Geronimo Stilton and the Kingdom of Fantasy #9)</h2><p>I, Geronimo Stilton, was called to the Kingdom of Fantasy for the ninth time!

While countless websites now suggest ways to identify their offerings, few of those address the analytical needs of a researcher concerned with the nature and provenance of web material, whose numerous incarnations and transformations often affect the reliability of their content.<br><br>In the two years since the Third Edition was published, changes at major repositories and online information providers--as well as the ever-evolving electronic world--have generated new citation and analysis challenges for researchers. As a consequence, Mrs. Mills has once again revised her citation models and added descriptions and evaluations of numerous contemporary materials not included in the original Third Edition.<br><br>Here are the major changes you will find in this revised Third Edition:</p><ul>&lt;<li>Changes to about 75 pages in the text and index</li><br><li>New citations for the National Archives (NARA) website and manner of identifying documents</li><br> <li>Updates for citing DAR's revamped website and databases</li><br> <li>Alterations in citations for the DAR website and database</li><br> <li>Immigration citations reflecting changed records at the Ellis Island website</li></ul><p></p>&gt;</p><p>A popular lecturer and past president of both the American Society of Genealogists and the Board for Certification of Genealogists, Elizabeth Shown Mills is the author, editor, and translator of 13 books and over 500 articles in the fields of genealogy, history, literature, and sociology.

She has given researchers, writers, editors, and publishers invaluable new tools to bring quality and consistency to their work and distinction to the field." --National Genealogical Society Quarterly<br><br>The latest revision of this style manual, meant specifically for historical research and family genealogy work, builds upon the previous editions by adding new citation models, updates to websites, and information on new materials. There are more than 1,000 citation models covering print, microfilm and microfiche, websites, digital books and journals, DVDs, CDs, podcasts, and more. The glossary and bibliography have also been expanded. Libraries owning a previous edition will want to update; those where historical research - particularly genealogy-is important will want to acquire it as well. --Rebecca Vnuk, Booklist, Sept. 1, 2017</p><h2>Barefoot Books The Gigantic Turnip</h2><p>This hilarious retelling of the classic Russian tale about a farmer whose turnip is impossible to pull from the ground uses simple vocabulary and is ideal for reading aloud. Its cumulative theme will soon have young readers gleefully joining in, and Irish artist Niamh Sharkey s wonderfully quirky illustrations will delight and fascinate all ages.</p><p>Aleksei Tolstoy (1883-1945) was born and lived in Russia. During his four-decade literary career, he witnessed milestone historic events, both in his home country of Russia and abroad. He was a master storyteller, and wrote several children&#39;s tales as well as poems, plays and stories for adults. Niamh Sharkey, an award-winning Irish illustrator, graduated from the College of Marketing and Design, Ireland, in 1994 with First Class Honours. She works in oils on a gessoed textured background to create the richness in colour that has already established her as a world class illustrator. Niamh has illustrated a number of best-selling titles at Barefoot Books: Tales from Old Ireland + CD (1-905236-03-4), The Gigantic Turnip + CD (1-902283-29-5) and Tales of Wisdom and Wonder (1-84148-191-2).Even with the familiarity of this beloved tale, the anticipation of the story's outcome brings much pleasure. When September rolls around, just which of the assorted farm animals will make a difference as the farmer and his wife toil to extract an enormous turnip from the garden patch? Ellen Verenieks provides just enough personality to differentiate the two main characters. More importantly, she maintains a leisurely pace, which is perfect to help young listeners focus on the action, appreciate the repetition and humor of the unfolding harvest event, and enjoy the tension of the story's climax. Sigh deeply, relax, and enjoy this fine serving of turnip stew.

Jung and gain insight into why others behave the way they do, and why you are the person you are.</b>&nbsp;<br><br>What&#x2019;s your type?<br><br> Would you rather . . . <br> . . . celebrate with the whole crowd or just a few friends?<br> . . . focus on the facts or get an overall impression?<br> . . . go with what &#x201c;seems logical&#x201d; or what &#x201c;feels fair&#x201d;?<br> . . . keep to a schedule or keep your options open?<br> &nbsp;<br> How you answer these questions is the very beginning of understanding who you are and how you relate to those around you, by using a new and exciting method called Typewatching. Otto Kroeger and Janet M. Thuesen have developed Typewatching from the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, which was derived from the work of C. G. Jung. Now they have put together the first and only popular guide to the MBTI in <i>Type Talk</i>. Here is a one-of-a-kind guide that describes this scientifically validated approach to &#x201c;name-calling,&#x201d; a method that has been used for more than forty years by individuals, families, corporations, and governments who want to communicate better.<br><br> Typewatching as explained in <i>Type Talk</i> is easy to learn and natural to use. With even moderate practice it can help teachers teach and students learn, workers work and bosses boss. It can help lovers love, parents parent, and everyone accept themselves and others more easily. Best of all, Typewatching is fun.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Type Talk</i> examines the four pairs of preferences that are fundamental to every personality type: Extraversion/Introversion, Sensing/iNtuition, Thinking/Feeling, and Judging/Perceiving. Kroeger and Thuesen provide a self-evaluation that can be used to determine which of each of these preferences best describes you. They delineate every combination of preferences&#x2014;there are 16 different personality types, so you are sure to find yourself&#x2014;and they go on to demonstrate how to analyze and evaluate other people as well. Once armed with this knowledge, you will learn how to thrive in a world of so many different types. Here is a celebration of the similarities and differences in people, an odyssey of discovery in which the final destination is success, satisfaction, and serenity.</p><p>Determine your personality using a scientifically validated method based on the work of C.G.

Sometimes this porcine heroine of Ian Falconer's Caldecott Honor Book, <i>Olivia</i>, is "plain," attired only in red briefs. Other times she is "fancy," with high-heeled dress-up shoes, lipstick, pearls, and a big red bow. Sometimes&#x2014;-when Olivia is running the circus, for example (<i>Olivia Saves the Circus</i>)--she is very "loud" with a lion, which renders the lion rather "quiet." Whether meeting this energetic and incorrigible piglet for the first or the 100th time, readers of all ages will be happy to watch Olivia do pretty much anything, even something as simple as counting (<i>Olivia Counts</i>) or teaching about opposites. This sturdy little board book, with lots of white space and black-and-white illustrations, splashed with occasional red, is a perfect introduction to the concepts of opposites, from "up" and "down" to the "open" and "closed" mouth of our yawning, pajama'd pig at the conclusion.

How could you not? It was the day we came and you left, but I don&#x2019;t want to be sad today. I want to be happy and tell you everything. I&#x2019;ll start at the beginning. You probably already know what I&#x2019;m telling you, but maybe you don&#x2019;t. Maybe you haven&#x2019;t been watching.</p><p>I like turning twelve so much already. It&#x2019;s the biggest number I&#x2019;ve ever been, but it&#x2019;s an easy number&#x2014;easy to say, easy to count, easy to split in half. I wonder if Amil thinks about you on this day like I do. I wonder if he likes being twelve?</p><p>We woke up at a little before seven. Amil and I usually sleep through our birth minutes and then when we wake up, we stand next to the last mark we etched into the wall with a sharp rock. No one else knows it&#x2019;s there. I do it for Amil and he does mine and then we compare how much we&#x2019;ve grown since last year. Amil has finally caught up with me. Papa says someday Amil will tower over all of us. That&#x2019;s hard to imagine.</p><p>Papa gave me your gold chain with a small ruby stone hanging from it. He started giving me the jewelry when I was seven. Now I have two gold bangles, two gold rings, small emerald-and-gold hoop earrings, and the ruby necklace. Papa said I should save the jewelry for special occasions, but lately there are none, so I wear all the jewelry at once and never take it off. I don&#x2019;t know where he keeps all of it, but each year on my birthday, another piece appears at my bedside in a dark blue velvet box with gold trim. When you open it, the blue satin lining winks back at you. Papa always asks for the box back after I take out the jewelry.</p><p>Secretly, I want the box more than the jewelry. I want it to be all mine and never have to give it back. I could find any old thing&#x2014;a pebble, a leaf, a pistachio shell&#x2014;and put it in the box. Like magic, these things would get to be special at least for a day. Maybe he&#x2019;ll let me have it when your jewelry runs out.</p><p>I want to tell you about this diary I&#x2019;m writing in. Kazi gave it to me this morning wrapped in brown paper, tied with a piece of dried grass. He never gives me gifts on my birthday. I once read an English story where a little girl got a big pink cake and presents wrapped in shiny paper and bows for her birthday. I thought about the little gifts Kazi gives us all the time&#x2014;pieces of candy under our pillows or a ripe tomato from the garden, sliced, salted, and sprinkled with chili pepper on a plate. Cake and bows must be nice, but is anything better than a perfect tomato?</p><p>The diary is covered in purple and red silk, decorated with small sequins and bits of mirrored glass sewn in. The paper is rough, thick, and the color of butter. It is not lined, which I like. I&#x2019;ve never had a diary before. When Kazi gave it to me, he said it was time to start writing things down, and that I was the one to do it. He said someone needs to make a record of the things that will happen because the grown-ups will be too busy. I&#x2019;m not sure what he thinks is going to happen, but I&#x2019;ve decided I&#x2019;m going to write in it every day if I can. I want to explain things to you as if I&#x2019;m writing a storybook, like <i>The Jungle Book </i>except without all the animals. I want to make it real so you can imagine it. I want to remember what everyone says and does, and I won&#x2019;t know the ending until I get there.</p><p>Kazi also gave Amil five charcoal drawing pencils. Five! He also made us rice kheer with our pooris. I&#x2019;m not sure there is anything better tasting in the world. Amil, who normally eats too fast, makes his pudding last extra long, eating the smallest bites he can. I think he just does it so I have to watch him long after I&#x2019;ve finished. Every so often he&#x2019;ll look up and smile. I pretend I don&#x2019;t care. Sometimes he saves his sweets for me, but not rice kheer.</p><p>Today we were running late, though, and Amil couldn&#x2019;t spend forever eating his kheer because Dadi took our plates away and told us to get ready. Amil started grumbling about school and how he wished he was a grown-up and could work at the hospital like Papa instead. &#x201c;The drums sound better at a distance,&#x201d; Dadi said like she always does, and rushed us out the door.</p><p>Here&#x2019;s another secret, and don&#x2019;t be mad. Amil and I didn&#x2019;t go to school. We headed all the way out of town to the sugarcane field and tried to walk through it like a maze. We broke off pieces to chew. Later we stopped under a shady tree. Amil found bugs to draw and I read. After, we bought potato pakoras at the roadside cart in town, hoping no one would ask why we weren&#x2019;t in school. The pakoras tasted crisp and extra salty. Amil thinks they&#x2019;re too salty, but I like the sting on my tongue that stays long after I&#x2019;ve finished eating.</p><p>Amil would rather draw and play all day instead of going to school. He would rather do anything besides school. He draws very well. Did you know that? I don&#x2019;t hate school, but I didn&#x2019;t want Amil to be alone on our birthday. When Papa finds out we didn&#x2019;t go to school, he&#x2019;ll be much angrier at Amil than he will at me. That&#x2019;s how it is with Papa and Amil. It hasn&#x2019;t always been like that. Amil used to be Papa&#x2019;s favorite, I think because Amil was always louder, happier, and funnier than I am. But now because Amil isn&#x2019;t small and cute, Papa is different.</p><p>When we were about seven or eight, Amil ran away. That&#x2019;s when it started. Papa came home from a long day at the hospital and during dinner he told Amil to stop smiling so much, that it made him look ridiculous. This only made Amil smile more.</p><p>Then Papa said, &#x201c;Amil, you can&#x2019;t read. You play around too much and draw little pictures. You must be more serious or you will become nothing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe I should leave. Then you&#x2019;ll be happy,&#x201d; Amil said. He waited for Papa to say something, but Papa didn&#x2019;t. He just turned back to his food. Amil got up and walked straight out of the house. An hour went by and he didn&#x2019;t come back, so I went out to look for him. I looked everywhere, around the garden, the shed, Kazi&#x2019;s and Mahit&#x2019;s cottages, all the places he might go. I even looked in the pantry and in Papa&#x2019;s closet. Papa acted like nothing was happening, but I told Kazi that I couldn&#x2019;t find Amil anywhere and he told Dadi and Dadi told Papa, so Papa went out with a lantern. I stayed awake in my bed wondering what I would do if Amil never came back. I couldn&#x2019;t imagine being in this house, in this life, without him. I heard Papa return and I waited to hear Amil&#x2019;s voice or his footsteps, but I didn&#x2019;t hear anything and began to cry, holding my doll, Dee, tight. At some point I fell asleep. When I woke at first light, Amil slept soundly in his bed next to mine. I wasn&#x2019;t sure if I had dreamed the whole thing.</p><p>&#x201c;Amil,&#x201d; I said, poking him awake, standing over him. &#x201c;Where did you go? Does Papa know you&#x2019;re back?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Papa knows I&#x2019;m back,&#x201d; Amil said in a dull voice. &#x201c;I walked into town, but then I kept going. I didn&#x2019;t want to stop. But Papa found me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is Papa mad?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Papa will always be mad at me. It doesn&#x2019;t matter if I smile or don&#x2019;t smile. I&#x2019;m just not what he wanted.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not true,&#x201d; I said, and put my hand on his shoulder. He turned away. He might have been right about Papa, though. Since that night he ran away, Papa always seems angry at Amil for being Amil.</p><p>Papa left a book on Amil&#x2019;s bed this morning. Normally on our birthday he only gives me the jewelry and we do puja at our temple and offer the gods handfuls of leaves and sweets for a prosperous year, but Papa did not talk about it this morning. Maybe we will go tomorrow. Papa doesn&#x2019;t like to go to temple. We only go on our birthdays and Diwali because Dadi begs us to go. Sometimes Papa walks her there and waits outside for her. I always look forward to going. I drink in the smoky smell of the lamps burning. I even like the metal taste of the holy water on my tongue. The soft sounds of the prayers being chanted and sung make me feel loved, like you&#x2019;re there, watching. But maybe a Hindu temple is the last place you&#x2019;d be.</p><p>Amil&#x2019;s book is beautiful. It&#x2019;s a thick collection of tales from the Mahabharata with gold lettering on the cover and bright colorful pictures inside. Amil will love the drawings, but he won&#x2019;t read it. Amil says he can&#x2019;t read right because the words jump around and change on him. Papa thinks he&#x2019;s lying so he doesn&#x2019;t have to do his schoolwork. But I know he&#x2019;s not. I see the way he studies the writing, his eyes squinted, his face pinched. I see how hard he tries. He even turns the book upside down sometimes, but he says nothing helps. I think it&#x2019;s because Amil is a little bit magical. His eyes turn everything into art. Maybe Papa thought if he brought him a really good book, Amil would read it.</p><p>Papa didn&#x2019;t say anything about skipping school today. I hope our headmasters don&#x2019;t send a messenger with a note. Now I&#x2019;m tired and must drink my warm milk and go to bed. Amil is already sound asleep, making little whistling sounds through his nose. I&#x2019;ve decided that night is the best time to write to you. That way no one will ask me any questions.</p><p>Love, Nisha</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>***</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>July 15, 1947</p><p>Dear Mama,</p><p>I only have time to tell you one thing tonight because my eyelids are heavier than wet sheets. Papa is very mad. I knew he would be when he found out. Amil&#x2019;s headmaster sent over a message. Mine did not. When Papa found out, he made Amil sit in the corner with no breakfast this morning. Amil didn&#x2019;t ask why I wasn&#x2019;t being punished, even though Papa must have known I skipped, too. I guess the difference is that I do well in school and Amil doesn&#x2019;t. I only ate one of my chapatis and wrapped the other in a napkin. Then I stuck it in my schoolbook for Amil when no one was looking.</p><p>I think Kazi likes us best. Papa loves us of course because he&#x2019;s our father and Dadi loves us because she&#x2019;s our grandmother. That&#x2019;s what they&#x2019;re supposed to do, but Papa is too busy to do a lot of liking and Dadi is too old. Papa works every day, even on Sunday. I guess he has to since he&#x2019;s a doctor. People leave gifts on our doorstep all the time, like flowers and sweets for the wonderful things he has done for them. Sometimes I think Papa&#x2019;s not real. He leaves early with the cool morning air and never makes a sound. Sometimes when he comes back late at night and kisses me good night in my sleep, I wake up and see him. It feels like I&#x2019;m dreaming.</p><p>Love, Nisha</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>***</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>July 16, 1947</p><p>Dear Mama,</p><p>Kazi has so much energy for us. He always has. When we were younger, maybe five or six, he used to sit cross-legged on the floor and play with us after his work was done. I remember he was the first person to teach Amil how to play cricket in the front of the house, how to throw and bat and catch. Papa never did. I would peer out the window and watch them, laughing hard when Amil missed the ball, since he could hardly see me.</p><p>I help Kazi in the kitchen all the time, even though Dadi doesn&#x2019;t want me to. She says I&#x2019;ll marry well and have someone cook for me, just like Kazi does for us. But that doesn&#x2019;t sound like any fun at all. I can&#x2019;t wait to be older and do what Kazi can do. He lets me help him more all the time. I know how to sort the lentils, grind the spices with his marble mortar and pestle, clarify the butter for ghee, and mix the dough for chapatis. I usually finish my schoolwork fast and sneak into the kitchen, when Dadi thinks I&#x2019;m still working, to help Kazi prepare dinner. He sees me even when he&#x2019;s not looking up. It&#x2019;s like he smells me. He turns and holds up a handful of peas to be shelled. I like to cook things even more than I like to eat them. How does Kazi take all these plain boring foods&#x2014;bitter vegetables, dried lentils, flour, oil, spices&#x2014;and turn them into something so warm and delicious every time?</p><p>Love, Nisha</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>***</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>July 17, 1947</p><p>Dear Mama,</p><p>Kazi is right. I was made for writing in a diary. I&#x2019;d much rather write than talk. I talk very little, mostly just to Amil and Kazi. I feel normal around them. I talk to Dadi and Papa if I have to. But for the rest of the world, the words just don&#x2019;t want to come out, like part of my mouth or my brain is broken. It feels scary to talk, because once the words are out, you can&#x2019;t put them back in. But if you write words and they don&#x2019;t come out the way you want them to, you can erase them and start over. I have the neatest handwriting in my class and get the highest marks on all my compositions. You would be very proud of me.</p><p>Amil likes to talk. He likes to run. He likes to laugh. He likes to yell. But he hates writing anything down, except for his drawings. The teachers think he&#x2019;s stupid because he can&#x2019;t read and doesn&#x2019;t do his schoolwork, but they should look at his drawings. Amil draws all sorts of things. Sometimes he draws frightening scorpions and snakes with dark charcoal pencil. He draws every leg, every bump, every little detail. Sometimes he draws me early in the morning when I&#x2019;m still sleeping. It&#x2019;s strange to look at myself that way, but I like it. It makes me feel like I&#x2019;m not alone, like someone is always watching over me. Are you, Mama?</p><p>Sometimes Amil draws Dadi or Papa when they aren&#x2019;t looking and only shows me. He draws Kazi cooking. He likes to paste lots of paper scraps together with flour and water to make a bigger drawing space. Kazi once gave him a drawing pad. Amil only does his best work on the paper after he practices on his bits of flour bags, ends of newspaper, whatever he can find. He let me touch the drawing pad paper once. It&#x2019;s cloud white, silky smooth. I wonder why Amil is the way he is. I wonder why I am the way I am. I bet you know.</p><p>Love, Nisha</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>***</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>July 18, 1947</p><p>Dear Mama,</p><p>Something very strange happened today. Three men came to our house this afternoon. I don&#x2019;t know why they came. I was doing my homework. Amil tried to do his but mostly doodled. Dadi sat at the table writing letters. Papa was at the hospital. The men knocked on the door. One of them was a teacher at our school who always dyes his gray hair red. His beard is the color of a chili pepper. I didn&#x2019;t recognize the other two men. Dadi looked out the window and called Amil. Then she told us both to go into the kitchen with Kazi, so we did. Her eyes darted back and forth before she answered the door.</p><p>All three of us&#x2014;me, Kazi, and Amil&#x2014;peeked around the corner. The men spoke so quietly I couldn&#x2019;t hear them. Then they spoke louder. I heard bits and pieces of sentences, words and names I had been hearing Papa talk about to Dadi, seen in the headlines from their newspapers. I turned over the words like puzzle pieces in my head, wondering how they were supposed to fit together: <i>Pakistan, Jinnah, independence, Nehru, India, British, Lord Mountbatten, Gandhi, partition.</i></p><p>Dadi nodded and nodded, and the air smelled like the smoke from pipes. She tried to close the door once and one of the men, the tallest one, held the door open, not letting her. I held my breath. Then she finally closed the door and turned around. We came out from our hiding places, but she didn&#x2019;t say a thing. Her eyes were big, and she and Kazi kept giving each other secret looks. Amil asked what happened.</p><p>Dadi waved him away, but Amil didn&#x2019;t give ...</p></p><h2>Coping With Your Difficult Older Parent : A Guide for Stressed-Out Children</h2><p><strong>Do You Have<br> An Aging Parent Who</strong> --<p></p><ul><li>Blames you for everything that goes wrong?</li><li>Cannot tolerate being alone, wants you all the time?</li><li>Is obsessed with health problems, real, or imagined?</li><li>Make unreasonable and/or irrational demands of you?</li><li>Is hostile, negative and critical?</li></ul><p></p> <p>Coping with these traits in parents is an endless high-stress battle for their children.

Here twenty-one of the Bard&#x2019;s plays are refashioned into stories that are true to the wit, the humor, the wisdom, the sublime heights, the terrifying depths, and above all the poetry of their great originals. Throughout, Garfield skillfully weaves in Shakespeare&#x2019;s own words, accustoming young readers to language and lines that might at first seem forbiddingly unfamiliar. <i>Leon Garfield&#x2019;s Shakespeare Stories</i> is an essential distillation&#x2014;a truly Shakespearean tribute to Shakespeare&#x2019;s genius and a delight for children and parents alike.<br><br></p></p><p><p><b>Leon Garfield</b> (1921&#x2013;1996) was born and raised in the seaside town of Brighton, England. His father owned a series of businesses, and the family&#x2019;s fortunes fluctuated wildly. Garfield enrolled in art school, left to work in an office, and in 1940 was drafted into the army, serving in the medical corps. After the war, he returned to London and worked as a biochemical technician. In 1948 he married Vivian Alcock, an artist who would later become a successful writer of children&#x2019;s books, and it was she who encouraged him to write his first novel, <i>Jack Holborn</i>, which was published in 1964. In all, Garfield would write some fifty books, including a continuation of Charles Dickens&#x2019;s <i>Mystery of Edwin Drood</i> and retellings of biblical and Shakespearian stories. Among his best-known books are <i>Devil-in-the-Fog</i> (1966, winner of <i>The Guardian</i> Children&#x2019;s Fiction Prize), <i>Smith</i> (1967, published in The New York Review Children&#x2019;s Collection), <i>The God Beneath the Sea</i> (1970, winner of the Carnegie Medal), and <i>John Diamond</i> (1980, winner of the Whitbread Award).<br><br> <b>Michael Foreman</b> has illustrated more than one hundred books, including those for stories by J.M. Barrie, the Brothers Grimm, Charles Dickens, and Oscar Wilde. His most recent work includes <i>The Seeds of Friendship</i>, which he wrote and illustrated, and the illustrations for Michael Morpurgo&#x2019;s retellings of <i>Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</i> and <i>Beowulf.</i><br><br><i><br></i></p>"In these lively and evocative pages a child will hear Shakespeare&#x2019;s poetry set in prose that will lay the groundwork for many a future enchanted evening at the theater.&#x201d; &#x2013;Meghan Cox Gurdon,&nbsp;<i>The Wall Street Journal</i><br><br>"Leon Garfield&#x2019;s performance in <i>Shakespeare Stories</i> is masterly. <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>, <i>The Taming of the Shrew</i>, <i>Twelfth Night</i>, and <i>A Midsummer Night&#x2019;s Dream</i> best reveal the virtuosity Mr. Garfield has developed in many years of writing dozens of children&#x2019;s books and historical novels. In Mr. Garfield&#x2019;s deft narratives the laughter is the same that one finds in the plays, but so is the uneasiness. He gets the balances right."&nbsp;&#x2014;D. J. R. Bruckner, <i>The New York Times</i><br><br>"Here is an alternative to yellow study guides, one in which explication is available in the graceful prose. Garfield&#x2019;s seamless movement between his own descriptive language and Shakespeare&#x2019;s has never worked better."&nbsp;&#x2014;Sally Margolis, <i>School Library Journal</i><br><br>"The most accessible introduction to the Bard ever."&nbsp;&#x2014;<i>Woman &amp; Home</i><br><br><i>&nbsp;</i></p><h2>Assassination Classroom, Vol. 6 (6)</h2><p>Ever caught yourself screaming, "I could just kill that teacher"? What would it take to justify such antisocial behavior and weeks of detention? Especially if he's the best teacher you've ever had? Giving you an "F" on a quiz? Mispronouncing your name during roll call...again? How about blowing up the moon and threatening to do the same to Mother Earth&#x2014;unless you take him out first?! Plus a reward of a cool 100 million from the Ministry of Defense! Okay, now that you're committed... How are you going to pull this off? What does your pathetic class of misfits have in their arsenal to combat Teach's alien technology, bizarre powers and...tentacles?!<br> <br>The 3-E students discover that Koro Sensei's greatest weakness might be a common substance. Will they be able to use it to assassinate him while he helps Meg, formerly of the varsity swim team, with her greatest weakness? The next assassination attempt, implemented by Terasaka, is more elaborate but endangers his fellow students. Can he save them without saving his target? Then, the top class at school, including Principal Asano's son, conspires to prevent 3-E from ever rising closer to the top!</p><p>Yusei Matsui was born on the last day of January in Saitama Prefecture, Japan.

Caleb Mozzocco, <i>School Library Journal: Good Comics for Kids</i><br><i></i><br><i></i>"One of the most fulfilling aspects of <i>Si�il</i> is this conveyance of comics as language, of words and pictures as unified text. ...

Starting in 1982 as a bad inker for Marvel Comics, he swiftly evolved into a not-so-bad artist. By the late 1980s, he had begun to develop his own unique graphic style, with mainstream projects like <i>Cosmic Odyssey</i> and <i>Batman: Gotham by Gaslight</i>. In 1994, he published the first <i>Hellboy</i> series through Dark Horse. There are thirteen <i>Hellboy</i> graphic novels (with more on the way), several spin-off titles (<i>B.P.R.D., Lobster Johnson, Abe Sapien, </i>and<i> Sir Edward Grey: Witchfinder</i>), prose books, animated films, and two live-action films starring Ron Perlman. Along the way he worked on Francis Ford Coppola's film <i>Bram Stoker's Dracula</i> (1992), was a production designer for Disney's<i> Atlantis: The Lost Empire</i> (2001), and was the visual consultant to director Guillermo del Toro on <i>Blade II</i> (2002), <i>Hellboy</i> (2004), and <i>Hellboy II: The Golden Army</i> (2008).

In 1906 the Swedish artist began painting her first abstract series, <i>Primordial Chaos</i>, featuring blue, green and yellow geometrical shapes and spirals. Her main work, <i>Paintings for the Temple</i>, expresses what she calls the higher truth: unity beyond duality and the material world and mankind&#x2019;s spiritual evolution. What was the zeitgeist that inspired such an eruption in art?

Why I didn&#x2019;t lock the damn door to begin with. Or why it didn&#x2019;t register that something was wrong&#x2014;so mercilessly wrong&#x2014;when I felt the mattress shift under his weight. Why I didn&#x2019;t scream when I opened my eyes and saw him crawling between my sheets. Or why I didn&#x2019;t try to fight him when I still stood a chance.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t know how long I lay there afterward, telling myself: Squeeze your eyelids shut, try, just try to forget. Try to ignore all the things that didn&#x2019;t feel right, all the things that felt like they would never feel right again. Ignore the taste in your mouth, the sticky dampness of the sheets, the fire radiating through your thighs, the nauseating pain&#x2014;this bulletlike thing that ripped through you and got lodged in your gut somehow. No, can&#x2019;t cry. Because there&#x2019;s nothing to cry about. Because it was just a dream, a bad dream&#x2014;a nightmare. Not real. Not real. Not real. That&#x2019;s what I keep thinking: NotRealNotRealNotReal. Repeat, repeat, repeat. Like a mantra. Like a prayer.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t know that these images flashing through my mind&#x2014;a movie of someone else, somewhere else&#x2014;will never really go away, will never ever stop playing, will never stop haunting me. I close my eyes again, but it&#x2019;s all I can see, all I can feel, all I can hear: his skin, his arms, his legs, his hands too strong, his breath on me, muscles stretching, bones cracking, body breaking, me getting weaker, fading. These things&#x2014;it&#x2019;s all there is.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t know how many hours pass before I awake to the usual Sunday morning clamor&#x2014;pots and pans clanging against the stove. Food smells seeping under my door&#x2014;bacon, pancakes, Mom&#x2019;s coffee. TV sounds&#x2014;cold fronts and storm systems moving through the area by midday&#x2014;Dad&#x2019;s weather channel. Dishwasher-running sounds. Yippy yappy dog across the street yips and yaps at probably nothing, as always. And then there&#x2019;s the almost imperceptible rhythm of a basketball bouncing against the dewy blacktop and the squeaky-sneaker shuffling of feet in the driveway. Our stupid, sleepy suburbia, like every other stupid, sleepy suburbia, awakens groggy, indifferent to its own inconsequence, collectively wishing for one more Saturday and dreading chores and church and to-do lists and Monday morning. Life just goes, just happens, continuing as always. Normal. And I can&#x2019;t shake the knowledge that life will just keep on happening, regardless if I wake up or not. Obscenely normal.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t know, as I force my eyes open, that the lies are already in motion. I try to swallow. But my throat&#x2019;s raw. Feels like strep, I tell myself. I must be sick, that&#x2019;s all. Must have a fever. I&#x2019;m delirious. Not thinking clearly. I touch my lips. They sting. And my tongue tastes blood. But no, it couldn&#x2019;t have been. Not real. So as I stare at the ceiling, I&#x2019;m thinking: I must have serious issues if I&#x2019;m dreaming stuff like that. Horrible stuff like that. About Kevin. Kevin. Because Kevin is my brother&#x2019;s best friend, practically my brother. My parents love him like everyone does, even me, and Kevin would never&#x2014;could never. Not possible. But then I try to move my legs to stand. They&#x2019;re so sore&#x2014;no, broken feeling. And my jaw aches like a mouthful of cavities.<br> <br>I close my eyes again. Take a deep breath. Reach down and touch my body. No underwear. I sit up too fast and my bones wail like I&#x2019;m an old person. I&#x2019;m scared to look. But there they are: my days-of-the-week underwear in a ball on the floor. They were my Tuesdays, even though it was Saturday, because, well, who would ever know anyway? That&#x2019;s what I was thinking when I put them on yesterday. And now I know, for sure, it happened. It actually happened. And this pain in the center of my body, the depths of my insides, restarts its torture as if on cue. I throw the covers off. Kneecap-shaped bruises line my arms, my hips, my thighs. And the blood&#x2014;on the sheets, the comforter, my legs.<br> <br>But this was supposed to be an ordinary Sunday.<br> <br>I was supposed to get up, get dressed, and sit down to breakfast with my family. Then after breakfast, I would promptly go to my bedroom and finish any homework I hadn&#x2019;t finished Friday night, sure to pay special attention to geometry. I would practice that new song we learned in band, call my best friend, Mara, maybe go to her house later, and do dozens of other stupid, meaningless tasks.<br> <br>But that&#x2019;s not what&#x2019;s going to happen today, I know, as I sit in my bed, staring at my stained skin in disbelief, my hand shaking as I press it against my mouth.<br> <br>Two knocks on my bedroom door. I jump.<br> <br>&#x201c;Edy, you up?&#x201d; My mother&#x2019;s voice shouts. I open my mouth, but it feels like someone poured hydrochloric acid down my throat and I might never be able to speak again. Knock, knock, knock: &#x201c;Eden, breakfast!&#x201d; I quickly pull my nightgown down as far as it will go, but there&#x2019;s blood smeared on that, too.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mom?&#x201d; I finally call back, my voice scratchy and horrible.<br> <br>She cracks the door open. As she peers in her eyes immediately go to the blood. &#x201c;Oh God,&#x201d; she gasps, as she slips inside and quickly shuts the door behind her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mom, I&#x2014;&#x201d; But how am I supposed say the words, the worst words, the ones I know have to be spoken?<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, Edy.&#x201d; She sighs, turning her head at me with a sad smile. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Wh&#x2014;&#x201d; I start to say. How can it be okay, in what world is this okay?<br> <br>&#x201c;This happens sometimes when you&#x2019;re not expecting it.&#x201d; She flits around my room, tidying up, barely looking at me while she explains about periods and calendars and counting the days. &#x201c;It happens to everyone. That&#x2019;s why I told you, you need to keep track. That way you won&#x2019;t have to deal with these . . . surprises. You can be . . . prepared.&#x201d;<br> <br>This is what she thinks this is.<br> <br>Now, I&#x2019;ve seen enough TV movies to know you&#x2019;re supposed to tell. You&#x2019;re just supposed to fucking tell. &#x201c;But&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you hop in the shower, sweetie?&#x201d; she interrupts. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take care of this . . . uh . . . ,&#x201d; she begins, gesturing with her arm in a wide circle over my bed, searching for the word, &#x201c;this mess.&#x201d;<br> <br>This mess. Oh God, it&#x2019;s now or never. Now or never. It&#x2019;s now. &#x201c;Mom&#x2014;&#x201d; I try again.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be embarrassed,&#x201d; she says with a laugh. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s fine, really, I promise.&#x201d; She stands over me, looking taller than she ever has before, handing me my robe, oblivious of my Tuesday underwear crumpled at her feet.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mom, Kevin&#x2014;&#x201d; I start, but his name in my mouth makes me want to throw up.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, Edy. He&#x2019;s out back with your brother. They&#x2019;re playing basketball. And your father&#x2019;s glued to the TV, as usual. Nobody&#x2019;ll see you. Go ahead. Put this on.&#x201d;<br> <br>Looking up at her, I feel so small. And Kevin&#x2019;s voice moves like a tornado through my mind, whispering&#x2014;his breath on my face&#x2014;No one will ever believe you. You know that. No one. Not ever.<br> <br>Then my mom shakes the robe at me, offering me a lie I didn&#x2019;t even need to think up. She starts getting that look in her eye&#x2014;that impatient, it&#x2019;s-the-holidays-and-I-don&#x2019;t-have-time-for-this look. Clearly, it was time for me to get going so she could deal with this mess. And clearly, nobody was going to hear me. Nobody was going to see me&#x2014;he knew that. He had been around long enough to know how things work here.<br> <br>I try to stand without looking like everything is broken. I kick the Tuesdays under the bed so she won&#x2019;t find them and wonder. I take my robe. Take the lie. And as I look back at my mother, watching her collect the soiled sheets in her arms&#x2014;the evidence&#x2014;I know somehow if it&#x2019;s not now, it has to be never. Because he was right, no one would ever believe me. Of course they wouldn&#x2019;t. Not ever.<br> <br><br> <br>In the bathroom, I carefully peel off my nightgown, holding it at arm&#x2019;s length as I ball it up and stuff it in the garbage can under the sink. I adjust my glasses and examine myself more closely. There are a few faint marks on my throat in the shape of his fingers. But they&#x2019;re minor, really, in comparison to the ones on my body. No bruises on my face. Only the two-inch scar above my left eye from my bike accident two summers ago. My hair is slightly more disastrous than usual, but essentially I look the same&#x2014;I can pass.<br> <br>By the time I get out of the shower&#x2014;still dirty, after scrubbing my body raw, thinking I could maybe wash the bruises off&#x2014;there he is. Sitting at my kitchen table in my dining room with my brother, my father, my mother, sipping my orange juice from my glass&#x2014;his mouth on a glass I would have to use someday. On a fork that would soon be undifferentiated from all the other forks. His fingerprints not only all over every inch of me, but all over everything: this house, my life, the world&#x2014;infected with him.<br> <br>Caelin raises his head and narrows his eyes at me as I cautiously approach the dining room. He can see it. I knew he would see it right away. If anyone was going to notice&#x2014;if I could count on anyone&#x2014;it would be my big brother. &#x201c;Okay, you&#x2019;re being really weird and intense right now,&#x201d; he announces. He could tell because he always knew me even better than I knew myself.<br> <br>So I stand there and wait for him to do something about this. For him to set his fork down, stand up and pull me aside, take me out to the backyard by the arm, and demand to know what&#x2019;s wrong with me, demand to know what happened. Then I&#x2019;d tell him what Kevin did to me and he&#x2019;d give me one of his big brother-isms, like, Don&#x2019;t worry, Edy, I&#x2019;ll take care of it. The way he did whenever anyone was picking on me. And then he&#x2019;d run back inside the house and stab Kevin to death with his own butter knife.<br> <br>But that&#x2019;s not what happens.<br> <br>What happens is he just sits there. Watching me. Then slowly his mouth contorts into one of his smirks&#x2014;our inside-joke grin&#x2014;waiting for me to reciprocate, to give him a sign, or just start laughing like maybe I&#x2019;m trying to secretly make fun of our parents. He&#x2019;s waiting to get it. But he doesn&#x2019;t get it. So he just shrugs, looks back down at his plate, and lops off a big slice of pancake. The bullet lodges itself a little deeper in my stomach as I stand there, frozen in the hallway.<br> <br>&#x201c;Seriously, what are you staring at?&#x201d; he mumbles with his mouth full of pancake, in that familiar brotherly, you&#x2019;re-the-stupidest-person-on-the-face-of-the-earth tone he had perfected over the years.<br> <br>Meanwhile, Kevin barely even glances up. No threatening looks. No gestures of warning, nothing. As if nothing had even happened. The same cool disregard he always used with me. Like I&#x2019;m still just Caelin&#x2019;s dorky little sister with bad hair and freckles, freshman band-geek nobody, tagging along behind them, clarinet case in tow. But I&#x2019;m not her anymore. I don&#x2019;t even want to be her anymore. That girl who was so naive and stupid&#x2014;the kind of girl who could let something like this happen to her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on, Minnie,&#x201d; Dad says to me, using my pet name. Minnie as in Mouse, because I was so quiet. He gestured at the food on the table. &#x201c;Sit down. Everything&#x2019;s getting cold.&#x201d;<br> <br>As I stand in front of them&#x2014;their Mousegirl&#x2014;crooked glasses sliding down the bridge of my nose, stripped before eight scrutinizing eyes waiting for me to play my part, I finally realize what it&#x2019;s all been about. The previous fourteen years had merely been dress rehearsal, preparation for knowing how to properly shut up now. And Kevin had told me, with his lips almost touching mine he whispered the words: You&#x2019;re gonna keep your mouth shut. Last night it was an order, a command, but today it&#x2019;s just the truth.<br> <br>I push my glasses up. And with a sickness in my stomach&#x2014;something like stage fright&#x2014;I move slowly, cautiously. Try to act like every part of my body, inside and out, isn&#x2019;t throbbing and pulsing. I sit down in the seat next to Kevin like I had at countless family meals. Because we considered him part of our family, Mom was always saying it, over and over. He was always welcome.

The first of these stories traces Okonkwo's fall from grace with the tribal world in which he lives, and in its classical purity of line and economical beauty it provides us with a powerful fable about the immemorial conflict between the individual and society. The second story, which is as modern as the first is ancient, and which elevates the book to a tragic plane, concerns the clash of cultures and the destruction of Okonkwo's world through the arrival of aggressive, proselytizing European missionaries. These twin dramas are perfectly harmonized, and they are modulated by an awareness capable of encompassing at once the life of nature, human history, and the mysterious compulsions of the soul. THINGS FALL APART is the most illuminating and permanent monument we have to the modern African experience as seen from within.</p><p>One of the most widely read novels from Nigeria's most famous novelist. <b>Things Fall Apart</b> is a gripping study of the problem of European colonialism in Africa. The story relates the cultural collision that occurs when Christian English missionaries arrive among the Ibos of Nigeria, bringing along their European ways of life and religion. In the novel, the Nigerian Okonkwo recognizes the cultural imperialism of the white men and tries to show his own people how their own society will fall apart if they exchange their own cultural core for that of the English.This is Chinua Achebe&#39;s classic novel, with more than two million copies sold since its first U.S. publication in 1969. Combining a richly African story with the author&#39;s keen awareness of the qualities common to all humanity, Achebe here shows that he is &#34;gloriously gifted, with the magic of an ebullient, generous, great talent.&#34; -- Nadine Gordimer</p><h2>Billy Showell&#39;s Botanical Painting in Watercolour</h2><p>Billy Showell is a well-respected botanical watercolour artist, and her exceptional eye for detail and ability to re-create the form, texture, colour and patterning of a wide range of plants have earned her a formidable reputation worldwide.

This ode to the male physique celebrates the evolving, at one time illicit, art form from anonymous 19th century erotica through to contemporary work from David Hockney and Duane Michaels.</p><p>Through the classic, the playful, and the provocative, it explores the compositions, postures, and role-playing of this often under-explored genre. Esteemed masters such as Herbert List, George Platt Lynes or Robert Mapplethorpe are all there, alongside Baron Wilhelm von Gloeden, famed for his homoerotic images of nude youths in classical postures in Sicily. Further highlights include illustrations from Physique Pictorial, the leading organ of the mid-50s gay scene and a pioneer in gay publishing.</p></p><p>The male form has made strides to reclaim its place in modern society, along side its female counterpart, as a thing of beauty, admiration, and desire. Yet even as we begin a new century, controversy, fear, and discomfort keep it from realizing its full potential as a popularly accepted object d&#39;art. In The Nude Male, David Leddick has assembled the latest and most current survey of the male nude form, as seen through the eyes of today&#39;s most important and influential artists who recognize the inherent physical and emotional beauty of the subject. The Nude Male features the work of more than 120 established and emerging photographers and illustrators. This collection of more than 250 images, ranging from erotic to funny, from thought-provoking to mind-bending, from breathtaking to breathless. is nothing less than the premiere catalogue of the genre.David Leddick has been an officer in the US army, a dancer with the Metropolitan Opera in New York and creative director of leading cosmetics brands.

But how to unpack the grief that follows such a painful, and often stigmatized, death? Ron Rolheiser can help.</i><br><br> When someone is stricken with cancer, one of three things can happen: Doctors treat the disease and cure it; professionals can&#x2019;t cure the disease but can control it so that the person suffering can live with the disease for the rest of his or her life; or the cancer can be of a kind that cannot be treated and all the medicine and treatments in the world are powerless &#x2013; the person dies.</p><p>Emotional depression leading to suicide can work the same way. Sometimes a person can be treated so that, in effect, they are cured; sometimes they can&#x2019;t ever really be cured, but can be treated in a way that they can live with the disease for their whole life; and sometimes,&nbsp;just as with certain kinds of cancer, the disease is untreatable, unstoppable, and no intervention by anyone or anything can halt its advance &#x2013; it eventually kills the person and there is nothing anyone can do.

In fact, there were so few public acknowledgments of the female presence that I felt personally honored whenever nature and large ships were referred to as feminine. But as I matured, I began to resent being considered a sister to a changeling as fickle as luck, as aloof as an ocean, and as frivolous as nature.<br> &nbsp;<br> The phrase &#x201c;A woman always has the right to change her mind&#x201d; played so aptly into the negative image of the female that I made myself a victim to an unwavering decision. Even if I made an inane and stupid choice, I stuck by it rather than &#x201c;be like a woman and change my mind.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Being a woman is hard work. Not without joy and even ecstasy, but still relentless, unending work. Becoming an old female may require only being born with certain genitalia, inheriting long-living genes and the fortune not to be run over by an out-of-control truck, but to become and remain a woman command the existence and employment of genius.<br> &nbsp;<br> The woman who survives intact and happy must be at once tender and tough. She must have convinced herself, or be in the unending process of convincing herself, that she, her values, and her choices are important. In a time and world where males hold sway and control, the pressure upon women to yield their rights-of-way is tremendous. And it is under those very circumstances that the woman&#x2019;s toughness must be in evidence.<br> &nbsp;<br> She must resist considering herself a lesser version of her male counterpart. She is not a sculptress, poetess, authoress, Jewess, Negress, or even (now rare) in university parlance a rectoress. If she is the thing, then for her own sense of self and for the education of the ill-informed she must insist with rectitude in being the thing and in being called the thing.<br> &nbsp;<br> A rose by any other name may smell as sweet, but a woman called by a devaluing name will only be weakened by the misnomer.<br> &nbsp;<br> She will need to prize her tenderness and be able to display it at appropriate times in order to prevent toughness from gaining total authority and to avoid becoming a mirror image of those men who value power above life, and control over love.<br> &nbsp;<br> It is imperative that a woman keep her sense of humor intact and at the ready. She must see, even if only in secret, that she is the funniest, looniest woman in her world, which she should also see as being the most absurd world of all times.<br> &nbsp;<br> It has been said that laughter is therapeutic and amiability lengthens the life span.<br> &nbsp;<br> Women should be tough, tender, laugh as much as possible, and live long lives. The struggle for equality continues unabated, and the woman warrior who is armed with wit and courage will be among the first to celebrate victory.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Passports to Understanding<br> &nbsp;<br> Human beings are more alike than unalike, and what is true anywhere is true everywhere, yet I encourage travel to as many destinations as possible for the sake of education as well as pleasure.<br> &nbsp;<br> It is necessary, especially for Americans, to see other lands and experience other cultures. The American, living in this vast country and able to traverse three thousand miles east to west using the same language, needs to hear languages as they collide in Europe, Africa, and Asia.<br> &nbsp;<br> A tourist, browsing in a Paris shop, eating in an Italian ristorante, or idling along a Hong Kong street, will encounter three or four languages as she negotiates the buying of a blouse, the paying of a check, or the choosing of a trinket. I do not mean to suggest that simply overhearing a foreign tongue adds to one&#x2019;s understanding of that language. I do know, however, that being exposed to the existence of other languages increases the perception that the world is populated by people who not only speak differently from oneself but whose cultures and philosophies are other than one&#x2019;s own.<br> &nbsp;<br> Perhaps travel cannot prevent bigotry, but by demonstrating that all peoples cry, laugh, eat, worry, and die, it can introduce the idea that if we try to understand each other, we may even become friends.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The Sweetness of Charity<br> &nbsp;<br> The New Testament informs the reader that it is more blessed to give than to receive. I have found that among its other benefits, giving liberates the soul of the giver. The size and substance of the gift should be important to the recipient, but not to the donor save that the best thing one can give is that which is appreciated. The giver is as enriched as is the recipient, and more important, that intangible but very real psychic force of good in the world is increased.<br> &nbsp;<br> When we cast our bread upon the waters, we can presume that someone downstream whose face we will never know will benefit from our action, as we who are downstream from another will profit from that grantor&#x2019;s gift.<br> &nbsp;<br> Since time is the one immaterial object which we cannot influence&#x2014;neither speed up nor slow down, add to nor diminish&#x2014;it is an imponderably valuable gift. Each of us has a few minutes a day or a few hours a week which we could donate to an old folks&#x2019; home or a children&#x2019;s hospital ward. The elderly whose pillows we plump or whose water pitchers we refill may or may not thank us for our gift, but the gift is upholding the foundation of the universe. The children to whom we read simple stories may or may not show gratitude, but each boon we give strengthens the pillars of the world.<br> &nbsp;<br> While our gifts and the recipients should be considered, our bounty, once decided upon, should be without concern, overflowing one minute and forgotten the next.<br> &nbsp;<br> Recently I was asked to speak before a group of philanthropists and was astonished at their self-consciousness. The gathered donors give tens of millions of dollars annually to medical research, educational development, art support, and social reform. Yet to a person they seemed a little, just a little, ashamed of themselves. I pondered their behavior and realized that someone had told someone that not only was it degrading to accept charity but it was equally debasing to give it. And sad to say, someone had believed that statement. Hence, many preferred to have it known that they dispense philanthropy rather than charity.<br> &nbsp;<br> I like charitable people and like to think of myself as charitable, as being of a generous heart and a giving nature&#x2014;of being a friend indeed to anyone in need. Why, I pondered, did the benefactors not feel as I?<br> &nbsp;<br> Some benefactors may desire distance from the recipients of their largess because there is a separation between themselves and the resources they distribute. As inheritors or managers of fortune rather than direct earners, perhaps they feel exiled from the gifts; then it follows that they feel exiled from the recipient.<br> &nbsp;<br> It is sad when people who give to the needy feel estranged from the objects of their generosity. They can take little, if any, relish from their acts of charity; therefore, are generous out of duty rather than delight.<br> &nbsp;<br> If we change the way we think of charity, our personal lives will be richer and the larger world will be improved. When we give cheerfully and accept gratefully, everyone is blessed. &#x201c;Charity&nbsp;...&nbsp;is kind;...&nbsp;envieth not;...&nbsp;vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>A Museum of Early American Tools (Americana)</h2><p>This absorbing and profusely illustrated book describes in detail scores of early American tools and the wooden and metal artifacts made with them.

His lifetime batting average is still the highest in history, and when he retired in 1928, after twenty-one years with the Detroit Tigers and two with the Philadelphia Athletics, he held more than ninety records. But the numbers don&#x2019;t tell half of Cobb&#x2019;s tale. The Georgia Peach was by far the most thrilling player of the era: When the Hall of Fame began in 1936, he was the first player voted in.<br> <br>But Cobb was also one of the game&#x2019;s most controversial characters. He got in a lot of fights, on and off the field, and was often accused of being overly aggressive. Even his supporters acknowledged that he was a fierce competitor, but he was also widely admired. After his death in 1961, however, his reputation morphed into that of a virulent racist who also hated children and women, and was in turn hated by his peers.<br> <br>How did this happen? Who is the real Ty Cobb? Setting the record straight, Charles Leerhsen pushed aside the myths, traveled to Georgia and Detroit, and re-traced Cobb&#x2019;s journey from the shy son of a professor and state senator who was progressive on race for his time to America&#x2019;s first true sports celebrity. The result is a &#x201c;noble [and] convincing&#x201d; (<i>The New York Times Book Review)</i> biography that is &#x201c;groundbreaking, thorough, and compelling...The most complete, well-researched, and thorough treatment that has ever been written&#x201d; (<i>The Tampa Tribune</i>).</p><p>Charles Leerhsen&nbsp;is a former executive editor at <i>Sports Illustrated</i>.

Meant to resemble a battle wound incurred at a moment of gridiron glory, it looked, alas, more like the fever chart for a failing business concern: cosmetology as practiced by a twenty-four-year-old, heterosexual Detroit Tiger. Next came the burnt cork. Black maintained a prominent place on the theatrical palette in 1911&#x2014;Cobb himself had several times been called on stage to receive the semiofficial &#x201c;Champion Batsman of the World&#x201d; trophy from a minstrel dressed in full darkie regalia&#x2014;but now he required just a smidgen, for the right side of his chin, a fake scuff to balance the bright greasepaint gash.<br> <br>&#x201c;My only problem,&#x201d; he said, leaning closer still to the looking glass and mussing his thinning strawberry blond curls, &#x201c;is that I ain&#x2019;t got any football hair.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Say, Ty, who taught you how to do that?&#x201d; said one of Cobb&#x2019;s two dressing room drop-bys that evening, Harry Matthews, a squat, cigar-chomping ex-minor-league teammate who managed the Albany Babies of the South Atlantic League.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nobody,&#x201d; said Cobb. &#x201c;I just had to learn how myself. All you got to do is make up natural, see?&#x201d;<br> <br>But it was hard to see through the smoke Matthews was emitting, and the fat old catcher turned aside and coughed on Cobb&#x2019;s makeup pots. &#x201c;So you&#x2019;re a painter, too, eh?&#x201d; he said finally, chuckling and choking. &#x201c;Ain&#x2019;t I pretty!&#x201d;<br> <br>The other visitor to Cobb&#x2019;s cramped quarters that evening, the person who recorded this sparkling dialogue for posterity, was Howell Foreman, a cub reporter for the Atlanta Constitution. To the then new Atlanta Theater on that long-ago Saturday, Foreman had brought a large supply of mostly inane questions (&#x201c;How do you think the acting of a game of football compares with the playing of a real game of baseball?&#x201d;)&#x2014;but also, it would turn out, the admirable instinct, or maybe it was just the journalistic na�vet� (he was only seventeen), to leave his notes largely unprocessed rather than shaping them into a conventional newspaper piece. The somewhat serpentine result, while not exactly a pleasure to read, provides something like raw security camera footage recording what it was like to be Tyrus Raymond Cobb as the Georgia Peach neared the height of his baseball prowess.<br> <br>It was damn disconcerting. Cobb, who had no acting experience and who, despite being the son of a renowned orator, always felt ill at ease when required to speak in public, was nevertheless spending his early off-season touring the country, or at least a large swath east of the Mississippi, in The College Widow, a well-known comedy in three acts by the celebrated Hoosier humorist George Ade. He played Billy Bolton, a handsome halfback tempted to transfer from Bingham to Atwater College by the latter&#x2019;s coach&#x2019;s conniving blond girlfriend. Although Cobb surprised some people with his almost adequate acting skills, especially those who had expected him to hook-slide in from the wings, snarling, and spike his fellow thespians where they stood, and though tickets were selling briskly in venues North and South, the venture was turning out to be not as enjoyable as George M. Cohan, the famous &#x201c;Yankee Doodle Boy,&#x201d; had assured him it would be over a long, boozy dinner one very complicated (and eventually bloody) night in Cleveland two years earlier. Touring, instead, was strenuous and stressful work performed at a season when he would rather have been tramping through the north Georgia hills with his hunting dogs and his friends&#x2014;say, George Stallings, the former New York Highlanders manager, and Honus Wagner, the star shortstop for the Pittsburgh Pirates, companions on previous bird-shooting trips.<br> <br>But Cobb had made a commitment and because he wanted desperately to avoid disappointing both his audience and his promoters, he devoted much psychic and physical energy to what is supposed to be &#x201c;the art that conceals itself.&#x201d; From a seat near the footlights, you could see him sweat, and those who had spent as much as $1.50 for a ticket (about three times what it cost to watch him play the Cleveland Naps, the St. Louis Browns, or the Philadelphia Athletics) appreciated the sincere effort. In some of the same cities where, in the warmer months, he was booed and barraged with Moxie bottles for being such a danger to the aspirations of the beloved home team, audiences gave him a standing ovation at the end of each act and, as surely as if it was part of the script, shouted &#x201c;Speech! Speech!&#x201d; at the final curtain. But that only maximized Cobb&#x2019;s misery.<br> <br>On the field, he was an extraordinary improviser, and off it, in small groups, a raconteur of the first rank (the veteran catcher Moe Berg, a New Yorker who graduated from Princeton and Columbia Law school and was a frequent houseguest of Cobb&#x2019;s in Augusta, would call him &#x201c;an intellectual giant&#x201d;). Yet at the podium&#x2014;or beneath a proscenium, sans script&#x2014;he lost his composure, and could sound like a typical tongue-tied jock. To avoid the nightmare of extemporaneous curtain-call oratory, Cobb would gesture extravagantly toward his heaving chest, the result of a 105-yard touchdown Billy Bolton had supposedly scored (offstage) in the play&#x2019;s climactic moments, and mime a hero all too willing but alas far too winded to speak. His lame joke always worked, yet the groundlings&#x2019; groans of disappointment wore on him and made him envy the other ballplayer in the original cast, Joe Jackson of the Philadelphia A&#x2019;s, who, despite being a raw rookie, had realized during rehearsals that he was not exactly born to tread the boards and had put on his walking shoes just before the Widow had opened in Trenton.<br> <br>Cobb, who was making $500 a week, or more than twice as much as the relatively large sum he got to play baseball, had kept going, though, and by dint of strenuous concentration and dumb luck avoided disaster&#x2014;until the players reached Pittsburgh, and in the upper right balcony, at the moment of the star&#x2019;s opening night entrance, his twenty-two-month-old son, Ty Jr., had stood up and squealed &#x201c;Daddy! Daddy!&#x201d; The sea of twisting heads and waves of unexpected laughter had nearly capsized Cobb; Ade&#x2019;s lines tapered to a palpitating point in his cortex, then vanished. They came back as soon as the house settled, thank goodness, and the show went on, but of all the nerve-racking moments he had endured in five-plus years of major league baseball&#x2014;and these included fistfights, strained t�te-�-t�tes with President William Howard Taft (&#x201c;Greetings, Citizen Ty!&#x201d;), &#x201c;black hand&#x201d; letters threatening assassination (Cobb&#x2019;s, not Taft&#x2019;s), an endless presentation of watches, trophies, medals, books (he was known as a constant reader), and funereal flower-wreaths, as well as, of course, the occasional arrest for assault and battery&#x2014;none was worse than that momentary Steel City meltdown.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>Ty Cobb didn&#x2019;t need this kind of aggravation. Getting invited to appear in cold-weather vaudeville was, after all, no particular honor. Ballplayers of every stripe had been dabbling in what George M. Cohan would have called &#x201c;the show business&#x201d; since the 1890s, when Adrian &#x201c;Cap&#x201d; Anson, the longtime Chicago White Stocking, then down on his luck, performed a depressing baseball-themed act with two of his grown daughters (he actually did slide into a base secured at center stage). In the months after the 1911 World Series (won by Connie Mack&#x2019;s Athletics over John McGraw&#x2019;s Giants in six games), while Cobb was appearing in The College Widow, Rube Marquard of the Giants was doing stand-up; the Pirates&#x2019; Marty O&#x2019;Toole had a part in a Wild West show; three A&#x2019;s (&#x201c;Chief&#x201d; Bender, Cy Morgan, and Jack Coombs) were appearing with the singing Pearl Sisters; Leonard &#x201c;King&#x201d; Cole of the Cubs, the inspiration for Ring Lardner&#x2019;s &#x201c;Alibi Ike&#x201d; stories, was making the rounds in Chicago doing something vaguely theatrical, and Herman &#x201c;Germany&#x201d; Schaefer, one of Cobb&#x2019;s former Tiger teammates and now a Washington Senator, was touring, with Cobb&#x2019;s apparent blessing, with a satirical recitation called &#x201c;Why Does Tyrus Tire Us?&#x201d; For his acting talents, Cobb was probably pulling down much more than any of them, but by exploiting his fame in that fashion he was aligning himself with a crew composed mostly of prodigals, mediocrities, has-beens, and clowns. (Perhaps all one needs to know about Germany Schaefer is that he was personally responsible for major league baseball&#x2019;s rule 7.08i, which forbids running the bases in reverse.)<br> <br>Cobb in 1911 was still a young man wrestling with the question of what it meant to be this new thing called a celebrity&#x2014;that is, when he was not down under the grandstand, postgame, wrestling with an umpire, teammate, or rival. If he was in fact the greatest player in the history of baseball, as no one less than Charles Comiskey, the president of the Chicago White Sox and one of the founding fathers of the modern game, had declared recently in a syndicated newspaper essay that was the talk of the sports world, then how did that status translate to his day-to-day existence? Cobb could not figure out whether, in real life, he should play the ultrasensitive Southern cavalier or the courtly, gregarious Georgia gent, and he wavered between the two roles his whole career. Yet coming off the 1911 campaign, he was fairly certain that the annual festival of postseason stunt casting was beneath his dignity.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>Some people, some Sabermetricians, will tell you that 1911 was not the best of Cobb&#x2019;s 231/2 seasons, and it&#x2019;s true that in such esoteric categories as &#x201c;run production&#x201d; and &#x201c;batting average relative to the rest of the league,&#x201d; it demonstrably wasn&#x2019;t. But you needn&#x2019;t be a baseball nerd to know it was pretty wonderful. Cobb batted .420 that year, and set records for RBI (127), hits (248), runs (147), stolen bases (83), and longest hitting streak (40 games), all despite suffering for much of the summer from a hacking cough and stomach problems, which he thought might be typhoid but which were more likely nerves, and often playing against doctor&#x2019;s orders. The numbers, naturally, never tell the full story and in Cobb&#x2019;s case they fail to convey what an exciting player the haunted-looking, light-hitting rookie of 1905 had become: part Wee Willie Keeler (&#x201c;Hit &#x2019;em where they ain&#x2019;t&#x201d;), part Freud, part Puck. Art history majors might also compare him to Caravaggio, the conflicted, creative firebrand of whom it was written in 1604, &#x201c;he will swagger about . . . with a sword at his side, from one ball-court to the next, ever ready to engage in a fight or an argument, so that it is most awkward to get along with him.&#x201d; Cobb, though, never had to go looking for people to tussle with; they usually came (to speak like Cobb for a moment) a-calling.<br> <br>In his prime Tyrus Raymond Cobb was a good-looking man&#x2014;six feet tall and 190 pounds&#x2014;who believed something fairly revolutionary for his time: that success in baseball went to the smart. He held the bat with a split-hands grip&#x2014;unusual but not unique&#x2014;that allowed him to make a last-second decision, to choke up and poke the ball over an infielder&#x2019;s head&#x2014;or slide his top hand down and swing for the fences (which, in the deadball era, were roughly a million miles away). Employed over the course of nearly two dozen major league seasons, this technique allowed Cobb to achieve a lifetime batting average of .366, amazing in his day and still the highest ever. But it was his philosophy of the game, not the bat-grip he shared with Honus Wagner and a few others, that accounted for his greatness.<br> <br>That philosophy could be pared down to two words: pay attention. &#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t out-hit the opposition and he didn&#x2019;t outrun them,&#x201d; Cobb&#x2019;s longtime teammate and onetime tormentor &#x201c;Wahoo&#x201d; Sam Crawford said. &#x201c;He out-thought them!&#x201d; Cobb spent his days studying his baseball rivals and mentally cataloging their tendencies, strengths, and faults, both as players and human beings, since he felt he could exploit both to his professional advantage; many evenings, while his teammates hung out in the hotel lobby (the pastime within the pastime in those potted-palmy days) or hoisted beers, he would sit in his room making notes and sketching plays while listening to classical violinist Fritz Kreisler on the gramophone. His &#x201c;personal batboy&#x201d;&#x2014;Cobb could be more than a bit of a diva&#x2014;Jimmy Lanier, said, &#x201c;Cobb would lay awake in bed engrossed in plots to out-smart opposing members of other American League clubs.&#x201d; &#x201c;Some of my best ideas,&#x201d; Cobb himself said in a syndicated newspaper series that appeared in 1914, &#x201c;have come to me at night just before I fall asleep, when, they say, great poems often come to their authors. I get up and write them down.&#x201d;<br> <br>He was intrigued by the unpredictability of baseball, he often said, but it was perfecting ways to influence the proceedings and control the outcomes of various game situations that gave him the most satisfaction. He loved, for example, to find himself on third against the Highlanders (who were just starting to be known also as the Yankees in those days) because he knew that by dancing off the bag he could almost always draw a risky cross-diamond throw from their first baseman Hal Chase after a routine putout&#x2014;and dash for home if the peg went awry. (It was pliable rivals like Chase that allowed Cobb to steal home 54 times in his career, another record that still stands.) Stepping into the box, Cobb liked to see a catcher staring at his feet to determine if he was thinking &#x201c;pull&#x201d; (feet spread wide apart) or &#x201c;opposite field.&#x201d; When under such scrutiny, Cobb would often assume one kind of stance, then hop to another as the pitcher released the ball, a fake-out move that some old-timers considered dirty pool.<br> <br>Nothing pleased Cobb more, though, than the way he was able to handle the future Hall of Famer Walter Johnson, ace of the Washington Senators, the hardest thrower in the American League. After he noticed how upset the good-hearted Big Train got when he beaned batters, Cobb stood in against him as he did against nobody else, hunching over the plate and sticking his head into the strike zone. He could have gotten killed; instead, very often, he got walked.<br> <br>But the Peach&#x2019;s &#x201c;pay attention&#x201d; approach worked both ways. As much as he studied you he wanted you to think about him, so he could mess with your composure and your expectations, exploit your laziness or lack of focus, expose your particular and perhaps very personal fears. The hyperbolic sportswriters of the day credited Cobb with bringing psychology to a game previously packed with Bunyanesque bumpkins swinging rough-hewn clubs at saliva-sodden spheres&#x2014;and hailed what he was doing as &#x201c;scientific baseball.&#x201d;<br> <br>Or at least some of them did, some of the time. Journalistic standards were different then, and wildly inconsistent. Scandalous or embarrassing off-the-field incidents might be overlooked or played down as a favor to one of the participants. That Cobb&#x2019;s mother had shot and killed his father a few days before Ty&#x2019;s major league debut, that the minor league player the Tigers wanted over Cobb, Clyde Engle, was hampered by gonorrhea, that Cobb missed time early in the 1906 season because he had what was then called a nervous breakdown&#x2014;such things were obscured by euphemisms if they were written about at all. In other cases, though, controversies might be concocted or exaggerated to please the sports editor and the reading public. Quotes were frequently manufactured, or so polished you could see the writer&#x2019;s face in them; throw-pillow-worthy aphorisms and corny jokes...</p><h2>Auschwitz: Not Long Ago.

Reprint.</p><p>As Apsley Cherry-Garrard states in his introduction to the harrowing story of the Scott expedition to the South Pole, "Polar Exploration is at once the cleanest and most isolated way of having a bad time which has been devised." Cherry-Garrard's <i>The Worst Journey in the World</i> is a gripping account of an expedition gone disastrously wrong. The youngest member of Scott's team, the author was later part of the rescue party that eventually found the frozen bodies of Scott and three men who had accompanied Scott on the final push to the Pole. These deaths would haunt Cherry-Garrard for the rest of his life as he questioned the decisions he had made and the actions he had taken in the days leading up to the Polar Party's demise. <p>Prior to this sad denouement, Cherry-Garrard's account is filled with details of scientific discovery and anecdotes of human resilience in a harsh environment. Each participant in the Scott expedition is brought fully to life. Cherry-Garrard's recollections are supported by diary excerpts and accounts from other teammates. Despite the sad fate of Scott, the reader will grudgingly agree with the closing words of <i>The Worst Journey in the World</i>: "Exploration is the physical expression of the Intellectual Passion. And I tell you, if you have the desire for knowledge and the power to give it physical expression, go out and explore.... If you march your Winter Journeys you will have your reward, so long as all you want is a penguin's egg."</p>"Polar exploration is at once the cleanest and most isolated way of having a bad time that has ever been devised" wrote Apsley Cherry-Garrard in a deceptively jaunty introduction to this classic story of bravery and fortitude first published in 1922. The story he relates is of Scott's last expedition to the Antarctic. From its departure from England in 1910 to its arrival in New Zealand in 1913, it is one of the most famous and tragic in the annals of exploration. Driven by an obsession for scientific knowledge, these brave polar explorers embarked on a journey into the unknown, testing their endurance by pushing themselves to the ultimate physical and mental limits as they surveyed the striking and mammoth land that lay far to the south.<br>Cherry-Garrard was himself a member of the expedition that had two goals: to discover as much as was scientifically possible about the terrain and habitat of Antarctica, and to be the first to reach the South Pole. The party was plagued by bad luck, weather conditions of unanticipated ferocity, and the physical deterioration of the party on the last part of the journey. Confronted by the shattering knowledge that Roald Amundsen had reached the South Pole a month before them, Scott's party then had to negotiate the last, heroic part of their journey, a doomed attempt which has entered modern mythology.<br>The Worst Journey in the World is the inside story of this most famous of journeys and is truly one of the best and most moving books of travel ever written. Join Scott's expedition as he and his team venture deep into the frozen unknown.

Now, in these challenging new essays, he examines the world&#x2019;s ongoing war on terrorism, from America to Iraq, from Europe to Israel, and beyond.<br><br> In direct language, Hanson portrays an America making progress against Islamic fundamentalism but hampered by the self-hatred of elite academics at home and the cynical self-interest of allies abroad. He sees a new and urgent struggle of evil against good, one that can fail only if &#x201c;we convince ourselves that our enemies fight because of something we, rather than they, did.&#x201d;<br><br> Whether it&#x2019;s a clear-cut defense of Israel as a secular democracy, a denunciation of how the U.N. undermines the U.S., a plea to drastically alter our alliance with Saudi Arabia, or a perception that postwar Iraq is reaching a dangerous tipping point, Hanson&#x2019;s arguments have the shock of candor and the fire of conviction.</p><p><b>Victor Davis Hanson</b> was educated at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, and received his Ph.D. in Classics from Stanford University.

Those who deny such a watershed event take a superficially short-term view and seem to think all is as before simply because the sun still rises and sets.<br><br>This is a colossal misjudgment. The collapse of the towers, the crashing into the Pentagon, and the murder of three thousand Americans--all seen live in real time by millions the world over--tore off a scab and exposed deep wounds, which, if and when they heal, will leave ugly scars for decades. The killers dealt in icons--the choice of 9/11 as the date of death, targeting the manifest symbols of global capitalism and American military power, and centering their destruction on the largest Jewish city in the world. Yes, they got their symbols in spades, but they have no idea that their killing has instead become emblematic of changes that they could scarcely imagine.<br><br>Islamic fundamentalism has proved not ascendant but static, morally repugnant--and the worst plague upon the Arab world since the Crusades. By lurking in the shadows and killing incrementally through stealth, the vampirish terrorists garnered bribes and subsidies through threats and bombs; but, pale and wrinkled in the daylight after 9/11, they prove only ghoulish, not fearsome.<br><br>The more the world knows of al Qaeda and bin Laden, the more it has found them both vile and yet banal--and so is confident and eager to eradicate them and all they stand for. It is one thing to kill innocents, quite another to take on the armed might of an aroused United States. Easily dodging a solo cruise missile in the vastness of Afghanistan may make good theater and bring about braggadocio; dealing with grim American and British commandos who have come seven thousand miles for your head prompts abject flight and an occasional cheap infomercial on the run. And the ultimate consequence of the attacks of September 11 will not merely be the destruction of al Qaeda but also the complete repudiation of the Taliban, the Iranian mullocracy, the plague of the Pakistani madrasahs, and any other would-be fundamentalist paradise on earth.<br><br>Foreign relations will not be the same in our generation. Our coalition with Europe, we learn, was not a partnership but more mere alphabetic nomenclature and the mutual back-scratching of Euro-American globe-trotters--a paper alliance without a mission nearly fifteen years after the end of the Cold War. The truth is that Europe, out of noble purposes, for a decade has insidiously eroded its collective national sovereignty in order to craft an antidemocratic EU, an 80,000-person fuzzy bureaucracy whose executive power is as militarily weak as it is morally ambiguous in its reliance on often dubious international accords. This sad realization September 11 brutally exposed, and we all should cry for the beloved continent that has for the moment completely lost its moral bearings. Indeed, as the months progressed, the problems inherent in "the European way" became all too apparent: pretentious utopian manifestos in lieu of military resoluteness, abstract moralizing to excuse dereliction of concrete ethical responsibility, and constant American ankle-biting even as Europe lives in a make-believe Shire while we keep back the forces of Mordor from its picturesque borders, with only a few brave Frodos and Bilbos tagging along. Nothing has proved more sobering to Americans than the skepticism of these blinkered European hobbits after September 11.<br><br>America learned that "moderate" Arab countries are as dangerous as hostile Islamic nations. After September 11, being a Saudi, Egyptian, or Kuwaiti means nothing special to an American--at least not proof of being any more friendly or hostile than having Libyan, Syrian, or Lebanese citizenship. Indeed, our entire postwar policy of propping up autocracies on the triad of their anticommunism, oil, and arms purchases--like NATO--belongs to a pre-9/11 age of Soviet aggrandizement and petroleum monopolies. Now we learn that broadcasting state-sponsored hatred of Israel and the United States is just as deadly to our interests as Scud missiles--and as likely to come from friends as enemies. Worst-case scenarios like Iran and Afghanistan offer more long-term hope than "stable regimes" like the Saudis; governments that hate us have populations that like us, and vice versa; the Saudi royal family, whom ten thousand American troops protect, and the Mubarak autocracy, which has snagged billions of American dollars, are as afraid of democratic reformers as they are Islamic fundamentalists. And with good reason: Islamic governments in Iran and under the Taliban were as hated by the masses as Arab secular reformers in exile in the West are praised and championed.<br><br>The post-9/11 domestic calculus is just as confusing. Generals and the military brass call civilians who seek the liberation of Iraq "chicken hawks" and worse. Yet such traditional Vietnam-era invective I think rings hollow after September 11, and sounds more like McClellan's shrillness against his civilian overseers who precipitously wanted an odious slavery ended than resonant of Patton's audacity in charging after murderous Nazis. More Americans were destroyed at work in a single day than all those soldiers killed in enemy action since the evacuation of Vietnam nearly thirty years ago. Indeed, most troops who went through the ghastly inferno of Vietnam are now in or nearing retirement; and, thank God, there is no generation of Americans in the present military--other than a few thousand brave veterans of the Gulf, Mogadishu, and Panama--who have been in sustained and deadly shooting with heavy casualties. Because American soldiers and their equipment are as impressive as our own domestic security is lax, in this gruesome war it may well be more perilous to work high up in lower Manhattan, fly regularly on a jumbo jet, or handle mail at the Pentagon or CIA than be at sea on a sub or destroyer.<br><br>Real concern for the sanctity of life may hinge on employing, rather than rejecting, force, inasmuch as our troops are as deadly and protected abroad as our women, children, aged, and civilians are impotent and vulnerable at home. It seems to me a more moral gamble to send hundreds of pilots into harm's way than allow a madman to further his plots to blow up or infect thousands in high-rises.<br><br>Politics have been turned upside down. In the old days, cynical conservatives were forced to hold their noses and to practice a sometimes repellent Realpolitik. In the age of Russian expansionism, they were loathe to champion democracy when it might usher in a socialist Trojan horse whose belly harbored totalitarians disguised as parliamentarians. Thus they were so often at loggerheads with naive and idealist leftists.<br><br>No longer. The end of the specter of a deadly and aggressive Soviet communism has revived democratic ideology as a force in diplomacy. Champions of freedom no longer sigh and back opportunistic rightist thugs who promise open economics, loot their treasuries, and keep out the Russians. Instead, even reactionaries are now more likely to push for democratic governments in the Middle East than are dour and skeptical leftists. The latter, if multiculturalists, often believe that democracy is a value-neutral Western construct, not necessarily a universal good; if pacifists, they claim nonintervention, not justice, as their first priority. The right, not the left, now is the greater proponent of global freedom, liberation, and idealism--with obvious domestic ramifications for any Republican president astute enough to tap that rich vein of popular support.<br><br>All this and more are the wages of the disaster of September 11 and the subsequent terrible year--and yet it is likely that, for good or evil, we will see things even more incredible in the twelve months ahead.<br><br> Written on September 9 and published in National Review Online on September 11, 2002.<br>2<br><br>Al Qaedism<br><br>FROM CRIMINALITY TO POLITICS IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE<br>A disturbed teen crashes a light plane into an office building in Florida and leaves a suicide note, apparently praising the work of bin Laden. Relieved that hundreds were not killed, officials properly assure us that his desperate act is a sign of mental illness or family despair, and not connected to global terrorism. At the Los Angeles airport a supposedly unhinged Egyptian emigre murders innocents at the El Al Airline counter; we are reminded by pundits and diplomats that the anti-Semite once again acted alone and thus was not a part of an al Qaeda cell.<br><br>Snipers in Maryland and Virginia blast apart civilians at random. Thereafter we are advised that although one was an angry Black Muslim and the two previously had expressed approval of the September 11 attacks and had very disturbing appurtenances in their car, both were not in any formal sense a part of al Qaeda. Arrests of various conspirators on both the East and West Coasts, who either visited Afghanistan or helped to organize Islamic "charities" as fronts for terrorists raise more controversy than relief--as anguished relatives swear that the indictment of such American patriots is proof of anti-Islamic prejudice rather than proper homeland security. We still do not know the exact circumstances of the anthrax letters; yet we are lectured that earlier reports that one of the September 11 murderers may have had a cutaneous form of the rare disease and that letters connecting the bacilli with terrorist fury were probably bogus.<br><br>This caution is perhaps fine and proper, as it should be, since there is not always legal proof implicating any of these events with a worldwide al Qaeda network. But in some sense, it doesn't matter.<br><br>The violent terrorist acts share an ostensible theme of either reflecting the aims of al Qaeda or professing some sympathy with radical Islamic fundamentalism. They are as dangerous as the work of terror cells because they presage a sporadic, spontaneous, and nearly unpredictable outbreak of violence that is also decentralized and untraceable. In short, rather than being al Qaeda shock troops, these killers and criminals are al Qaedistic--or perhaps show symptoms of a malady we should call "al Qaedism."<br><br>One did not need to be a formal follower of Hitler to be fascistic, or a member of Stalin's party to be communistic. In fact, the Greek suffix "-istic" ("like" or "pertaining to") can mean simulation of, or empathy with, the real thing. What are the symptoms of such a pathology like al Qaedism? How does it spread? And how can it be eradicated?<br><br>Thousands of Americans are wicked or mentally troubled, often with records of criminal activity or signs of such intent. Most murder, maim, rob banks, or commit other such mayhem, and leave it at that, seeking no claim of higher political import for their odious crimes. But not all--and not after 9/11.<br><br>On the campus in the 1970s, both petty criminals and megalomaniac thugs sought to mask their selfish and narcissistic agendas under the more cosmic cloak of the antiwar movement, national liberation, or utopian egalitarianism. So the felons of the Black Panther Party, the grim killers and bank robbers of the Symbionese Liberation Army, and many of the mad bombers of the Weathermen were encouraged by the rhetoric of the nebulous resistance movement to act out their violent propensities--in hopes that allegiance to some half-baked philosophy would make them revolutionaries rather than the felons they were.<br><br>So it was with criminals like the would-be mass murderer Richard Reid and the two snipers, who all had either a prior rap sheet or displayed signs of real instability, but perhaps wished to evolve from two-bit losers into momentary warriors--on the idea that their crimes might at last find transcendence in some sort of ad hoc jihad. In that sense, the cheap rhetoric of al Qaeda--a godless and oppressive United States wars unjustly against poor Muslims and the dispossessed of the globe; Jews conspire everywhere; decadent Western society must cede to a puritanical Islam--can energize an otherwise pedestrian cruelty and thereby salvage a cause from a personal sense of failure and inadequacy.<br><br>Rather than confront the reality of past character flaws, mental instability, failed marriages, or the bleak future of no money, dead-end jobs, or social ostracism, the al Qaedist--whether an erstwhile Black Muslim, a Middle Eastern immigrant with a criminal past, or a mixed-up, pampered suburbanite who dabbles in fundamentalism--seeks notoriety for his crimes, and therein perhaps at last a sense of importance.<br><br>Unfortunately to the snipers' innocent targets in Virginia and Maryland--or any others who will die by unhinged al Qaeda wannabes--it makes no difference whether they were the victims of terror or terroristic behavior. Law-enforcement officials, of course, are growing worried about such trends--as if the ideology of al Qaeda quite independently across time and space can infect crazy, mean people and prompt them to act out their dreams in violently anti-American fashion. Al Qaedism, after all, can serve as a sort of receptacle for extreme lunatics of the anti-Americanism brand who seek purer and more violent avenues of expression.<br><br>In the 1930s there were literally thousands of unbalanced Westerners outside Germany who paraded around in black shirts and aped Hitler. No doubt had the Third Reich not been demolished the more deranged would have continued to dress up their criminality with Nazi slogans, violent anti-Semitism, and terrorist acts. But by 1945 few would-be National Socialists were prominent. Violent fellow travelers were common in the 1930s and 1940s; indeed, the archives of arrested Stalinists often reveal those who tried to find some higher plane to act out their innate criminal propensities, alleviate deep personal maladies, or simply assuage their own failure by displaying anger toward Western society. Yet we see few such dangerous misfits after the fall of the Berlin Wall.<br><br>To rid us of al Qaedists, then, we must first not merely destroy al Qaeda, but do so in such comprehensive and humiliating fashion that the easy emulation of the radical Islamicist agenda not only draws opposition from friends and family but utter ridicule. And at home, Americans must not be afraid to address extremism when they see it, refute it--and do so in such a way that its perpetrators incur shame and odium on themselves rather than inspire the criminal, hateful, or mentally ill to equate their anger and failure with a virulent anti-Americanism.<br><br>I suppose it was entirely legal last Halloween for the New Black Panther Party and its Islamic fundamentalist allies--firebrands like Imam Abdul Alim Musa, Imam Muhammad Asi, Imam Abdel Razzag Al Raggad, and others--to voice empathy for the Taliban, express publicly racist and anti-Semitic hatred, and convey sympathy for those who murdered three thousand Americans. But it was not a very moral act for C-Span to broadcast that repulsive propaganda live from the National Press Club at a time of war.<br><br>Watching protesters in the recent antiwar march in Washington on public television no doubt gives balance to the debate, but again broadcasting shots of posters that declared i love iraq, bomb texas or photos of the president of the United States with a Hitlerian mustache and Nazi salute crosses the line of good taste.<br><br>By the same token, it is very American for zealots to shout displeasure at their government, but their slurs that the president of the United States, the vice president, and the secretary of defense are the "true axis of evil" rather than Stalinist North Korea, fascistic Iraq, or theocratic Iran have consequences in the future that we cannot predict in the presen...</p><h2>The Adventure of English</h2><p><p>English is the collective work of millions of people throughout the ages. It is democratic, ever-changing and ingenious in its assimilation of other cultures. English runs through the heart of world finance, medicine and the Internet, and it is understood by around two thousand million people across the world. Yet it was very nearly wiped out in its early years.</p><p>In this book Melvyn Bragg shows us the remarkable story of the English language; from its beginnings as a minor guttural Germanic dialect to its position today as a truly established global language. THE ADVENTURE OF ENGLISH is not only an enthralling story of power, religion and trade, but also the story of people, and how their day-to-day lives shaped and continue to change the extraordinary language that is English.</p></p><p>Melvyn Bragg is a writer and broadcaster. His novels include<i>The Hired Man</i>, for which he won the Time/Life Silver Pen Award,<i>Without a City Wall</i>, winner of the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize,<i>The Soldier's Return,</i>winner of the WHSmith Literary Award,<i>A Son of War</i>and<i>Crossing the Lines</i>, both of which were longlisted for the Man Booker Prize,<i>A Place in England,</i>which was longlisted for the Lost Man Booker Prize, and most recently<i>Grace and Mary.</i>He has also written several works of non-fiction, including<i>The Book of Books</i>about the King James Bible. He lives in London and Cumbria.This compelling and charmingly personal companion to an eight-part television documentary (scheduled for the fall) makes for an idiosyncratic rival to PBS's bestselling blockbuster <i>The Story of English</i>, by Robert McCrum et al<i>.</i> Titling a history of the evolution and expansion of a language an "adventure" presupposes a hero, with such obvious choices as Alfred the Great, for defeating the Danes; Chaucer, for his <i>Canterbury Tales</i>; Shakespeare, for his poetic inventiveness; or Samuel Johnson, for his groundbreaking dictionary. Bragg, a British TV and radio personality and novelist (<i>The Soldier's Return</i>), gives all their contributions their due, but English itself, with its "deep obstinacy" and "astonishing flexibility," emerges as his favorite character. Bragg's enthusiasm for his subject-hero, whether the Old English of <i>Beowulf </i>or the new "Text English" of the Internet, makes up for his shortcomings as a linguist: his sources, unfootnoted, are at times at variance with the OED or Webster's Third. For instance, Bragg furnishes only one putative origin for the disputed "real McCoy." Moreover "candy" does not seem to have Anglo-Indian origins (it's from the Arabic "qandi"), and the first recorded use of "vast" is not from Shakespeare (the OED cites Archbishop Edwin Sandys). Nevertheless, this "biography" succeeds in its broad, sweeping narrative, carrying the reader from the origins of Anglo-Saxon through the Viking and Norman invasions to the consolidation of "British" English and outward to America, Australia, India, the West Indies and beyond. After some 1,500 years, with one billion speakers now worldwide, according to Bragg, the English language has displayed an amazing ability to repair and reinvent itself, as Bragg ably shows. 32 pages of color illus. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It was Friday, May 5, 2006, and warm temperatures had softened the earth at Sunset Cemetery in Manhattan, Kansas. Clump by clump, the balding forty-four-year-old sexton meticulously dug a grave, piling the dirt beside it. In twenty-four hours, the ashen remains of the city&#x2019;s most famous son would be laid to rest there. Hardly anyone knew the burial was happening, and Mohler aimed to keep it that way.<br> <br>The night before, Mohler had been home watching television when his phone rang. It was about nine p.m., and the caller didn&#x2019;t identify herself. &#x201c;We have a burial coming your way,&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>An odd way to begin a call, thought Mohler. Especially one made to his home at such a late hour.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the name of the deceased?&#x201d; he asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t tell you that,&#x201d; the woman said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, I can&#x2019;t help you if you won&#x2019;t give me a name,&#x201d; he told her.<br> <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t do that unless you sign confidentiality papers,&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>Mohler told her that wouldn&#x2019;t be necessary. The state had required him to sign documents promising confidentiality when he became a sexton seventeen years earlier.<br> <br>&#x201c;I need to know who I&#x2019;m burying to even know if they have a plot here,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>She assured Mohler that the deceased had a burial plot. Then Mohler heard a male voice in the background say: &#x201c;Just tell him who he&#x2019;s burying.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m calling on behalf of Tiger Woods,&#x201d; the woman told Mohler. &#x201c;His father has passed.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lieutenant Colonel Earl Dennison Woods died of a heart attack at his home in Cypress, California, on May 3, 2006. He was seventy-four years old and had been in failing health, his body weakened by cancer and his longtime affection for alcohol and cigarettes. A Green Beret who served two tours in Vietnam, Earl achieved worldwide acclaim for his almost mythical role in raising the most famous golfer of all time. He was notorious for making outlandish statements, like the time he predicted in Sports Illustrated that his then twenty-year-old son would have more influence on the world than Nelson Mandela, Gandhi, or Buddha. &#x201c;He is the Chosen One,&#x201d; Earl told the magazine. &#x201c;He will have the power to impact nations.&#x201d;<br> <br>Those were overwhelming expectations. Yet Tiger repeatedly said that no one in the world knew him better than his father, the man he frequently referred to as his &#x201c;best friend&#x201d; and &#x201c;hero.&#x201d; Together they shared one of the most memorable moments in sports history. Immediately after Tiger sank his final putt to win the 1997 Masters by a record twelve strokes, Earl gave him an iconic bear hug. In what was the most-watched golf broadcast in US history, an estimated forty-three million viewers&#x2014;almost 15 percent of all American households&#x2014;witnessed father and son sobbing in each other&#x2019;s arms as Earl said, &#x201c;I love you, son.&#x201d; Dozens of golf telecasts had similarly ended with the two of them embracing and Earl whispering those same four words.<br> <br>But Mike Mohler didn&#x2019;t watch golf tournaments. He just wasn&#x2019;t a fan of the game. He&#x2019;d never even picked up a club. Still, he admired Tiger Woods, and he took great pride in digging the elder Woods&#x2019;s grave. Using a cemetery map, Mohler had located Earl&#x2019;s burial lot&#x2014;block 5, lot 12, grave 02&#x2014;right between his parents, Miles and Maude Woods. Since taking over as sexton in 1989, Mohler had dug more than two thousand graves. Earl&#x2019;s would be a lot smaller than most: he had been cremated. Tiger and his mother, Kultida, were flying from Southern California with a shallow ten-inch-by-ten-inch square wooden box that contained Earl&#x2019;s ashes. Mohler was ready for them. After nearly an hour of digging, he had fashioned a grave that resembled a miniature elevator shaft. It was twelve inches long by twelve inches wide, and forty-two inches deep. Using a shovel, he scraped away the loose dirt from the sides, making the edges ruler-straight.<br> <br>The next day, at around noon, two limousines pulled up to an old section of the cemetery. Tiger; his wife, Elin; and Tiger&#x2019;s mother got out of the first car, and Earl&#x2019;s three children from his first marriage exited the second. Mohler and his wife, Kay, met them. Near the end of the twenty-minute ceremony, Kultida handed Mohler the wooden box containing her husband&#x2019;s ashes. He placed it in the hole and added cement. With the family looking on, Mohler carefully packed the hole with dirt, leveled off the top, and covered it with a piece of sod. The family then filed back into the limousines and&#x2014;after a brief stop at Earl&#x2019;s childhood home&#x2014;returned to the airport.<br> <br>Days later, when word got out that Earl Woods had been interred, the local business that produced headstones and gravestones&#x2014;an outfit called Manhattan Monuments&#x2014;anticipated an order for a large granite monument. They called Mohler, but he had no information. Neither Tiger nor his mother had left any instructions for a headstone.<br> <br>At first, Mohler thought the family just needed time to figure out what they wanted. Everyone grieves differently, he knew. But five and then ten years passed, and the family still had not ordered a grave marker.<br> <br>&#x201c;There is no gravestone,&#x201d; Mohler said in 2015. &#x201c;Not for him. His grave isn&#x2019;t marked at all. The only way to tell where Earl Woods is buried is to know where to look for the corner markers buried in the earth. You have to have a map to find them.&#x201d;<br> <br>In the end, Earl Dennison Woods was buried in the Kansas dirt in an unmarked grave. No stone. No inscription. Nothing.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s like he&#x2019;s not even there,&#x201d; said Mohler.<br> <br>Tiger Woods was the kind of transcendent star that comes around about as often as Halley&#x2019;s Comet. By almost any measure, he is the most talented golfer who ever lived, and arguably the greatest individual athlete in modern history. For a fifteen-year span&#x2014;from August 1994, when he won his first of three consecutive US Amateur Championships as an eighteen-year-old high school senior, to the early-morning hours of November 27, 2009, when he crashed his SUV into a tree and effectively ended the most dominant run in the history of golf&#x2014;Woods was a human whirlwind of heart-stopping drama and entertainment, responsible for some of the most memorable moments in the history of televised sports.<br> <br>Woods will forever be measured against Jack Nicklaus, who won more major championships. But the Tiger Effect can&#x2019;t be measured in statistics. A literary comparison may be more fitting. Given the full spectrum of his awe-inspiring gifts, Woods was nothing less than a modern-day Shakespeare. He was someone no one had ever seen or will ever see again.<br> <br>Woods&#x2019;s golfing legacy borders on the unimaginable. He was both the first golfer with African American heritage and the youngest golfer in history to win a major championship. He won fourteen majors overall on his way to seventy-nine PGA Tour victories (second all-time behind Sam Snead) and more than one hundred worldwide. He holds the record for most consecutive cuts made (142, covering nearly eight years) and number of weeks ranked no. 1 in the world (683). In addition, he was honored as Player of the Year a record eleven times, captured the annual scoring title a record nine times, and won more than $110 million in official prize money&#x2014;another record. The tournaments he played in shattered attendance marks throughout the world and consistently set viewership records on television, his charismatic presence and two decades of dominance the driving forces in the stratospheric rise in official PGA Tour purses from $67 million in 1996, his first year as a pro, to a record $363 million in 2017&#x2013;18, and the rise of the average Tour purse from $1.5 million to $7.4 million during the same period. In the process, he helped make multimillionaires of more than four hundred Tour pros. Pure and simple, Woods changed the face of golf&#x2014;athletically, socially, culturally, and financially.<br> <br>At the height of Tiger&#x2019;s career, golf beat the NFL and the NBA in Nielsen ratings. As a spokesman for Nike, American Express, Disney, Gillette, General Motors, Rolex, Accenture, Gatorade, General Mills, and EA Sports, he appeared in television commercials, on billboards, and in magazines and newspapers. He was mobbed by fans wherever he went&#x2014;France, Thailand, England, Japan, Germany, South Africa, Australia, even Dubai. Kings and presidents courted him. Corporations wooed him. Rock stars and Hollywood actors wanted to be him. Women wanted to sleep with him. For the better part of two decades, he was simply the most famous athlete on earth.<br> <br>Tiger wasn&#x2019;t just alone atop the world of golf. In a very literal sense, he was alone, period. Despite his killer instinct on the course, he was an introvert off it, more comfortable playing video games, watching television, or practicing and training in solitude. As far back as childhood, he spent far more time by himself in his bedroom than playing outside with other children. An only child, he learned early on that his parents were the only ones he should truly trust and rely on. They more or less programmed him that way. His father took on the roles of golf mentor, sage, visionary, and best friend. His mother, Kultida, was Tiger&#x2019;s disciplinarian and fearsome protector. Together, his parents proved an impregnable force that never let anyone trespass on the tightly guarded path to success they had paved for their son. In their Southern California home, where life revolved around Tiger and golf, the mantra was clear: Family is everything.<br> <br>The Woods family dynamic made Tiger the most mysterious athlete of his time, an enigma obsessed with privacy who mastered the art of being invisible in plain sight, of saying something while revealing virtually nothing. On one hand, he grew up before our eyes, appearing on television shows as early as age two and being photographed and chronicled throughout his childhood. On the other hand, so much of his true family history and personal life remains shrouded in conditional interviews, carefully constructed press releases, mythical tales, half-truths, sophisticated advertising campaigns, and tabloid headlines.<br> <br>So we were not surprised when Woods, through his chief spokesman, Glenn Greenspan, declined to be interviewed for this book. (Or, to be more precise, we were told that before any interview would be &#x201c;considered&#x201d; we needed to disclose whom we spoke to, what they said, and the specific questions we would be asking, conditions that we were not willing to meet.) Woods&#x2019;s mother, Kultida, in turn, did not respond to our request for an interview. Woods did, however, authorize his longtime chiropractor to provide a comprehensive statement about his treatment of Woods and the issue of performance-enhancing drugs.<br> <br>In an effort to be comprehensive, we began by reading every book of significance about Woods&#x2014;more than twenty in all&#x2014;authored by him, his father, former coaches, a former caddie, Earl&#x2019;s first wife (Barbara Woods Gary), and more. Included on that list were the often outstanding efforts of journalists such as Tom Callahan, John Feinstein, Steve Helling, Robert Lusetich, Tim Rosaforte, Howard Sounes, and John Strege. We would be remiss if we failed to single out two invaluable sources of information: The 1997 Masters: My Story by Tiger Woods with Lorne Rubenstein, published in 2017 on the twentieth anniversary of Woods&#x2019;s historic win at Augusta, and The Big Miss: My Years Coaching Tiger Woods by Hank Haney. We mined virtually every page of both books for insight, facts, and reflections that kept our narrative true and on track. In addition, we read books on Buddhism, Navy SEALs, gifted children, success, the business of golf, sex addiction, compulsive behavior, infidelity, and performance-enhancing drugs. Simultaneously, we spent months constructing a comprehensive 120-page time line of Woods&#x2019;s life, detailing every significant moment or event dating back to the birth of his parents. We also reviewed the transcripts of more than 320 official press conferences at which Tiger spoke between 1996 and 2017, as well as dozens of transcripts of interviews he granted on a wide range of topics with news organizations and television programs. With the help of a researcher at Sports Illustrated, we compiled and read thousands of newspaper, magazine, and journal articles about Tiger. And with assistance from CBS, NBC, Golf Channel, and the PGA Tour, we looked at more than a hundred hours of footage of Tiger on and off the course.<br> <br>Over a three-year period, we also conducted more than four hundred interviews with over 250 people from every walk of Woods&#x2019;s life, from teaching professionals and swing coaches who once occupied a place in his inner circle to close friends on and off the Tour, to his first true love. But some of our greatest insights came from the scores of people in Tiger&#x2019;s past who have never been interviewed previously&#x2014;those who helped finance his amateur career, the owner of the Augusta home where Tiger stayed during the Masters year after year, a close female confidant, former employees, business partners, his scuba-diving instructor, his neighbors in Isleworth, and those who worked with him behind the scenes at IMG, Nike, Titleist, EA Sports, NBC Sports, and CBS Sports.<br> <br>Early on we discovered that two of the qualities Woods values most are privacy and loyalty. As to the former, many of the individuals we approached&#x2014;from Tiger&#x2019;s former agent J. Hughes Norton III to past employees of Tiger&#x2019;s ETW Corp.&#x2014;had signed nondisclosure agreements that prohibited them from speaking to us. &#x201c;I was, as most others in his circle were, sworn to contracts and other legal documents,&#x201d; one former employee told us in an email. It&#x2019;s not unusual for public figures to require those around them&#x2014;especially those with access to family members and personal information&#x2014;to sign confidentiality agreements. But Tiger took extraordinary steps to protect even the most mundane information about his past. For example, he personally requested that his high school yearbooks not be shared with anyone. Remarkably, the public school district granted his wish, telling us we were not allowed to look at them. (We ended up viewing his yearbooks at the local library instead.) As for loyalty, individual after individual told us they would &#x201c;have to check with Tiger&#x201d; before agreeing to speak. One former high school classmate of his whom we approached in hopes of simply learning about Anaheim&#x2019;s Western High School said he would first need permission from Tiger. We told him not to bother.<br> <br>All of this begs the question: Why tackle this project in the first place? Our answer is simple: Very few individuals are known throughout the world by one word. Tiger reached that exclusive club by being the greatest golfer&#x2014;some would argue the greatest athlete&#x2014;in modern history. But his story transcends golf, and his influence reached around the globe. Yet there has never been a comprehensive biography that offers a 360-degree look at Tiger&#x2019;s entire life to date, one that closely examines his roots and the vital role his parents played in his epic rise, fall, and return. After writing The System, a deep dive into the complex world of big-time college football, we were searching for another mountain to climb. We could think of none more imposing or ...</p><h2>The Reasons for Seasons</h2><p>How the position of Earth in relation to the sun causes seasons.</p><p>Here is an explanation of how the position of Earth in relation to the sun causes seasons, and the wonders that come with each one of them.Gail Gibbons has published close to fifty distinguished nonfiction titles with Holiday House.

Tour.</p><p>Paul Volcker and Toyoo Gyohten enjoyed remarkable careers as economic statesmen for the United States and Japan. Both Volcker, former Federal Reserve Board Chairman, and Gyohten, former vice minister for international affairs at the all-powerful Japanese Ministry of Finance, are graduates of Princeton who began their careers in the 1950s when the United States was beginning to assert itself as an economic superpower and Japan was still rebuilding after the war. <i>Changing Fortunes</i> is the recollections of Volcker and Gyohten about the international monetary affairs of the last four decades as seen from the American and Japanese perspectives.<p> The book, which is based on a series of lectures given at the Woodrow Wilson School, gives an inside view of all the significant economic events of the last four decades, including the formation of the new monetary system that was negotiated at Bretton Woods in 1944, the Latin American debt crisis of the 1970s, and the interest rate shocks of the late '70s and early '80s. Anyone interested in understanding the current state of world economic affairs will find <i>Changing Fortunes</i> an extremely useful primer. --<i>Harry C. Edwards</i></p>Insightful appraisals of the global monetary order from a pair of technocrats who played key roles in shaping its past, present, and future. This study grew out of a series of seminars at Princeton conducted by Volcker (former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board) and Gyohten (until his recent retirement, a senior official in Japan's Ministry of Finance) during the spring of 1991. Here, they take turns surveying the postwar history of the world's monetary system, from the Bretton Woods era of stable currencies through the latter-day problems caused by floating exchange rates. Along their way, the authors assess the impact of so-called oil shocks, the Smithsonian accord (which put paid to the gold standard), the Latin American debt crisis, and other landmark events. Covered as well is the emergence of Japan and Germany and its EC partners as economic powers to be reckoned with, and the relative decline of a once- dominant US. Volcker and Gyohten both tend to address their common subject in ways that conform to, if not confirm, national stereotypes. Throughout, the American is blunt, albeit fundamentally optimistic about prospects for the US and the wider world. By contrast, Gyohten, while candid about the altered state of the ties that still bind Japan and the US, is circumspect, even conciliatory, stressing the historic success of a grand alliance while soft-pedaling the uncertainties that cloud its future. The odd couple agree on any number of points--that strong currencies afford a competitive edge on the home front as well as in international commerce; that regional trading blocs could lead to undesirable protectionism; that monetary and fiscal policies must be coordinated on a supranational basis, etc. Illuminating and accessible perspectives on a topic of vital interest to us all. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

After the family had moved to Moscow in 1827 he entered Petersburg University where he studied philosophy. When he was nineteen he published his first poems and, convinced that Europe contained the source of real knowledge, went to the University of Berlin. After two years he returned to Russia and took his degree at the University of Moscow. In 1843 he fell in love with Pauline Garcia-Viardot, a young Spanish singer, who influenced the rest of his life; he followed her on her singing tours in Europe and spent long periods in the French house of herself and her husband, both of whom accepted him as a family friend. He sent his daughter by a sempstress to be brought up among the Viardot children. After 1856 he lived mostly abroad, and he became the first Russian writer to gain a wide reputation in Europe; he was a well-known figure in Parisian literary circles, where his friends included Flaubert and the Goncourt brothers, and an honorary degree was conferred on him at Oxford. His series of six novels reflect a period of Russian life from 1830s to the 1870s: they are&nbsp;<b>Rudin</b>&nbsp;(1855),<b>A House of Gentlefolk</b>&nbsp;(1858),&nbsp;<b>On the Eve</b>&nbsp;(1859; a Penguin Classic),&nbsp;<b>Fathers and Sons</b>&nbsp;(1861),&nbsp;<b>Smoke</b>(1867) and&nbsp;<b>Virgin Soil</b>&nbsp;(1876).

The CC prepares a series of artificial memories designed to explore Hildy's problem; but gradually Hildy learns that the CC itself has suicidal impulses (it's been forced to destroy several of its own subsystems). Indeed, the CC's problem may be causing Hildy's! Following a sex change, Hildy discovers that a crashed and apparently abandoned prototype starship actually contains a thriving colony of dissenters; they have made some startling scientific discoveries but fear becoming controlled by the CC, whose actions are growing ever more bizarre and dangerous. Though initially suspicious, ``Heinleiners'' come to trust Hildy, and explain their program (genetic research, interstellar flight, etc.). But then the CC--now insane, with ``good'' and ``evil'' aspects in conflict--attacks, intending to capture or kill Hildy. Hildy escapes, barely, while the CC is put out of action, and the child that Hildy has just given birth to dies. Sort of a Great Heinlein Memorial Novel--tediously so at times--hardworking and with flashes of wit, but weighed down with expository chat, a thin and contrived plot, and poorly defined characters. Once a prodigious talent, Varley has subsided into an overblown, obfuscatory mode that will disappoint all but his most ardent fans. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Lofts may not have skylights; many commercial spaces only have windows along one side; and, since sunlight provides the major source of illumination, industrial and more modern commercial spaces can be--and often are--downright dingy. <p> The dramatic, sprawling character of the open loft, while it might reflect the nonconformist artistic aspirations of its occupant, is just as often a practical necessity: partitions would get in the way of what precious light exists. Not only does <i>The International Book of Lofts</i> trace the rise of lofts--from practical workshops-cum-living spaces for artisans and artists to the self-important style statements of writers, fashion designers, and accountants--it is also a photographic compendium of solutions to the antagonistic problems of light, space, and privacy. Ranging widely from city to city, from minimalist temple to faux-Medici palazzo, the authors even find room to consider those purpose-built houses and apartments that borrow from the loft aesthetic. </p><p> The irritatingly precious text--of the sort that "tells" the planning of a space and "situates" its rooms--is minimal and of little importance anyway.

He outlines artistic trends in each period, linking them to economic, political and spiritual developments, and discusses the full range of artistic output: monumental architecture, sculpture, wall-reliefs and paintings, furniture, jewellery, papyri and pottery. He concludes with a fascinating account of Egypt&#39;s influence on modern art. Illustrations document the immense variety and superb quality of the art and architecture of one of the world&#39;s great civilizations.</p><p>Ancient Egyptian art has an enduring fascination. From the geometrical precision of the great pyramids at Giza to the golden treasures found in the tomb of Tutankhamun, the products of the Egyptian civilization attract and intrigue. Far from being art work in the modern sense, they represent the concrete expression of a profound belief in the primacy of the Egyptian way of life and the continuation of the spirit in the afterlife. This comprehensive book traces Egyptian art from its origins in prehistoric times through the supreme achievements of the pharaohs to the Roman period. Placing the works of art in their historical, geographical and spiritual context, Jaromir Malek seeks to create a more complete and realistic view of this fascinating culture. Beyond the period of ancient Egyptian art itself, Malek traces the history of Egyptology and looks at the influence of Egypt on modern art, a topic which has so far been almost completely ignored. Through its wealth of illustrations, this book reveals the immense variety and superb quality of the objects and buildings that have survived from ancient Egypt.Jaromir Malek is Keeper of the Archive at the Griffith Institute, Ashmolean Museum, Oxford.</p><h2>Monk&#39;s Hood</h2><p>When a visitor to the abbey dies, Brother Cadfael faces a personal drama.

It&#39;s a word we all love to hear. But do we all know what it means? Without it, our lives are dry and dusty. But when grace comes, it transforms our lives into something rich and beautiful. With remarkable insight gleaned from his own life, Pastor Chuck Smith unfolds the mystery of grace and reveals the surprising truth: We can never grow in grace by our own efforts. True grace flows from the heart of the Father through the love of Jesus Christ. To know that God is for you, that He loves you, is the greatest source of security you will ever know. That is grace-and that is what makes life worth living.</p><p>Chuck Smith was the founder of the Calvary Chapel Movement, and taught the Bible for more than sixty years.

Opening with a 1737 attack by a critic who labeled Bach a pedant who spoiled the natural beauty of his creations with "an excess of art," Christoph Wolff cogently compares the German composer to English scientist Isaac Newton. Both men "brought about fundamental changes and established new principles" in their chosen fields, he argues; both sought to reveal God's harmonious ordering of their world. While Wolff conscientiously covers the basics of Bach's life, including his two marriages and the musical achievements of his gifted family, the author's primary focus is on his performing (Bach was an unrivaled organist) and composing. From the <i>Goldberg Variations</i> through the <i>Brandenburg Concertos</i> to <i>Art of the Fugue</i>, Wolff carefully analyzes Bach's innovations in harmony and counterpoint, placing them in the context of European musical and social history rendered in nicely atmospheric detail. Casual readers may find this dense tome a bit daunting, but serious music lovers will relish the deeper understanding it conveys of a genius who transformed Western music. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>Christoph Wolff is William Powell Mason Professor of Music and dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at Harvard University. He is the author of Bach: Essays on His Life and Music.</p><h2>Freud: A Life for Our Time</h2><p>Probes the professional and personal life of one of this century&#39;s most influential thinkers, analyzing Freud&#39;s disputes with his students, his life in relation to the troubles of his native Austria, and his controversial love life</p><p>Gay's engrossing portrait of Freud is unconventional, at times startling. We see how a doting, domineering mother equipped young Sigmund for a life of intrepid investigation. We follow the ambitious medical student's long, sexually starved courtship of Martha Bernays, a romance that, according to Gay, influenced his theories about the sexual roots of mental ailments. Freud continually analyzed his own unresolved conflicts, blaming his fainting spells on unconscious homosexual urges. Though he preached that the psychoanalyst should be detached during therapy sessions, he bent and even broke his own rules, returning fees to patients who fell on hard times and making friends with his favorite analysands. Perhaps no biographer has succeeded as well as Gay in linking Freud's life to his writings and his times. In this magisterial biography by the eminent cultural historian (The Bourgeois Experience, etc.), Freud's greatness and his flaws flow out of the same stubborn, obsessive quest for truth. Photos not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.This simply wonderful book will take its place among the definitive biographies of Freud. The author, an historian and superb writer with psychoanalytical training, has written extensively on Freud and the era in which he worked. While clearly partial to Freud, Gay gives a far more balanced and at times critical account of his life than Ernest Jones's very orthodox The Life &amp; Work of Sigmund Freud and hence will provide a far more valuable refutation of works hostile to Freud. Outstanding features include the in-depth, lucid discussion of Freud's major works and masterful evocation of the epoch that ended in the terror of Nazi-occupied Vienna. Accessible and entertaining as well as comprehensive and technically rigorous; a great addition to the field.

Since that time, he's written dozens of novels in several genres, notably the award-winning <i>The Haunting of Alaizabel Cray</i>; <i>Poison</i>; <i>Storm Thief</i>; the Malice series; and the graphic novel, <i>Pandemonium</i>.<b>Praise for <i>Malice</i>:</b> <p> "The creative formatting, fast pace and classic horror elements will surely satisfy any teen who likes a good scare." -<i>Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books</i> </p><p> "The fast-paced storyline and whimsically dangerous setting will capture plenty of attention.

He or she must have a working knowledge of how the various technical aspects of the theater work (scenery, props, costumes, lights and sound), be part director, part playwright, part designer and part producer, and be prepared to act as confidant, counselor and confessor to everyone else in the company.<br><br>This book addresses all of these considerations in detail and offers the reader&#x2013;professional or amateur, veteran or beginner&#x2013;helpful guidance and practical advice, supported by many forms and examples to illustrate the points covered in the text.<br><br>The three phrases of mounting and performing a show are covered. Part I takes the reader through the pre-production phase&#x2013;research, the script, planning and organization, and auditions. Part II covers the rehearsal process&#x2013;rehearsal rules, blocking, cues, prompting, information distribution, technical and dress rehearsals. Part III discusses the performance phase&#x2013;calling the show, maintaining the director's work, working with understudies and replacements, and more.<br><br>Part IV provides insights into the organizational structure or some theaters and aspects of human behavior in those organizations. Many stage managers of long-running commercial productions believe that&#x2013;once the show is up and running&#x2013;only ten percent of their work is related to everything covered in Parts I, II and III. The other ninety percent is associated with issues in Part IV; i.e. "managing" human behavior and maintaining working relationships.</p><p>Ionazzi (productions, UCLA School of Theatre) offers this textbook for stage managers and stage management classes. It is arranged logically in four parts following the chronology of production. The last section is devoted to organizational behavior, an area not often developed in such texts. An especially useful section is the appendix containing a dozen clear and useful blank forms. Keeping paper flowing smoothly is an art the text emphasizes. The book is readable and provides many examples, with plenty of graphic illustration. Its major drawback is that it does not address the stage manager's professional union responsibilities. It is not as detailed as Lawrence Stern's similar Stage Management (Allyn &amp; Bacon, 1992. 4th ed.), but it contains a good bibliography. This workable introduction to the stage manager's craft is recommended for academic and large public libraries.<br><i>- Thomas E.

If you are looking for a way to deepen, renew, or discover for the first time the profound meaning of this time of year in a way that strengthens your faith, this book is for you. I would highly recommend it.<br><b>&#x2014;Pastor Janet Hunt</b>&nbsp;<br><br><p>Every year the&nbsp;<i>holiday season</i>&nbsp;comes earlier. Coffee cups, mall Santas, ornaments, Christmas music and grocery-store-eggnog all proclaim the yuletide cheer as the retail industrial complex screams, &#x201c;Happy Holidays!&#x201d; The Christian tradition has its own way of preparing for the holidays: Advent (beginning this year on November 29). More than just a time for marking the shopping days before Christmas, Advent is about preparing your heart to enter fully into the mystery of God&#x2019;s coming to us in the Incarnation of Christ.<br> If you are familiar with any of these authors, you know how deeply they have reflected on the spiritual life and the wealth of insights they have for waiting and watching well. &nbsp;This is really a beautiful book and one of my &#x2018;holiday favorites.&#x2019; &nbsp;I read a library copy several years ago and am happy to delve back into it for this season. Five stars, for sure. Now is the time to start thinking about how to wait well. Paraclete Press has several devotional resources designed to help us enter into the seasons of Advent, Christmas and Epiphany.&nbsp;<i>God With Us: Reader&#x2019;s Edition&nbsp;</i>of&nbsp;a paperback version of one of my favorites. Like its companion volume&nbsp;<i>God for Us&nbsp;</i>(which walks through Lent and Easter), it brings together a group of writers from across the Christian tradition (Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant&#x2013;in both Evangelical and Mainline), under the editorial gaze of&nbsp;<b>Greg Pennoyer</b>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<b>Gregory Wolfe</b>&nbsp;(from Image Journal).&nbsp;<b>Eugene Peterson</b>&nbsp;writes the introduction and four authors each write a weeks' worth of devotions for each day of Advent. The late&nbsp;<b>Richard John Neuhaus</b>&nbsp;provided the devotions for week one. Poets&nbsp;<b>Scott Cairns</b>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<b>Lucy Shaw</b>&nbsp;write the devotions for weeks two and three, respectively. Memoirist&nbsp;<b>Kathleen Norris&#x2019;s</b>&nbsp;offerings make up week four, leading up to Christmas while&nbsp;<b>Emilie Griffin</b>&nbsp;reflects on the special days between Christmas and the feast of Epiphany. Punctuating each section is&nbsp;<b>Beth Bevis</b>&#x2018;s brief histories share the historical context of the church&#x2019;s practice of the season and various feast days.<b>&#x2014;</b><b>James Matichuk</b></p><br>This is a beautiful Advent devotional book in its 4th printing. This quote is from the preface by the author "Christmas is the feast of the Incarnation, which is the mystery of God with us in the flesh. When we cut through the sentiment and marketing to the spiritual riches of Christmas , we recover not only a sense of who God is, but also who we are as human beings." I like the format of the book with the unpacking of the scriptures for the four weeks of Advent followed by Christmas to Epiphany. The history of the feast days by Beth Davis was very informational and I learned a lot about each of the 12 days of Christmas has history and has a specific meaning and purpose. I like the variety of authors from Richard Neuhaus to Kathleen Norris. I did not like that the scripture readings were cited at the beginning of each chapter and not included for convenient reading. I guess I'm just showing laziness, maybe this is made to make the average reader seek out their bible for the readings. Advent is a special time for the church and for me personally. We are an incarnational people where the gift of ourselves is important for the season because of God's gift of himself not just on the cross but by the stable manger. This quote from <i>God with Us</i> "Christmas is about incarnation, and incarnation is God&#x2019;s becoming what he is not, in order that we might become what he is. Thus does God reveal himself" is a powerful affirmation of our humanity. I would recommend this book to deepen your experience of this spiritual season. From the book is the best recommendation "As this season of preparation continues, Holy God who is with us, may we lean into every moment of our days to redeem the time, to make the most of our every moment."<b>&#x2014;Patricia McKenna</b></p><h2>Christine Falls (Quirke)</h2><p>In the debut crime novel from the Booker-winning author, a Dublin pathologist follows the corpse of a mysterious woman into the heart of <br>a conspiracy among the city's high Catholic society &nbsp;It's not the dead that seem strange to Quirke. It's the living. One night, after a few drinks at an office party, Quirke shuffles down into the morgue where he works and finds his brother-in-law, Malachy, altering a file he has no business even reading. Odd enough in itself to find Malachy there, but the next morning, when the haze has lifted, it looks an awful lot like his brother-in-law, the esteemed doctor, was in fact tampering with a corpse--and concealing the cause of death.<br>It turns out the body belonged to a young woman named Christine Falls. And as Quirke reluctantly presses on toward the true facts behind her death, he comes up against some insidious--and very well-guarded--secrets of Dublin's high Catholic society, among them members of his own family.<br>Set in Dublin and Boston in the 1950s, the first novel in the Quirke series brings all the vividness and psychological insight of Booker Prize winner John Banville's fiction to a thrilling, atmospheric crime story.

His novels have won numerous awards, most recently the Man Booker Prize in 2005 for The Sea. He lives in Dublin.Chapter One&nbsp;It was not the dead that seemed to quirke uncanny but the living. When he walked into the morgue long after midnight and saw Malachy Griffin there he felt a shiver along his spine that was to prove prophetic, a tremor of troubles to come. Mal was in Quirke's office, sitting at the desk. Quirke stopped in the unlit body room, among the shrouded forms on their trolleys, and watched him through the open doorway. He was seated with his back to the door, leaning forward intently in his steel-framed spectacles, the desk lamp lighting the left side of his face and making an angry pink glow through the shell of his ear. He had a file open on the desk before him and was writing in it with peculiar awkwardness. This would have struck Quirke as stranger than it did if he had not been drunk. The scene sparked a memory in him from their school days together, startlingly clear, of Mal, intent like this, sitting at a desk among fifty other earnest students in a big hushed hall, as he laboriously composed an examination essay, with a beam of sunlight falling slantways on him from a window somewhere high above. A quarter of a century later he still had that smooth seal's head of oiled black hair, scrupulously combed and parted.&nbsp;Sensing a presence behind him, Mal turned his face and peered into the shadowy dark of the body room. Quirke waited a moment and then stepped forward, with some unsteadiness, into the light in the doorway.&nbsp;"Quirke," Mal said, recognizing him with relief and giving an exasperated sigh. "For God's sake."&nbsp;Mal was in evening clothes but uncharacteristically unbuttoned, his bow tie undone and the collar of his white dress shirt open. Quirke, groping in his pockets for his cigarettes, contemplated him, noting the way he put his forearm quickly over the file to hide it, and was reminded again of school.&nbsp;"Working late?" Quirke said, and grinned crookedly, the alcohol allowing him to think it a telling piece of wit.&nbsp;"What are you doing here?" Mal said, too loudly, ignoring the question. He pushed the spectacles up the damp bridge of his nose with a tap of a fingertip. He was nervous.&nbsp;Quirke pointed to the ceiling. "Party," he said. "Upstairs."&nbsp;Mal assumed his consultant's face, frowning imperiously. "Party? What party?"&nbsp;"Brenda Ruttledge," Quirke said. "One of the nurses. Her going-away."&nbsp;Mal's frown deepened. "Ruttledge?"&nbsp;Quirke was suddenly bored. He asked if Mal had a cigarette, for he seemed to have none of his own, but Mal ignored this question too. He stood up, deftly sweeping the file with him, still trying to hide it under his arm. Quirke, though he had to squint, saw the name scrawled in large handwritten letters on the cover of it: Christine Falls. Mal's fountain pen was on the desk, a Parker, fat and black and shiny, with a gold nib, no doubt, twenty-two karat, or more if it was possible; Mal had a taste for rich things, it was one of his few weaknesses.&nbsp;"How is Sarah?" Quirke asked. He let himself droop sideways heavily until his shoulder found the support of the doorjamb. He felt dizzy, and everything was keeping up a flickering, leftward lurch. He was at the rueful stage of having drunk too much and knowing that there was nothing to be done but wait until the effects wore off. Mal had his back to him, putting the file into a drawer of the tall gray filing cabinet.&nbsp;"She's well," Mal said. "We were at a Knights dinner. I sent her home in a taxi."&nbsp;"Knights?" Quirke said, widening his eyes blearily.&nbsp;Mal turned to him a blank, expressionless look, the lenses of his glasses flashing. "Of St. Patrick. As if you didn't know."&nbsp;"Oh," Quirke said. "Right." He looked as if he were trying not to laugh. "Anyway," he said, "never mind about me, what are you doing, down here among the dead men?"&nbsp;Mal had a way of bulging out his eyes and drawing upward sinuously his already long, thin form, as if to the music of a snake charmer's flute. Quirke had to marvel, not for the first time, at the polished luster of that hair, the smoothness of the brow beneath, the untarnished steely blue of his eyes behind the pebble glass of his specs.&nbsp;"I had a thing to do," Mal said. "A thing to check."&nbsp;"What thing?"&nbsp;Mal did not answer. He studied Quirke and saw how drunk he was, and a cold glint of relief came into his eye.&nbsp;"You should go home," he said.&nbsp;Quirke thought to dispute this--the morgue was his territory--but again suddenly he lost all interest. He shrugged, and with Mal still watching him he turned and weaved away among the body-bearing trolleys. Halfway across the room he stumbled and reached out quickly to the edge of a trolley to steady himself but managed only to grab the sheet, which came away in his hand in a hissing white flash. He was struck by the clammy coldness of the nylon; it had a human feel, like a loose, chill cowl of bloodless skin. The corpse was that of a young woman, slim and yellow-haired; she had been pretty, but death had robbed her of her features and now she might be a carving in soapstone, primitive and bland. Something, his pathologist's instinct perhaps, told him what the name would be before he looked at the label tied to her toe. "Christine Falls," he murmured. "You were well named." Looking more closely he noticed the dark roots of her hair at forehead and temples: dead, and not even a real blonde.&nbsp;He woke hours later, curled on his side, with a vague but pressing sense of imminent disaster. He had no memory of lying down here, among the corpses. He was chilled to the bone, and his tie was askew and choking him. He sat up, clearing his throat; how much had he drunk, first in McGonagle's and then at the party upstairs? The door to his office stood open--surely it was a dream that Mal had been there? He swung his legs to the floor and gingerly stood upright. He was light-headed, as if the top of his skull had been lifted clear off. Raising an arm, he gravely saluted the trolleys, Roman-style, and walked stiffly at a tilt out of the room.&nbsp;The walls of the corridor were matte green and the woodwork and the radiators were thick with many coats of a bilious yellow stuff, glossy and glutinous, less like paint than crusted gruel. He paused at the foot of the incongruously grand, sweeping staircase--the building had been originally a club for Regency rakes--and was surprised to hear faint sounds of revelry still filtering down from the fifth floor. He put a foot on the stair, a hand on the banister rail, but paused again. Junior doctors, medical students, nurses beef to the heel: no, thanks, enough of that, and besides, the younger men had not wanted him there in the first place. He moved on along the corridor. He had a premonition of the hangover that was waiting for him, mallet and tongs at the ready. In the night porter's room beside the tall double doors of the main entrance a wireless set was quietly playing to itself. The Ink Spots. Quirke hummed the tune to himself. It's a sin to tell a lie. Well, that was certainly true.&nbsp;When he came out onto the steps the porter was there in his brown dust coat, smoking a cigarette and contemplating a surly dawn breaking behind the dome of the Four Courts. The porter was a dapper little fellow with glasses and dusty hair and a pointed nose that twitched at the tip. In the still-dark street a motorcar oozed past.&nbsp;"Morning, Porter," Quirke said.&nbsp;The porter laughed. "You know the name's not Porter, Mr. Quirke," he said. The way that tuft of dry brown hair was brushed back fiercely from his forehead gave him a look of permanent, vexed surmise. A querulous mouse of a man.&nbsp;"That's right," Quirke said, "you're the porter, but you're not Porter." Behind the Four Courts now a dark-blue cloud with an aspect of grim intent had begun edging its way up the sky, eclipsing the light of an as yet unseen sun. Quirke turned up the collar of his jacket, wondering vaguely what had become of the raincoat he seemed to remember wearing when he had started drinking, many hours ago. And what had become of his cigarette case? "Have you a cigarette itself to lend me?" he said.&nbsp;The porter produced a packet. "They're only Woodbines, Mr. Quirke."&nbsp;Quirke took the cigarette and bent over the cupped flame of his lighter, savoring the brief, flabby reek of burning petrol. He lifted his face to the sky and breathed deep the acrid smoke. How delicious it was, the day's first searing lungful. The lid of the lighter chinked as he flipped it shut. Then he had to cough, making a tearing sound in his throat.&nbsp;"Christ, Porter," he said, his voice wobbling, "how can you smoke these things? Any day now I'll have you on the slab in there. When I open you up your lights will look like kippers."&nbsp;The porter laughed again, a forced, breathy titter. Quirke brusquely walked away from him. As he descended the steps he felt in the nerves of his back the fellow's suddenly laughless eye following him with ill intent. What he did not feel was another, melancholy gaze angled down upon him from a lighted window five stories above, where vague, festive forms were weaving and dipping still.&nbsp;Drifts of soundless summer rain were graying the trees in Merrion Square. Quirke hurried along, keeping close to the railings as if they might shelter him, the lapels of his jacket clutched tight to his throat. It was too early yet for the office workers, and the broad street was deserted, with not a car in sight, and if not for the rain he would have been able to see unhindered all the way to the Peppercanister Church, which always looked to him, viewed from a distance like this down the broad, shabby sweep of Upper Mount Street, to be set at a slightly skewed angle. Among the clustered chimneys a few were dribbling smoke; the summer was almost over, a new chill was in the air. But who had lit those fires, so early? Could there still be scullery maids to haul the coal bucket up from the basement before first light? He eyed the tall windows, thinking of all those shadowed rooms with people in them, waking, yawning, getting up to make their breakfasts, or turning over to enjoy another half hour in the damp, warm stew of their beds. Once, on another summer dawn, going along here like this, he had heard faintly from one of those windows a woman's cries of ecstasy fluttering down into the street. What a piercing stab of pity he had felt for himself then, walking all alone here, before everyone else's day had begun; piercing, and pained, but pleasurable, too, for in secret Quirke prized his loneliness as a mark of some distinction.&nbsp;In the hallway of the house there was the usual smell he could never identify, brownish, exhausted, a breath out of childhood, if childhood was the word for that first decade of misery he had suffered through. He plodded up the stairs with the tread of a man mounting the gallows, his sodden shoes squelching. He had reached the first-floor return when he heard a door down in the hall opening; he stopped, sighed.&nbsp;"Terrible racket again last night," Mr. Poole called up accusingly. "Not a wink."&nbsp;Quirke turned. Poole stood sideways in the barely open doorway of his flat, neither in nor out, his accustomed stance, with an expression at once truculent and timid. He was an early riser, if indeed he ever slept. He wore a sleeveless pullover and a dicky-bow, twill trousers sharply creased, gray carpet slippers. He looked, Quirke always thought, like the father of a fighter pilot in one of those Battle of Britain films or, better still, the father of the fighter pilot's girlfriend.&nbsp;"Good morning, Mr. Poole," Quirke said, politely distant; the fellow was often a source of light relief, but Quirke's mood this early morning was not light.&nbsp;Poole's pale gull's eye glittered vengefully. He had a way of grinding his lower jaw from side to side.&nbsp;"All night, no letup," he said, aggrieved. The other flats in the house were vacant, save for Quirke's on the third floor, yet Poole regularly complained of noises in the night. "Frightful carry-on, bang bang bang."&nbsp;Quirke nodded. "Terrible. I was out, myself."&nbsp;Poole glanced back into the room behind him, looked up at Quirke again. "It's the missus that minds," he said, lowering his voice to a whisper, "not me." This was a new twist. Mrs. Poole, rarely glimpsed, was a diminutive person with a furtive, frightened stare; she was, Quirke knew for a fact, profoundly deaf. "I've lodged a strong complaint. I shall expect action, I told them."&nbsp;"Good for you."&nbsp;Poole narrowed his eyes, suspecting irony. "We'll see," he said menacingly. "We'll see."&nbsp;Quirke walked on up the stairs. He was at his own door before he heard Poole closing his.&nbsp;Chill air stood unwelcoming in the living room, where the rain murmured against the two high windows, relics of a richer age, which no matter how dull the day were always somehow filled with a muted radiance Quirke found mysteriously dispiriting. He opened the lid of a silver cigarette box on the mantelpiece, but it was empty. He knelt on one knee and with difficulty lit the gas fire from the small flame of his cigarette lighter. With disgust he noted his dry raincoat, thrown over the back of an armchair, where it had been all the time. He rose to his feet too quickly and for a moment saw stars. When his vision cleared he was facing a photograph in a tortoiseshell frame on the mantelpiece: Mal Griffin, Sarah, himself at the age of twenty, and his future wife, Delia, laughingly pointing her racquet at the camera, all of them in tennis whites, walking forward arm in arm into a glare of sunlight. He realized with a faint shock that he could not remember where the picture had been taken; Boston, he supposed, it must have been Boston--but had they played tennis in Boston?&nbsp;He took off his damp suit, put on a dressing gown, and sat down barefoot before the gas fire. He looked about the big, high-ceilinged room and grinned joylessly: his books, his prints, his Turkey carpet--his life. In the foothills of his forties, he was a decade younger than the century. The 1950s had promised a new age of prosperity and happiness for all; they were not living up to their promise. His eye settled on an artist's articulated wooden model, a foot high, standing on the low telephone table beside the window, its jointed limbs arranged in a prancing pose. He looked away, frowning, but then with a sigh of annoyance rose and went and twisted the figure into a stance of desolate abasement that would better suit his morning gloom and burgeoning hangover. He returned to the chair and sat down again. The rain ceased and there was silence but for the sibilant hiss of the gas flame. His eyes scalded, they felt as if they had been boiled; he closed them, and shivered as the lids touched, imparting to each other along their inflamed edges a tiny, horrible kiss. Clearly in his mind he saw again that moment in the photograph: the grass, the sunlight, the great hot trees, and the four of them striding forward, young and svelte and smiling. Where was it? Where? And who h...</p><h2>All the Presidents&#39; Pastries: Twenty-Five Years in the White House, A Memoir</h2><p>This extraordinary success-story-told by the hero himself-of a young French pastry chef who climbed his way to the top, embodies the great American dream.

For most of this time, she's suffered the mixed blessing of being a "writer's writer"--somebody with a fanatic following within the literary community and near invisibility outside of it. With <i>Women in Their Beds</i>, however, Berriault seems finally to be receiving the recognition she's always deserved. The book--a greatest hits collection that includes nine new stories--has already won the National Book Critics Circle Award, the PEN/Faulkner Award, and the Rea Foundation Prize. Lyrical, concise, and stubbornly resistant to secondhand wisdom, these stories are (in the words of Richard Ford) "nonpareil [and] just simply wonderful."Whether focusing on yuppies or drifters, social workers or Indian restaurateurs, heroin addicts or teenage baby-sitters, Berriault (The Lights of Earth) writes with great psychological acuity and a compassion that comes always from observation, never from sentimentality. These 35 short stories have been published in magazines ranging from the Paris Review to Harper's Bazaar; 10 of them are here issued in book form for the first time. In "Who Is It Can Tell Me Who I Am?" the dapper Alberto Perera, "a librarian who did not look like one," fears that the young drifter who has befriended him, wishing to discuss the Spanish poetry he carries in his pockets, is out to kill him; but the drifter is only trying to understand how?both literally and philosophically?to live. A 79-year-old psychologist woos a young, pragmatic waitress in "The Infinite Passion of Expectation." When she meets his ex-wife and witnesses the selfishness spawned by a life spent in deferment, she flees. In the clever "The Search for J. Kruper," an extremely famous and narcissistic novelist, noted for writing grand, poorly disguised autobiographical confessions, learns of the possible whereabouts of one of the few remaining living novelists as famous as he, a recluse who betrays nothing of himself in his writings. Each story is constructed so gracefully that it's easy to overlook how carefully crafted Berriault's writing is.

Most know Richard Feynman for the hilarious anecdotes and exploits in his best-selling books <em>Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!</em> and <em>What DoYou&nbsp;Care What Other People Think?</em> But not always obvious in those stories was his brilliance as a pure scientist&#x2015;one of the century's greatest physicists. With this book and CD, we hear the voice of the great Feynman in all his ingenuity, insight, and acumen for argument. This breathtaking lecture&#x2015;"The Motion of the Planets Around the Sun"&#x2015;uses nothing more advanced than high-school geometry to explain why the planets orbit the sun elliptically rather than in perfect circles, and conclusively demonstrates the astonishing fact that has mystified and intrigued thinkers since Newton: Nature obeys mathematics. David and Judith Goodstein give us a beautifully written short memoir of life with Feynman, provide meticulous commentary on the lecture itself, and relate the exciting story of their effort to chase down one of Feynman's most original and scintillating lectures.</p><p>Richard Feynman, the rock star of theoretical physics, has left an image that belies his nerdy side. Not many bongo-playing surfer beatniks would have spent hours of their spare time proving Newton's law of elliptical planetary motion using only plane geometry. But <i>Feynman's Lost Lecture: The Motion of Planets Around the Sun</i> shows that the great man did just that. Originally delivered to an introductory physics class at Caltech in 1963, this 76-minute CD and book set contains everything the math-savvy listener needs to savor the pleasures of applied math. Caltech physicist David L. Goodstein and archivist Judith R. Goodstein found the notes and tape amid another professor's papers and set to work making sense of them; unfortunately, photographs of the blackboard drawings didn't survive. The book briefly covers their find and recovery work, then presents the proof as reconstructed--crucial reading if one is to follow the lecture. There's nothing easy about it, as Feynman acknowledges in the lecture: <blockquote> I am going to give what I will call an elementary demonstration. "Elementary" means that very little is required to know ahead of time in order to understand it, except to have an infinite amount of intelligence. </blockquote> He means, instead, that he is strictly using geometrical methods to reach his destination, which explains why it was so difficult to reconstruct without his diagrams. His charming Brooklyn accent and good humor show through in this lecture, even if the material is quite a bit drier than his fans might expect. Still, those interested in adding a new dimension to their understanding of this brilliant scientist--and those with a deep interest in Newtonian physics--will find <i>The Motion of Planets Around the Sun</i> a rare and unexpected treat. <i>--Rob Lightner</i>On March 13, 1964, Feynman delivered a lecture to the Caltech freshman class, &#34;The Motion of Planets Around the Sun&#34;why the planets move elliptically instead of in perfect circles. For reasons unknown, most probably for his own amusement, he chose to make the argument using mathematics no more advanced than high-school plane geometry. Isaac Newton had pulled off much the same trick nearly 300 years earlier in his masterpiece, the Principia. Feynman, unable to follow Newton&#39;s obscure proof, invented his own original, geometrical proof in the Caltech lecture. The subject of Feynman&#39;s lecture was the watershed discovery that separated the ancient world discovery that separated the ancient world from the modern world - the culmination of the Scientific Revolution. Before Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, and Newton, the universe was Earth-centered. After their discoveries, our idea of the universe steadily altered and expanded, moving outward to the infinity we try to understand in our own time. Thus Feynman deals here with a crowning achievement of the human mind, comparable to Beethoven&#39;s symphonies. Shakespeare&#39;s plays, or Michelangelo&#39;s Sistine Chapel. Feynman conclusively demonstrates the astonishing fact that has mystified and intrigued all deep thinkers since Newton&#39;s time: Nature obeys mathematics. For thirty years this brilliant and seminal lecture lay dormant in the Caltech archives. Now, in this book, Feynman&#39;s lost lecture has been reconstructed and explained in meticulous detail together with a history of ideas of the planets&#39; motions. Anyone who remembers high-school geometry can enjoy it and can profit from the compact disc that accompanies this book.</p><h2>Spirit of Fire: The Life and Vision of Teilhard De Chardin</h2><p>Spirit of Fire is a popular biography of one of this century's most fascinating religious figures. Pierre Teilhard de Chardin (1881-1955) was a Jesuit theologian, mystic, and scientist renowned for his pioneering field work in geology, paleontology, and human origins. His writings have inspired an international host of Teilhard societies. He was also a prophet in the expanding dialogue between religion, science, and, mysticism. In his views of humanity, divinity, and the universe Teilhard anticipated the echotheology of Thomas Berry and the creation spirituality of Matthew Fox.<br>As recounted in Spirit of Fire Teilhard's life intertwined a passionate intellect with spiritual adventure, a life of exploration of both the physical world and the soul. Steeped in the evolutionary views of contemporary science, Teilhard wrote with a rarely matched power of the real presence of God in the world. As King writes, Teilhard was a man "in love with the world, the world as a vast, living, tangible organism in which human beings belong as an integral part, and he was in love with God whose creative energy and living spirit pulsate throughout everthing that is."</p><p>Teilhard de Chardin, a 20th-century Jesuit priest and paleontologist, is a favorite theologian of contemporary notables such as Al Gore, Mario Cuomo, Marshall McCluhan, and cyberguru John Perry Barlow. Cuomo has said, "Teilhard made negativism a sin. He taught us how the whole universe--even pain and imperfection--is sacred." Ursula King, in <i>Spirit of Fire: The Life and Vision of Teilhard de Chardin</i>, has written an accessible, entertaining, and lavishly illustrated biography of Teilhard. His writings were all but ignored during his lifetime, but now serve as a lifeline for people of faith struggling to define divine imperatives for ecological responsibility and technological engagement.Ursula King is Professor Emerita and Senior Research Fellow at the University of Bristol.</p><h2>The Bones of Makaidos (Volume 4) (Oracles of Fire)</h2><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A wall of fire protects the inexperienced villagers of Second Eden from a planned invasion of dragons and Nephilim, but how long will the flames last?

This booka combination of travelogue, scientific report and mysteryis an arresting account of his search for poisons and antidotes presumably used to create zombis, the victims usually selected by a secret society tribunal. Analysis revealed that the poisons contain a substance that lowers the metabolic rate almost to the point of clinical death, from which, with the help of sorcerers, bodies may be raised from the grave. Vodoun priests, witnesses and alleged zombisone of whom Davis metmaintained that the victims of such unnatural deaths are often turned into robot-like slaves. How Davis gained access to the all-powerful network of secret societies similar to those of West Africa, witnessed and even participated in their meetings provides the final key to the zombi mystery. First serial to Omni. January 6<br>Copyright 1985 Reed Business Information, Inc.The book is an anecdotal and personal account by Davis, an ethnobotanist who pursued research on zombification in Haiti. During the course of several field trips, Davis discovered the neuropharmacological properties of plant and animal substances that explain how zombies are made. Davis also became enmeshed in the social web of Haitian society and depicts the historical forces that led to the intertwined relationships between cults and secret societies on the one hand, and the government on the other. The book lacks the kind of completeness that might be of interest to anthropologists, ethnobotanists, and medical specialists; it is more of a personal narrative, a diary of discovery, interesting to the public at large, but leaving specialists with a number of unanswered questions.

In Hollywood</h2><p><b>Lights, camera, action! Waldo's in Tinseltown and he's never had so much fun!</b><br><br>Hey, Waldo fans! Sharpen your eyes and your wits, because Waldo is taking you on a star-studded adventure. That's right, you're going to Hollywood! Follow Waldo &#x2014; if you can find him &#x2014; through a cast of thousands on the bustling streets of the great movie classics. Is he there in the chorus line of that musical in production, or up on the ramparts of that epic war film? Or is our elusive, bespectacled hero right in the middle of the swashbuckling escapades of the Three Musketeers?</p><p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>He's back--and as enticingly elusive as ever. Here the bespectacled wanderer travels to Tinseltown to hide out on 12 actor- and crew-packed movie sets. Among the epic productions he witnesses are a reenactment of a battle between the Trojans and the Greeks; the tale of Ali Baba and the 40-plus thieves; the adventures of the (many more than three) musketeers; and a grand skirmish between Robin Hood's myriad merry men and the soldiers of Nottingham Castle. In addition to Waldo (who is usually visible only from the neck up), Wenda, Wizard Whitebeard, bad-guy Odlaw and Woof ("Remember, all you can see is his tail!") are also artfully camouflaged on each riotous spread--as are a minuscule scroll, bone, key and can of film. Handford outdoes himself in the oversize volume's final scene, depicting the filming of "Where's Waldo? The Musical," which entails a stageful of one genuine--and countless impostors of--Waldo and each of his colleagues. Filled with witty puns and plays on Hollywood cliches, Handford's trademark checklists of "lots more things for Waldo-watchers to look for" conclude this clever book. Allegedly three years in the making, this production was worth waiting for.

(A character making an off-stage appearance in <i>Consumed</i> is Sagawa, the true-life necrophiliac and murderer who cannibalized a woman in Paris and became a Tokyo celebrity after his extradition and release. He went on to write restaurant reviews. All of which makes Cronenberg&#x2019;s deliriously serpentine narrative more than plausible.) Yet Consumed is a companion to those weltanschauungs, in that it rapturously finger-paints the hallucinatory avalanche of information in our time and how we enter the river of streaming data to emerge from those waters consecrated in the New Dream&#x2014;the scary, brave old world of unfathomable morphing realities. In this way it resembles Borges&#x2019; prophetic &#x201c;Internet&#x201d; story, &#x201c;Tl�n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius&#x201d; and even &#x201c;The insects of M.C. Escher&#x201d; (cf. <i>Cultural Entomology Digest</i>. As in many of the great director&#x2019;s explorations, insects buzz large in <i>Consumed</i> as well). This novel is ultimately about the human scanner devouring image and text, thus becoming transformed. Like the Ouroboros symbol of the snake consuming its tail, the reader of fiction chases and eats what inexorably becomes its (our) own Tale; the reader-cannibal of Consumed rips out the beating art of the reflected warrior and becomes a hyperlink. One of the characters muses, &#x201c;But also we realized we needed the net in order to understand what was the basic human condition, what a current human being really was, because we had lost touch with that, our students made that clear to us, and so we were also using the Internet to research our roles playing normal human beings.&#x201d;</p> <p><i>L&#x2019;Internet, c&#x2019;est nous</i>. What else is nous?</p> <p>Aside from all that, <i>Consumed</i> is great fun&#x2014;a blistering read, crazy sexy, and insanely funny, too. The charismatic celebrity-philosopher couple at its center is C�lestine and Aristide Arosteguy&#x2014;a hilarious riff on Sartre and de Beauvoir; why hasn&#x2019;t anyone done this before?&#x2014;and a pair of young journalists/lovers who fatefully converge to unravel C�lestine&#x2019;s mysterious murder in Paris. (A few of the Arosteguy&#x2019;s lauded works are <i>Science-Fiction Money, Apocalyptic Consumerism: A User&#x2019;s Manual, and Labor Gore: Marx and Horror</i>.) They sleep with their student-acolytes and as faces of the theory of &#x201c;Evolutionary Consumerism&#x201d; are heroes on the world stage. Listen to C�lestine: &#x201c;When you no longer have any desire, you are dead. Even desire for a product, a consumer item, is better than no desire at all. You can see this in the youngest babies. Their desire is fierce. That&#x2019;s why we say that the only authentic literature of the modern era is the owner&#x2019;s manual.&#x201d;</p> <p> A hilarious sequence takes place at the Cannes Film Festival, where the Arosteguys are on the jury for the main competition. (Cronenberg himself was famously awarded the Special Jury prize for <i>Crash</i> in 1996, for &#x201c;audacity,&#x201d; and was President of the festival Jury in 1999.) This section is as pitch perfect as anything of Edward St. Aubyn&#x2019;s in his recent satire of the Man Booker, <i>Lost for Words</i>. &#x201c;We were on the jury at the Cannes Film Festival,&#x201d; recounts Aristide, &#x201c;the only two members who were not moviemaking professionals. The year before, it had been an American opera singer and a computer-game designer. Sequestered in a deluxe villa in the hills overlooking Cannes, we were to discuss in the most leisurely and free-form manner all questions of cinema and society with our nine jury colleagues&#x2014;including our president, the Serbian actor Dragan &#x160;timac&#x2014;while eating the most exquisite meals and wandering the most Arcadian gardens. . . . There was on our jury an aged, angry, exiled North Korean director, Bak Myun Mok. He was not small, Bak Myun Mok, but he was arrogant and therefore slow and unprepared for my attack. Because we were not allowed to bring cameras and cell phones to our retreat, there are no photographs or videos of the expression of my rage, though the aftermath&#x2014;Bak&#x2019;s broken cheek-bone, his black eyes, his shredded lower lip&#x2014;was duly recorded by the police photographer summoned to the villa. . . . Suffice it to say that the voting procedure was quite irregular, the palmar�s was a satisfactory pandemonium, and the North Korean film won a Special Jury Prize&#x2014;for &#x2018;artistic subversion and visual elegance&#x2019;&#x2014;in consolation.&#x201d;</p> <p>The action spans from Hungary to Toronto to Paris to North Korea and includes incestuous partners: Nathan, a journalist with aspirations to be published in <i>The New Yorker&#x2019;s Annals of Medicine</i> who contracts a once-timely-now-pass� STD (Roiphe&#x2019;s Disease) while doing a profile on a dodgy artist-surgeon, and his lover Naomi, an intrepid techie-gamine in the middle of an Internet investigation of the <i>apparent</i> murder of C�lestine Arosteguy; Dr. Roiphe and his mysterious daughter, who are both engaged in exotically cryptic experimentation on each another in his pristine Toronto dollhouse/hothouse; there&#x2019;s even a nod to Simon Sheen AKA Shin Sang-ok, a (again, true-life) South Korean director who along with his actress wife was kidnapped by Kim Jong-Il in 1978 in order to make movies at the Eternal President&#x2019;s pleasure. Body-perception disorders, communication from the insect kingdom through high-end hearing aids, false identity and complete loss&#x2014;consumption&#x2014;of identities, apotempnophilia (see Cronenberg&#x2019;s <i>Consumed</i>-related short film &#x201c;The Nest,&#x201d; marvelous essay-like musings on jealousy and possession, the blurring of bloodlines and the smearing of blood in the totalitarian politics of family and eros, the fetishization of both disease and cure, the origami of desire fostered by language and mystery, the literal geography of escape that always seem to lead back to the same country (same hyperlink)&#x2014;the Ouroboros of the Web devouring its tail as we consume the information that has become ourselves&#x2014;are just some of the threads that weave through Cronenberg&#x2019;s impossibly possible tapestry of <i>au courant</i> fears and reactions to the all-consuming Now.</p> <p> I&#x2019;ve heard of a syndrome that affects the caregivers of partners with Alzheimer&#x2019;s; in time, they begin a slow, barely perceptible descent into an alternate reality forged by the agonies of empathic adaptation.

In this recent effort, he brings to life the immortal Japanese illustrator and printmaker Hokusai. And just as he made real the "land of the giants," so he brings the reader into the swirling and vibrant world of Tokyo. Trained early as an engraver, Hokusai studied under the master Sunsho, producing illustrated volumes of verse. His first manga volume followed in 1814, after he abandoned the traditional style of engraving to perfect the technique of the colored woodcut, in what many consider his greatest work, The 36 Views of Mt Fuji. His life was unsettled, his marriages uncertain, and his business affairs irregular, but his energy was boundless. He left for posterity thousands of sketches and drawings, illustrated books and prints, saying just before he died in 1889 "If heaven gives me ten more years (or even an extension of five), I shall certainly become a true artist." <br><p><br>The exuberance of his life is marvelously conveyed in Place's tribute to an artist who clearly ranks among his heroes. Both have the same genius for draughtsmanship, the perfectly defined, energetic stroke, the subtle wash. We see the humor and pathos of Hokusai's life, recorded through the eyes of a young apprentice. This is a lovely book by an artist and writer we consider among the very best of his generation.</p></p><p>Grade 3-6-Tojiro, a nine-year-old orphan, sells rice cakes on the streets of 19th-century Edo, the bustling city we now call Tokyo. One of his customers is the grumpy, eccentric octogenarian Hokusai. The old man takes a liking to Tojiro, and soon employs him as his assistant. The boy's ignorance provides a convenient vehicle for introducing the artist's life and work. Much of the dialogue and action is too obviously written for the purpose of conveying information about Hokusai, as well as the technique of woodblock printing and the social customs of Edo. The book's greatest strength is not the text, but the art that enlivens every page. A combination of the author's watercolors and reproductions of Hokusai's drawings and woodblock prints, the illustrations are arranged in enticing and varied page designs. Place's detailed paintings, clearly influenced by Hokusai, but with a life that is all their own, depict the action of the story. The reproductions allow readers to discover the artist's masterpieces along with Tojiro, and wonder how much his sketchbooks, called manga, have influenced modern Japanese cartoons. Schools where Japan is studied will want this very handsome small volume, as will public libraries where there is an interest in Japanese art.<br><i>Margaret A. Chang, Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts, North Adams</i><br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.*Starred Review* Gr. 5-8. In nineteenth century Edo, nine-year-old Tojiro delivers rice cakes on a route that includes a strange old man who draws. Gradually Tojiro befriends the artist Hokusai and becomes his assistant. Under his tutelage, Tojiro discovers the process of woodblock engraving, studies Hokusai's earlier art, and prompts the old man's memories. Although the rapport of the master and apprentice is a vehicle to introduce Hokusai's art and times, the tender relationship is credibly drawn with humor and insight. Exquisitely detailed ink and watercolor illustrations embellish every page. Sometimes the elegant sketches edge the page; sometimes they fill and spill over pages. Some portray busy city scenes and handsome landscapes; others feature a single expressive figure or image. Good reproductions of Hokusai's drawings appear as they are introduced in the narrative. An illustrated glossary is attached, but most unfamiliar terms are easily understood in context. An excellent curriculum supplement, this will enchant and inspire aspiring artists and transport even casual browsers to nineteenth-century Japan. <i>Linda Perkins</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Elizabeth Longford, intimate of the royal family and biographer of Victoria and Elizabeth II, has assembled the best anecdotes ever written and reported abut the kings and queens of England, across the full range of Britain's history from the first century A.D. to the present day.<br> Scholars and versifiers, lawgivers and saints crowd the pages alongside soldiers, scallywags, and imbeciles, and never have these distant figures been brought more vividly to life than in this splendid anthology. We read of Alfred's burnt cakes, Cnut and the wolves, Henry VIII and his six wives, George III resigning himself to American independence, Edward VII's gambling habits, and much more. There are samplings of royal wit (as when James I said of John Donne's poetry: Dr Donne's verses are like the peace of God; they pass all understanding."), of royal modesty (as in Elizabeth II's explanation of why she wore no crown at the musician Robert Mayer's 100th birthday party: "I thought it was Sir Robert's night, not mine."), and of royal certitude (as in Victoria's comment during a dark moment of the Boer War: "Please understand that there is no one depressed this house; we are not interested in the possibilities of defeat; they do not exist.")<br> The Countess of Longford's helpful commentary clarifies the complexities of royal genealogy and adds a sharp and often humorous perspective to bygone events. Her sources range from the earliest medieval chroniclers to biographers and historians of today, from dispassionate descriptions to intimate and revealing accounts from the letters and journals of the monarchs themselves. The result is truly a historical feast fit for a king.</p><p><br><em>About the Author:</em><br><strong>The Countess of Longford</strong>'s other books include <em>Victoria RI</em>, <em>The Queen Mother: A Biography</em>, and <em>Elizabeth R</em>.<br>A royal biographer par excellence , as is evidenced by Victoria RI , Elizabeth R , and The Queen Mother , Longford is ideally suited to edit this work. It is absolutely jam-packed with tempting tidbits, ranging from Henry VIII's witticisms to all sorts of entertaining comments about royalty by their contemporaries. A sentence or two by the editor sets the stage in each case, thereby giving the reader a sense of context, as well as making the anecdotal material that much more palatable. Teachers needing to add spice to their lectures, speakers to their presentations, writers to their books, will find this work invaluable.

Visit him online at www.danpoblocki.com.Gr 5-8-When Neil's father abandons the family to pursue fame in California, Neil and his teenage sister, Bree, are sent to stay with their aunts while their mother receives treatment for depression. The small upstate New York village where Claire and Anna live is home to Graylock Hall, a state psychiatric hospital that closed down 15 years earlier after several teenaged patients drowned. Neil's new friend Wesley quickly fills him in on the local legend of Nurse Janet, who is thought to be responsible for the patients' deaths and now haunts the abandoned building. Since Neil's favorite TV show is Ghostly Investigators, he relishes the thought of exploring the hospital for clues. But when he and Wesley, along with their older siblings, break into the building, they set off a chain of harrowing events that cannot be explained. In the days after their narrow escape, Neil and Bree are plagued by horrific visions and nightly visits from a ghost. As time goes on, they slowly realize that their spectral visitor is one of the drowning victims who wants to bring her murderer to justice. The further the four get in uncovering clues, the more apparent it becomes that Nurse Janet has been unjustly accused-and that the real murderer is intent on making sure that the truth is never brought to light. As with The Nightmarys (Random, 2010), Poblocki is in his element with eerie happenings and atmospheric settings. Short chapters with cliff-hanger endings and several twists and turns in the plot will ensure that the pages turn quickly.

Size C. 432 pp. 20,000 print.</p><p>The Byzantine Empire, one of its most eminent students reminds us, lasted &#34;for a total of 1,123 years and 18 days,&#34; which is an astonishing duration matched by only a few others. Condensing Norwich&#39;s three-volume history, this overview captures the splendor and strangeness of Byzantine rule, marked by family intrigues, constant warfare, political and religious strife, and personal ambition--a &#34;somewhat lurid background,&#34; as Norwich modestly declares in passing. Norwich is a master of the telling vignette. In one, he writes of imperial guards made up of &#34;Anglo-Saxons who had left their country in disgust after Hastings and had taken service with Byzantium.&#34; Facing a Norman enemy in southern Italy, these Anglo-Saxons exacted terrible vengeance until the Normans rallied under the leadership of a fearless woman, one Sichelgaita, and massacred their enemy. Norwich&#39;s book abounds in similarly surprising and absorbing episodes.John Julius Norwich is an active member of the House of Lords.</p><h2>Empire of Shadows: The Epic Story of Yellowstone</h2><p>George Black rediscovers the history and lore of one of the planet s most magnificent landscapes.

He lives in New York.</p>1 <br>&#x201c;A KNOWLEDGE OF THESE PEOPLE&#x201d; <br> <i>1805&#x2013;1806</i> <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>They had soldiered together, and they were nominally co-captains of the Corps of Discovery, but Meriwether Lewis and William Clark could hardly have been more contrasting personalities. The redheaded Clark was the elder by four years. He was an experienced frontiersman and Indian fighter, with a talent for mapmaking and navigation, a natural command of men, and an open, genial character. Lewis was a child of privilege, scion of one of the first families of Virginia, and personal secretary to the president, whom he regarded as a virtual father figure. But there was an awkward formality about Lewis, and he had a &#x201c;martial temper.&#x201d; Above all he was a manic depressive, veering wildly from limitless excitement to dark feelings of impotence and failure that would eventually lead him to suicide. The episodes of euphoria sometimes made him reckless, and on the homeward leg of the journey, in the summer of 1806, he made a critical misjudgment, ignoring the warnings of people to whom he should have paid close attention. <br>In the matter of their contact with Indians, Jefferson&#x2019;s instructions to Lewis and Clark1 had been detailed and explicit. The president wrote, &#x201c;The commerce which may be carried on with the people inhabiting the line you will pursue, renders a knoledge of these people important.&#x201d; What that meant in practice was that Lewis and Clark were to acquaint themselves with the names and numbers of the tribes they encountered; their languages, occupations, and peculiarities of law and custom; their characteristic diseases and remedies; how they dressed and what they ate; the extent of each tribe&#x2019;s territory; and the state of intertribal relations. Jefferson continued, &#x201c;Considering the interest which every nation has in extending &amp; strengthening the authority of reason &amp; justice among the people around them, it will be useful to acquire what knowledge you can of the state of morality, religion &amp; information among them, as it may better enable those who endeavor to civilize &amp; instruct them.&#x201d; <br>The president was clear that violence was to be avoided wherever possible: &#x201c;In all your intercourse with the natives treat them in the most friendly &amp; conciliatory manner which their own conduct will admit.&#x201d; If the explorers ran into an overwhelming display of hostile force, they should retreat. This was a matter of simple pragmatism. Engagement would risk, at the very least, loss of the data collected by the expedition, while turning back to give a full reporting of the number and disposition of hostiles would allow future explorers to return with the proper amount of hardware. <br>This is not to say that Lewis and Clark went ill-equipped. On the contrary, they carried the largest arsenal that had ever been seen west of the Missouri. The threat of violence was implicit in the act of exploration, and certainly in Jefferson&#x2019;s intent to civilize. The Corps of Discovery was a military expedition, under military discipline. The explorers were uninvited guests in an unknown land, and any tribe they encountered was assumed to be hostile until proven otherwise. To a belligerent tribe seeking dominance over its neighbors, what greater temptation than the rifles, powder horns, bullet molds, gunsmith&#x2019;s tools, knives, and tomahawks that Lewis had commissioned from the United States arsenal at Harpers Ferry? The basic truth about weaponry is that it is an enticement to violence as well as a safeguard against it. Or put another way, Lewis and Clark, and many subsequent explorations of the West, proved Chekhov&#x2019;s first iron law of theater: Hang a pistol on the wall in the first act, and it is sure to be fired before the final curtain. <br>Miraculously, however, it took more than two years for the point to be proved. In the meantime, there were incidents and near-incidents. As the expedition labored upstream on the Missouri in September 1804, a group of Teton Sioux chiefs, after downing a glass or two, or three, of whiskey on the explorers&#x2019; keelboat, expressed their dissatisfaction with Lewis&#x2019;s gifts of peace medals, coats, and hats, and refused to be put ashore without more, while warriors milled around on the bank with their bows strung. Lewis ordered the boat&#x2019;s swivel gun loaded with musket balls and held a lighted taper over the fuse until they dispersed. Three days later, there was a second, similar episode, this time because a gift of tobacco was considered insultingly meager. But on both occasions the offended chiefs backed down, the warriors put away their arrows, and the fuse of the swivel gun remained unlit.2 <br>Lewis&#x2019;s temper almost got the better of him nineteen months later, as the party headed back up the Columbia from the Pacific and spent several days in the country of the Chinooks. The captain had mixed feelings about these people. On one hand he was disdainful of their general demeanor (&#x201c;low and ill-shaped&nbsp;&#x2026; badly clad and illy made&#x201d;). On the other, he had to acknowledge that they were peaceable sorts (&#x201c;the greatest harmoney appears to exist among them&#x201d;). But the Chinooks were inveterate petty thieves, and that drove Lewis to distraction. They stole an ax; they stole a lump of lead; they tried to steal a tomahawk from Private John Colter, who was not a man to trifle with; they stole Lewis&#x2019;s black dog, Seaman, which almost pushed him over the edge. It was not clear whether the thieves intended to eat the dog, as many tribes did. <br>One of the Chinook chiefs apologized. He tried to explain the problem of tribal authority; there were limits to the discipline a chief could impose, and there was not much he could do if a few hotheaded young men yielded to temptation. Lewis had to understand that the village as a whole wanted peace. But Lewis didn&#x2019;t really understand, and few whites would. Friendly and/or powerless chiefs, and young warriors who saw theft and violence as a display of valor and a source of prestige: This would be a running theme for the rest of the century and the root of one violent confrontation after another. <br>As if to underline the chief&#x2019;s point, the thieving continued. Tomahawks and knives went missing in the night. Lewis threatened beatings. A saddle disappeared, and a buffalo robe. Then he caught a man red-handed, as he tried to liberate an iron socket from a discarded canoe pole. He flew into a rage and told the village that &#x201c;I would shoot the first of them that attempted to steal an article from us.&#x201d; He went beyond this to the threat of collective punishment, informing the Chinooks &#x201c;that I had it in my power at that moment to kill them all and set fire to their houses.&#x201d; But then he summoned all his self-control, no doubt contemplating the political consequences of acting out his threat, and the Corps of Discovery moved on toward the territory of a tribe about whom Lewis felt differently.3 <br>Lewis and his companions got on well with many of the tribes, to be fair. As Clark noted in his journal, &#x201c;A cuirous custom&nbsp;&#x2026; is to give handsome squars to those whom they wish to show more acknowledgments to.&#x201d; The men of the corps, he reported in March 1805, were &#x201c;generally healthy except Venerials Complaints which is verry Common amongst the natives and the men Catch it from them.&#x201d;4 <br>The explorers had a mutual love affair with the Mandans, whose amiable welcome made their villages a favored stopover for generations of European and American adventurers on the upper Missouri. Lewis liked the Arikara, too, and the Clatsops. He found the Wallawallas &#x201c;the most hospitable, honest, and sincere people that we have met with in our voyage.&#x201d;5 The Flatheads were friendly. The Shoshone were &#x201c;frank, communicative, fair in dealing, generous with the little they possess, extreemly honest, and by no means beggarly.&#x201d;6 And of course there was Sacagawea, herself a Shoshone, freed from slavery among the Hidatsa. <br>But no tribe stood in quite such high regard as the Nez Perce. There is disagreement about how the tribe acquired its odd name. Some of them appear to have indeed pierced their noses and ornamented them with dentalium shells, which they acquired in trade with the tribes of the Pacific Coast. Other authorities say the name is a mistranslation of sign language. The Plains tribes indicated the Nez Perce by passing the index finger over the nose with a slashing motion; this was a sign of bravery, denoting people who did not flinch even if an arrow came that close. <br>Lewis and Clark also attested to this bravery, but they spoke too of the gentleness of the Nez Perce men, as well as the intelligence and attractiveness of the women. The explorers found the Nez Perce to be proud, dignified, reserved, slow to anger, attentive to personal cleanliness. Their language contained no profanity. They were orators, who settled their disputes by a prolonged search for consensus. The tribe was famous for its horse breeding and its horsemanship. <br>There were perhaps four thousand Nez Perce when the Corps of Discovery encountered them, divided into a number of small, autonomous bands. The men hunted and fished for salmon and cutthroat trout; the women gathered berries and dug camas roots, which they pounded into flour for bread that gave Lewis chronic gas and diarrhea. Buffalo were gone from the plateau country west of the Rockies by the time the expedition arrived, so the Nez Perce crossed the mountains each summer to hunt the great herds on the plains of what is now Montana. It is this knowledge of the high passes that explains the tribe&#x2019;s warm relationship with Lewis and Clark. The Nez Perce knew the way across the Continental Divide, and they knew the dangers that lurked on the other side. Captain Lewis took their advice on the first count, and ignored it on the second. <br>The most daunting moment of the outward journey occurred in September 1805 when the captains contemplated the sheer granite wall of the Bitterroots. &#x201c;The most terrible mountains I ever beheld,&#x201d; remarked Sergeant Patrick Gass.7 The Columbia River and the Pacific Ocean lay somewhere on the far side. They bought some fresh horses from a friendly band of Flatheads. With the help of the expedition&#x2019;s translator, George Drouillard (Drewyer, for the most part, in Lewis&#x2019;s journals, or sometimes Drulyard), son of a French-Canadian father and a Shawnee mother, Lewis constructed a summary Flathead vocabulary. The tribe spoke in a guttural fashion that led Lewis to think they might be the descendants of Prince Madoc and a wandering band of Welshmen. Jefferson subscribed to the theory that such a tribe was out there, somewhere in the Western wilds. <br>The Corps of Discovery had better horses now, but the &#x201c;emince Dificuelt Knobs&#x201d; remained to be conquered. On Lolo Creek, at a campground they called Travelers&#x2019; Rest, a group of hunters went out to supplement the party&#x2019;s dwindling rations as it prepared for the crossing. John Colter, the soldier who would later withhold his tomahawk from the larcenous Chinooks, brought back three Indians who said they lived on the other side of the mountains. They were Nez Perce, and they indicated a trail across the divide that would take the explorers to their villages in six days. It took eleven in reality, and they were the worst days of the whole trip, beset by snowdrifts, hailstorms, dysentery, fallen timber, the eating of a colt when the rest of the food ran out, and the loss of Clark&#x2019;s writing desk when a packhorse fell forty feet down a precipice. <br>The elderly chief of the Nez Perce villages was Twisted Hair, a &#x201c;Chearfull man with apparent Siencerity.&#x201d; He offered hospitality, traded food for trinkets, knives, and tobacco, and allowed the men to lie up for more than a week while Clark treated their intestinal troubles with salt pills and other emetics. Clark wrote that his modest doctoring abilities &#x201c;raised my reputation and gives those nativs an exolted oppinion of my skill as a phisician.&#x201d; Most important, the Nez Perce made no move to relieve the ailing and vulnerable explorers of their weapons, despite having no more than a couple of defective rifles with which to defend themselves against hostile tribes. <br>In early May 1806, Lewis and Clark were back from the western sea, and as they prepared to recross the Bitterroots the friendship between the whites and the Nez Perce was cemented. It would endure for more than half a century until it was finally betrayed by settlers, soldiers, and the lust for gold. <br>While the Nez Perce had declined the opportunity to steal the explorers&#x2019; guns, they had no objection to being armed as part of a larger geopolitical compact. Lewis laid this out in the stump speech he gave to all the tribes, sweetened by the medals and the flags and the trade trinkets. The Nez Perce would accept an American-dominated system of trading posts and agree to live in peace with their neighbors; in exchange they would be given a guarantee of security, with guns and ammunition to protect themselves. The Nez Perce pointed out only one flaw with this scheme, but it was a serious one. The Blackfeet would never stand for it. <br>Violent resistance was built into that tribe&#x2019;s creation myth, and they were well supplied with weapons from traders in the British possessions to the north. When Napi, Old Man, was done with fashioning the prairies, the mountains, and the forests, he marked the ground and told the Blackfeet, &#x201c;This is your land. It is full of animals and other things which I have given you. Let no other people come into it. When others cross the line, take your bows and arrows, your lances and your battle axes, and keep them out. If they remain, trouble will come.&#x201d;8 <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>The Corps of Discovery&#x2019;s second crossing of the mountains was no easier than the first. By early June the captains were eager to be on the move, but the Nez Perce pointed up at the peaks, observing that the winter snowfall had been prodigious, and counseled a few more weeks of patience. Clark was inclined to heed their advice. &#x201c;I Shudder with the expectation with great dificuelties in passing these Mountains,&#x201d; he wrote.9 Lewis was having none of it; he pronounced this a &#x201c;delightfull season for travelling&#x201d; and decided they should proceed without a guide. He was wrong on both counts. The snow turned out to be fifteen feet deep, and there was no grass for the horses. For the first time in two years the explorers were forced to retrace their steps. Lewis sent Drouillard back to the Nez Perce villages for help and the captains cooled their heels in camp for a week. Clark seems to have found a silver lining in the &#x201c;great dificuelties&#x201d; of the crossing, since a child with reddish hair, who later became a familiar figure to Montana settlers, was born about nine months later, the outcome of Clark&#x2019;s dalliance with a Nez Perce woman. <br>Eventually Drouillard returned with three young men who agreed to see them safely across. The plan was for the expedition to split into two groups when it got back to Travelers&#x2019; Rest, the first time it had ever risked such a step, and to reassemble about six weeks later at the confluence of the Yellowstone and the Missouri. Clark would take one group and head down the Yellowstone. Lewis, with the rest of the party, would follow the Nez Perce trail along the Blackfoot River and into the buffalo country. Once they reached the Great Falls of the Missouri, the Lewis party would subdivide again. One group would stay on the big river to dig up a large cache of supplies the explorers had left there the previous year and prepare for Clark&#x2019;s portage around the falls. Lewis, with half a dozen volunteers, would explore &#x201c;at every hazard&#x201d; the Marias River, which entered the Missouri from the northwest. Lewis named it for his cousin, Maria Wood. Originally, then, it was Maria&#x2019;s River, but the apostrophe fell away w...</p><h2>Daccord 2019 Level 1 Teacher&#39;s Edition</h2><p>Brand new.

Original.</p><p>Many horror stories are about loners or misfits, but <i>The Ignored</i> is about a man who is so average, who fits into society so well, he disappears from view. In a harrowing progression reminiscent of an episode from <i>Twilight Zone,</i> Bob Jones drifts into a state where his co-workers can't see him, his friends don't recognize him, his parents die and he's not even invited to the funeral. Then he joins up with others of "the Ignored," a tiny minority in their own pocket of reality who validate each other in their mediocrity. The strength of this tale is in Bentley Little's willingness to explore all the possible fates open to Bob Jones, as if trying out alternative endings for the novel. This is horror of ideas--a chilling commentary on the blandness of a society that has a McDonald's on every corner and entertainment that is safe, boring, and middle-of-the-road.</p><h2>NIV Life Application Study Bible</h2><p>- Application Notes provide penetrating insight into what the Bible says to you about how you live. - Book Introductions use timelines, overviews, and outlines to prepare you to hear and respond to the book&#39;s truths. - Character Sketches spotlight key Bible figures and the lessons you can learn from their lives. - In-Text Charts and Maps help you locate key places and grasp difficult concepts at a glance. - Dictionary-Concordance developed specifically for the NIV Life Application Study Bible. - Red Letter Edition with the words of Christ printed in red.</p><p>The addition of two new features make the popular NIV Life Application Study Bible even better!

While most Americans are building large homes to impress the neighbors, you could be building an energy efficient, low-profile house with backup solar power, generators, fuel storage, high-security doors, wood heat and unique security spaces. Joel Skousen is a pioneer in this field of self-sufficient, high-security retreats and has over 45 years experience designing houses with innovative aspects of energy efficiency and protection, together with his son Andrew, a structural engineer. The Secure Home is a comprehensive "How To" manual that covers every aspect of securing your home, including high security construction techniques for walls, windows and doors. It will take you through the planning stages of designing a secure home from the ground up, and includes an extensive section on how to remodel an existing home for security. The book covers all the types of mechanical systems, including alternative equipment for heating, cooling, and power generation, using multiple sources&#x2014;wood, water, wind, solar, and various types of combustible fuel. This new 4th edition is a complete textual update and contains all the latest technology on solar systems and lithium-ion batteries, which now more than ever, lends itself to self-consumption of solar power within the home rather than selling it all back to the grid at a steep discount and buying it back at retail prices. Whether you are looking to build your own home or remodel an existing one with preparations for realistic threats including earthquakes, crime, war and fallout, the 4th Edition of the Secure Home can show you how and help you implement it all.</p><p>Joel Skousen&#39;s books are highly sought after due to the great amount of hands-on experience he has in this field. His original Survival Home Manual was the pioneering work in the high security residential field, over 25 years ago. This completely new work, with an updated title (The Secure Home) is destined to replace his original work as THE definitive work in the field of self-sufficient and high security architecture.This book contains all of the design concepts and implementation details I use in my work. I have placed these valuable illustrations and descriptions in The Secure Home to help readers do all or part of their own design work. My work load has increased so much over the years that I only have time to consult on design now and must leave the detail design work to other designers or architects. This book provides the necessary details to help others do the implementation. This allows me to better serve hundreds of clients each year instead of a handful. I encourage a lot of do-it-yourself design and construction and thus have tried to develop many simply and inexpensive ways to provide security. With the online update of recommended equipment and products it saves me from having to revise the entire print edition to keep the book current.</p><h2>From Leading to Liberty: One Hundred Training Games Your Horse Will Want to Play</h2><p>In this book, Jutta Wiemers describes 100 "smart" games through which you can achieve a perfect partnership with your horse.

In the maple tree, a raccoon family is seen making a home alongside an owl; the barnyard farm geese wait for wild geese to pass; in the stable and the barn, horses and cows stand and stare; in the back, sheep huddle close to stay warm. Deer gather near the orchard pond; and on the old stone wall, field mice hide their seeds and berries. This is a rare depiction of the "heart of the darkness," not only as a safe, snug place, but as a celebration of life, hope and wonder. Jeffers's night world is carved out from the majesty of nature and the awe of creation. The subdued colors of darkness have never been happier; a fine-line pen shapes every square inch of the farm and overshadows all creatures, large and small.

Everybody has that black hole at the beginning of their life. That time you can&#x2019;t remember. Your first step. Your first taste of table food. My real memories begin in our assigned living area in Compound 14.&#x201d; <br><br>Just a generation ago, this place was called America. Now, after the worldwide implementation of a UN-led program called Agenda 21, it&#x2019;s simply known as &#x201c;the Republic.&#x201d; There is no president. No Congress. No Supreme Court. No freedom. <br><br>There are only the Authorities. <br><br>Citizens have two primary goals in the new Republic: to create clean energy and to create new human life. Those who cannot do either are of no use to society. This bleak and barren existence is all that eighteen-year-old Emmeline has ever known. She dutifully walks her energy board daily and accepts all male pairings assigned to her by the Authorities. Like most citizens, she keeps her head down and her eyes closed. <br><br>Until the day they come for her mother. <br><br>&#x201c;You save what you think you&#x2019;re going to lose.&#x201d; <br><br>Woken up to the harsh reality of her life and her family&#x2019;s future inside the Republic, Emmeline begins to search for the truth. Why are all citizens confined to ubiquitous concrete living spaces? Why are Compounds guarded by Gatekeepers who track all movements? Why are food, water and energy rationed so strictly? And, most important, why are babies taken from their mothers at birth? As Emmeline begins to understand the true objectives of Agenda 21 she realizes that she is up against far more than she ever thought. With the Authorities closing in, and nowhere to run, Emmeline embarks on an audacious plan to save her family and expose the Republic&#x2014;but is she already too late?&nbsp;</p><p>Glenn Beck, the nationally syndicated radio host and founder of TheBlaze television network, has written thirteen #1 bestselling books and is one of the few authors in history to have had #1 national bestsellers in the fiction, nonfiction, self-help, and children&#x2019;s picture book genres.

They just came in, men in black uniforms. Enforcers. I shut off my board and stumbled, hitting my hip against the metal sidebar. They didn&#x2019;t say anything but held up their hands in a way that told me to stop and not come any closer. My meter was only halfway to the finish point. Mother had gotten off her sleeping mat when she heard them at the door and stood there, head down. How tangled her hair looked, gray and lifeless.<br> <br>They asked which sleeping mat was hers. She pointed to mine. I started to say, &#x201c;No that&#x2019;s mine,&#x201d; but she gave a little shake of her head so I kept quiet. One of them rolled up the mat and put it under his arm. The other one tied short, dirty ropes to Mother&#x2019;s wrists. I knew not to cry in front of the Enforcers but tears burned hot behind my eyes.<br> <br>Mother hadn&#x2019;t done her duty walking since I was paired with Jeremy two days ago. She had stayed curled up on her sleeping mat, her face to the wall, her back a row of bony knobs. I had walked both my board and hers those two days so our meters would register at Central Authority for two people. That was the only way to get food for both of us.<br> <br>Maybe they could tell one person was doing two different meters because the meters registered at different times. Who knows? I&#x2019;ve seen too many things over the almost eighteen years I&#x2019;ve spent on this Earth to ever doubt the Authority&#x2019;s power.<br> <br>Mother went quietly, shuffling her feet across the rough concrete floor. She looked back at me and said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry I didn&#x2019;t teach you enough&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I love you.&#x201d; There was a scratchy sound to her voice as though the words were stuck inside her. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Emmeline.&#x201d; I didn&#x2019;t know what she meant and I didn&#x2019;t have time to ask. The Enforcers, one on each side of her, tugged on the ropes. She looked weak and shrunken between them.<br> <br>I watched through the window slit as they pulled Mother up the steps of the bus-box. How trapped she looked sitting between them. Six other men, large and muscular in orange uniforms, stood in their harnesses. The Transport Team. The bus-box lurched forward as the men began walking in unison. I watched until it disappeared around the curve past our Compound.<br> <br>Then I ran after her. The Gatekeeper didn&#x2019;t see me; he was making rounds at the far end. I ran as fast and as hard as I could along the ridge between the ruts in the dirt road, the muscles in my legs clenching and unclenching like fists, until I could see the bus-box.<br> <br>I slipped to the side of the road, crouching down, creeping closer. The bus-box turned onto a narrower road, hidden by trees. I never knew that road was there.<br> <br>The green flag marking the area was barely visible. Beyond it was a building I had never seen before. Bigger than any Living Space and a deeper, darker gray than the other buildings. No window slits, just blank, forbidding walls.<br> <br>The bus-box stopped in front of the building&#x2019;s only door. Through the trees I could see the Enforcers walk Mother to the door. Dust swirled around her ankles as she shuffled. The odor here seemed familiar but was much more potent.<br> <br>Mother still had the ropes on her wrists and the Enforcers were holding them tightly. She turned, looked at me as though she knew I&#x2019;d been following her the whole time, and somehow was able to raise one hand to touch her chest, her heart. That motion lasted only a second. I&#x2019;ll remember it for a lifetime.<br> <br>A hand reached out and pulled Mother inside. The door slammed shut.<br> <br>While the Enforcers got back on the bus-box, I hid behind a tree and watched until they disappeared. Then I leaned my head against the tree and beat my fists against the rough bark until they bled.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>Alone.<br> <br>I had never been alone before. Mother never allowed that. Never. Jeremy was not yet back from work. Around me was only gray. Gray walls, gray floor. A cold concrete square. One window slit on each of the four walls and the single wooden door that led outside to the Compound&#x2019;s common area, a packed dirt space with a gate, guarded by a Gatekeeper. Inside, the space was divided into three areas. To one side of the door was the eating space with a counter to place our nourishment cubes and water bottles on. On the other side, the washing-up room with its limp privacy curtain. In the back was the sleeping area, with our mats on the floor and hooks on the wall to hang our uniforms. Along the wall on the right was the energy output area. This is where our boards stood, side by side.<br> <br>These were all the spaces where Mother used to be.<br> <br>I walked into the sleeping area. Mother&#x2019;s mat, just long enough and wide enough for one person, covered with the same frayed fabric as the privacy curtain, was stretched over a foam mattress four inches thick on the cold concrete floor. Her blanket had fallen onto the floor. I picked it up and held it to my face, breathing deeply. The fabric was rough and cold, but it smelled of Mother, her skin, her hair. I could see the imprint of her body on the mat. Where her head had been, her shoulders, her hips. I ran my fingertips over the mat, feeling those spaces. Then I curled up in the imprint and pulled her blanket over me. It was safe to cry now.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>There was nothing to do but get back on my board and walk. Create energy. Create energy. Create energy. Get my meter to finish. The sound of my feet pounding on the board and another sound, a low hiss, as the friction and heat of the board is siphoned away through a small hose connected to an outlet in the wall and then into the energy download bar in front of our space. Every Space has a download bar like ours, but the bars belong to the Central Authority. They own everything. They use the energy to supply our needs. Our nourishment cubes, our clothing, everything. They call it the Energy Neutral Policy. I hate their big titles.<br> <br>Mother once told me that producing energy was one of the two things the Republic cared about most. The other thing was producing healthy babies. Being productive and being reproductive. The most valuable Citizens were both. Mother said I was one of the most valuable. I didn&#x2019;t know what she meant at the time.<br> <br>The half-hour-till-dusk bell tolled. Jeremy would be home after dusk. We&#x2019;d eat our nourishment cubes together, drink our water rations. I didn&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;d be hungry, but I was already thirsty. I noticed that the needle of my energy meter had moved past halfway.<br> <br>When they had paired me with Jeremy, Mother refused to get off her sleeping mat to meet him. Men with mustaches from Central Authority got off the bus-box first and walked in lockstep to our door, legs moving straight and stiff as though they had no knees. They had a new headscarf for me, white trimmed in black, and they turned their backs as I removed my black headscarf, my widow scarf, and put this one on. Then Jeremy, escorted by an Enforcer, got off the bus-box. He was thin, scrawny, and his skin was pale.<br> <br>They did the pairing ceremony, the exchange of vows, in front of our Living Space: I will honor the Republic. I will produce energy for the Republic. I will produce Citizens for the Republic. Praise be to the Republic. Then we all made the circle sign, with our thumb and forefinger held against our foreheads, to salute the Republic.<br> <br>The men went back to the bus-box and left. Jeremy and I were officially paired. We went into our Living Space. He looked around as though he had never seen one before. He pulled the privacy curtain aside and glanced into the washing-up area. He looked out of the window slits, going from one to the other, pacing back and forth with nervous little steps. Finally he stopped pacing and leaned against the counter.<br> <br>&#x201c;I wanted a virgin. And what did I get?&#x201d; He glanced at me. &#x201c;You. And an old lady.&#x201d; He glanced at Mother.<br> <br>She sat up slowly and pointed her finger at him. I noticed for the first time how old her hands looked, how her finger curved like a claw. She looked sad and started to say something but didn&#x2019;t.<br> <br>Jeremy said nothing else, but his eyes narrowed and his lips pinched together. Mother lay back down and never did speak to him.<br> <br>That was two days ago.<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t teach you enough. What did she mean? What didn&#x2019;t I know?<br> <br>Sometimes she talked a lot. Her voice had been like a metronome. Tick, talk, tick, talk. It filled our space. She scratched at her skin as she talked. Fingernails digging into her arms, her ankles. Making little sore spots bigger, crusted with blood.<br> <br>&#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t always like this,&#x201d; she would say.<br> <br>&#x201c;Tell me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We had our own farm once. Land. Rolling hills. Green fields. We raised animals, crops. We owned property. It was ours.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What happened to it? Where was it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Far away. It was far away. Laws changed. The Authority owns all the property now.&#x201d;<br> <br>Why, I wanted to ask, did the laws change? But I didn&#x2019;t ask her, didn&#x2019;t interrupt the stories. If I did, she would shut down and turn her face to the wall. That would be the end of her talking.<br> <br>&#x201c;We kept animals on the farm,&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>Imagine that! Keeping animals! At every Social Update Meeting they remind us that animals are sacred and belong to the Earth, not to people. Animals are protected. We have to recite, in unison, the Pledge of Animals.<br> <br>I pledge allegiance to the Earth and to the sacred rights of the Earth and to the Animals of the Earth.<br> <br>Just last month a man was dragged by the Enforcers to the front of the Social Update Meeting and made to kneel before the Authorities. They accused him of running over a snake with his energy bicycle. I think he tried to say it was an accident, but his voice was shaking and hard to hear. His head was down, his chin almost on his chest. He looked small and old, kneeling that way. They put the ropes on his wrists and led him away.<br> <br>Everyone at the meeting kept their eyes on their shoes. They looked tired and pale and wilted. I think every single person watching knew that could just as well have been them on any given day, for any given reason.<br> <br>Mother said taking him away was wrong, just wrong. But she didn&#x2019;t say it very loudly.</p><h2>Tales from Earthsea : Short Stories</h2><p>These five superlative, evocative and enchanting stories range from a few hundred years before A Wizard of Earthsea to just before The Other Wind, and feature some of Le Guin&#x2019;s most p[opular characters, including the Wizard Ged himself. The stories are rounded off with an essay about Earthsea&#x2019;s history and people.No Earthsea fan will want to be without this magical collection.</p><p>Winner of five Nebula and five Hugo Awards, the National Book Award, the Newbery, and many other awards, Ursula K. Le Guin is one of the finest authors ever to write science fiction and fantasy. Her greatest creation may be the powerful, beautifully written, and deeply imagined Earthsea Cycle, which inhabits the rarified air at the pinnacle of modern fantasy with J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy and Jane Yolen's Chronicles of Great Alta. The books of the Earthsea Cycle are <i>A Wizard of Earthsea</i> (1968), <i>The Tombs of Atuan</i> (1971), <i>The Farthest Shore</i> (1972), the Nebula-winning <i>Tehanu</i> (1990), and now, <i>Tales of Earthsea</i> (2001). <p> If you have never read an Earthsea book, this collection isn't the place to start, as the author points out in her thoughtful foreword; begin with <i>A Wizard of Earthsea</i>. If you insist on starting with <i>Tales of Earthsea</i>, read the foreword and the appended "Description of Earthsea" before proceeding to the five stories (three of which are original to this book).</p> <p> The opening story, "The Finder," occupies a third of the volume and has the strength and insight of a novel. This novella describes the youth of Otter, a powerful but half-trained sorcerer, and reveals how Otter came to an isle that cannot be found, and played a role in the founding of the great Roke School. "Darkrose and Diamond" tells of two lovers who would turn their backs on magic. In "The Bones of the Earth," an aging wizard and his distant pupil must somehow join forces to oppose an earthquake. Ged, the Archmage of Earthsea, appears in "On the High Marsh" to find the mad and dangerous mage he had driven from Roke Island. And in "Dragonfly," the closing story, a mysterious woman comes to the Roke School to challenge the rule that only men may be mages. "Dragonfly" takes place a few years after <i>Tehanu</i> and is the bridge between that novel and the next novel, <i>The Other Wind</i> (fall 2001). <i>--Cynthia Ward</i></p>Ursula K. Le Guin has won many Nebula and Hugo Awards, as well as a National Book Award, a Pushcart Prize, the Harold D. Vursell Memorial Award of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, a Newbery Honor and the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement.</p><h2>Word Biblical Commentary Vol. 29, Ezekiel 20-48 (allen), 333pp</h2><p><p>The Word Biblical Commentary delivers the best in biblical scholarship, from the leading scholars of our day who share a commitment to Scripture as divine revelation.

A blend of Eastern wisdom, feng shui, and the movement toward simplicity, Wabi Sabi is a Japanese expression meaning "wisdom in natural simplicity." Wabi Sabi helps us to see the beauty in imperfection, to discover that our unique flaws also can lead us to our greatest strengths and treasures.<br><br>No one is perfect--in fact, we all are perfectly imperfect. That is the paradoxical first lesson shared by Taro Gold in <i>Living Wabi Sabi: The True Beauty of Your Life</i>. What is Wabi Sabi?

In a bravura performance, Andrew Graham-Dixon delves into the original Italian sources, presenting fresh details about Caravaggio's sex life, his many crimes and public brawls, and the most convincing account yet published of the painter's tragic death at the age of thirty-eight. With illuminating readings of Caravaggio's infamous religious paintings, which often depict prostitutes and poor people, Graham-Dixon immerses readers in the world of Italy at the height of the Counter-Reformation and creates a masterful profile of the mercurial painter's life and work. 40 pages of full-color illustrations, 4 maps</p><p>Andrew Graham-Dixon is a prominent writer, television host, and historian.

The client, an actress, is a friend of Paul Giacomin, Spenser's surrogate son (who first appeared in 1981's <i>Early Autumn</i>). Her mother was slain by leftist radicals at a bank holdup in 1974, and now she wants to know who fired the shot. As Spenser digs into the past, he soon learns that powerful people on both sides of the law want the case left alone--badly enough to kill.<p> These death threats provide a fine excuse for Hawk, Spenser's extremely scary (yet sensitive) bad-guy pal, to tag along in nearly every scene as bodyguard. The interaction of the two friends is one of this series's familiar pleasures, as is the presence of Susan Silverman, Spenser's longtime love interest. Another pleasure is Parker's stripped-down prose, a marvel of craftsmanship as smooth as 18-year-old Scotch. (Plus we get the first meeting between Spenser and Jesse Stone, hero of another Parker series.) Alas, the whole enterprise feels a little tired. The plot never generates much sustained suspense, and the author's adoration for his central characters renders them at times almost cartoonesque. Still, <i>Back Story</i> is excellently prepared comfort food, even if it isn't five-star cuisine. <i>--Nicholas H. Allison</i></p>Robert B. Parker was the author of more than fifty books.

Millions of devoted readers have soared on the glittering wings of Anne&#x2019;s imagination, following book by book the evolution of one of science fiction&#x2019;s most beloved and honored series. Now, for the first time, Anne has invited another writer to join her in the skies of Pern, a writer with an intimate knowledge of Pern and its history: her son, Todd.<br><br><b>DRAGON&#x2019;S KIN<br></b><br>Young Kindan has no expectations other than joining his father in the mines of Camp Natalon, a coal mining settlement struggling to turn a profit far from the great Holds where the presence of dragons and their riders means safety and civilization. Mining is fraught with danger. Fortunately, the camp has a watch-wher, a creature distantly related to dragons and uniquely suited to specialized work in the dark, cold mineshafts. Kindan&#x2019;s father is the watch-wher&#x2019;s handler, and his son sometimes helps him out. But even that important job promises no opportunity outside the mine.<br><br>Then disaster strikes. In one terrible instant, Kindan loses his family and the camp loses its watch-wher. Fathers are replaced by sons in the mine&#x2013;except for Kindan, who is taken in by the camp&#x2019;s new Harper. Grieving, Kindan finds a measure of solace in a burgeoning musical talent . . . and in a new friendship with Nuella, a mysterious girl no one seems to know exists. It is Nuella who assists Kindan when he is selected to hatch and train a new watch-wher, a job that forces him to give up his dream of becoming a Harper; and it is Nuella who helps him give new meaning to his life.<br><br>Meanwhile, sparked by the tragedy, long-simmering tensions are dividing the camp. Far below the surface, a group of resentful miners hides a deadly secret. As warring factions threaten to explode, Nuella and Kindan begin to discover unknown talents in the misunderstood watch-wher&#x2013;talents that could very well save an entire Hold. During their time teaching the watch-wher, the two learn some things themselves: that even a seemingly impossible dream is never completely out of reach . . . and that light can be found even in darkness.</p><p><b>Anne McCaffrey </b>was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

He is currently working on a solo Dragonriders of Pern novel, <i>Dragonsblood</i>.<b>CHAPTER I</b><br><br>In early morning light I see, A distant dragon come to me.<br><br>Kindan was so excited that he practically bounced as he ran up to the heights where Camp Natalon kept its drum, fire beacon, and watch.<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re here! They&#x2019;re here!&#x201d; Zenor shouted down at him. Needing no further urging, Kindan put on an extra burst of speed.<br><br>Breathless, he joined his friend on the peak where they kept the watch. Looking down at the valley, he could plainly see the large drays rolling ponderously up toward the main camp. Leading them were the smaller, but bright and cheerfully painted domicile wagons owned by the caravanners.<br><br>From the watch heights, not only could he see all the way across the lake to the bend where the trail turned out of sight, but he could also see the fields on the far side of the lake, which had just been cleared, ready for their first planting of crops. Closer in, he could see where the trail forked, the more heavily traveled way heading up to the depot where the mined and bagged coal was stored, the lighter way leading toward the miners&#x2019; houses on the near side of the lake.<br><br>Most of the houses were in three rows arranged in a U shape around a central square. The open, northern end of the U faced the road. It was there that smaller spice gardens had been planted. And it was in front of those, closer to the main square, that wedding preparations were in progress&#x2014;for Kindan&#x2019;s own sister&#x2019;s wedding.<br><br>None of those houses were &#x201c;proper&#x201d; houses, built to withstand Threadfall. But Threadfall was a long way off&#x2014;another sixteen Turns&#x2014;and the miners were glad to have the temporary comfort of their own housing, convenient to the new mine.<br><br>Midway from the square to the hill was a separate house and a large shed. The house was Kindan&#x2019;s home and the shed housed Dask, the camp&#x2019;s sole remaining watch-wher. Dask was bonded to Kindan&#x2019;s father, Danil.<br><br>Hidden from the watch point by the bend of the hill was a much larger and sturdier dwelling&#x2014;the full stone hold of Natalon, the head Miner in the camp. North of it, separated by a walled-in herb garden, was a smaller but almost as well-built dwelling, the home of the camp&#x2019;s Harper.<br><br>Just beyond the Harper&#x2019;s dwelling&#x2014;the edge of which was visible from the lookout&#x2014;the hillside, a spur from the western mountain, turned abruptly and the plain in front of it rose toward the peak of the mountain, with another spur about two kilometers distant forming a valley. Two hundred meters from the bend and a hundred meters west of the lookout was the entrance to the mine.<br><br>The boys knew the valley like the backs of their hands, even though it was changing daily and Kindan had been there only six months himself. They paid no attention to the view. Today, not even the novelty of the wedding preparations interested them: The two boys had eyes only for the trader caravan winding its way around the lake below them.<br><br>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Terregar?&#x201d; Zenor asked. &#x201c;Can you see him?&#x201d;<br><br>Kindan squinted and shaded his eyes against the sun with his hand, but mostly for show. The distance was far too great to make out one person in the whole caravan.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; he answered irritably. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure he&#x2019;s down there somewhere.&#x201d;<br><br>Zenor laughed. &#x201c;Well, he&#x2019;d better be, or your Sis will kill him.&#x201d;<br><br>Kindan favored this comment with a glare. &#x201c;Hadn&#x2019;t you better get back on down and tell Natalon?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Me?&#x201d; Zenor replied. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m on watch, not a runner.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Shards!&#x201d; Kindan groaned. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m all out of breath, Zenor.&#x201d; He added in a lower tone, &#x201c;And besides, you know how much Natalon wants to hear this news.&#x201d;<br><br>Zenor&#x2019;s eyes widened. &#x201c;Oh, yeah, I do! Everyone knows that he was hoping your Sis would stay at the Camp.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Right,&#x201d; Kindan agreed. &#x201c;So just imagine how mad he&#x2019;ll be at hearing about it from me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ah, come on, Kindan,&#x201d; Zenor replied. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s good news with the bad&#x2014;that&#x2019;s a whole caravan approaching, not just a wedding.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Which he has to host,&#x201d; Kindan snapped back. He sighed. &#x201c;Well, if you insist, I&#x2019;ll go back down.&#x201d; He paused dramatically, eyeing his smaller friend. &#x201c;But Sis said that I&#x2019;ve got to wash Dask tonight.&#x201d;<br><br>Zenor&#x2019;s eyes narrowed as he considered this. &#x201c;You mean, if I do the running, you&#x2019;ll let me help wash the watch-wher?&#x201d;<br><br>Kindan grinned. &#x201c;Exactly!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You would?&#x201d; Zenor repeated hopefully. &#x201c;Your dad won&#x2019;t mind?&#x201d;<br><br>Kindan shook his head. &#x201c;Not if he doesn&#x2019;t find out, he won&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>The added enticement of doing something unsanctioned brought a gleam to Zenor&#x2019;s eyes. &#x201c;All right, I&#x2019;ll do it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Great.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course, washing a watch-wher&#x2019;s not the same as oiling a dragon,&#x201d; Zenor went on. The thought of Impressing a dragon, of becoming telepathically linked with one of Pern&#x2019;s great fire-breathing defenders, was the secret wish of every child on Pern. But dragons seemed to prefer the children of the Weyr: Only a few riders were chosen from the Holds and Crafts. And no dragon had ever visited Camp Natalon.<br><br>&#x201c;You know,&#x201d; Zenor continued, &#x201c;I saw them.&#x201d;<br><br>Everyone in Camp Natalon knew that Zenor had seen dragons; it was his favorite tale. Kindan suppressed a groan. Instead, he made encouraging noises while hoping that Zenor wouldn&#x2019;t dawdle too much longer or Natalon would be wondering at the speed of his runner&#x2014;and might remember who it was.<br><br>&#x201c;They were so beautiful! A perfect V formation. Way up high. You could see them: bronze, brown, blue, green . . .&#x201d; Zenor&#x2019;s voice faded as he recalled the memory. &#x201c;And they looked so soft&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Soft?&#x201d; Kindan interrupted, his tone full of disbelief. &#x201c;How could they look soft?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, they did! Not like your father&#x2019;s watch-wher.&#x201d;<br><br>Kindan, feeling anger on Dask&#x2019;s behalf, stomped firmly on his emotion, remembering that he still wanted Zenor to run for him.<br><br>&#x201c;Is the caravan getting closer?&#x201d; he asked, hinting broadly.<br><br>Zenor looked, nodded, and sprinted away from the watch point. &#x201c;You won&#x2019;t forget, will you?&#x201d; he called back over his shoulder.<br><br>&#x201c;Never!&#x201d; Kindan replied. He was delighted at the thought of help with what he was certain was going to be a particularly thorough bathing of the coal mine&#x2019;s only watch-wher, the night before a major wedding.<br><br> At the bottom of the hillside, after his long, warm scramble down, Zenor paused and looked back up to where Kindan was now standing watch. It was warmer in the valley and the air was thicker, partly from the moisture in the fields, and partly from the smoke already beginning to rise from the Camp&#x2019;s fires. Catching his breath, he turned to search for Miner Natalon. He steered for the largest knot of people he could find, figuring that the Camp&#x2019;s leader would be there. He was right.<br><br>Natalon was a rangy sort of a man who stood taller than the average. Zenor&#x2019;s father, Talmaric, had called Natalon a &#x201c;youngster&#x201d; once, but only in a low voice. After hearing that, Zenor had tried to imagine Natalon as young but couldn&#x2019;t. Even though Talmaric was five Turns older than Natalon, Natalon&#x2019;s twenty-six Turns might have been a full hundred when compared to Zenor&#x2019;s meager ten.<br><br>Zenor considered calling out, but there was still a lot of confusion over the right title for Natalon. He&#x2019;d be &#x201c;Lord Natalon&#x201d; if the Camp proved itself and became a proper Mine but that was still to happen and no one quite knew how to address him now. Zenor opted for worming through the crowd and grabbing at Natalon&#x2019;s sleeve.<br><br>Miner Natalon was not pleased to have someone yank on his sleeve in the middle of an argument. He looked down and saw the sweat-stained face of Talmaric&#x2019;s son but couldn&#x2019;t remember the child&#x2019;s name. It had been so much easier six months earlier, when there&#x2019;d only been himself and a few other miners seeking out a new seam of coal. But finding that seam, and still others after it, had been exactly what Natalon had hoped for&#x2014;to start a Camp and prove it into a Mine.<br><br>Talmaric&#x2019;s son yanked again. &#x201c;Yes?&#x201d; Natalon said.<br><br>&#x201c;The caravan&#x2019;s approaching, sir,&#x201d; Zenor said, hoping that &#x201c;sir&#x201d; would not affront the Camp&#x2019;s head miner.<br><br>&#x201c;How soon, lad? Don&#x2019;t you know how to make a proper report?&#x201d; a querulous voice barked above Zenor&#x2019;s ears. He turned and saw that the speaker was Tarik, Natalon&#x2019;s uncle. Zenor had had several encounters with Tarik&#x2019;s son, Cristov, and still bore bruises from the last meeting.<br><br>Rumor had it that Tarik was furious that Crom Hold&#x2019;s MasterMiner hadn&#x2019;t put him in charge of seeking out new coal. Another rumor, whispered quietly among only a few of the Camp&#x2019;s boys, was that Tarik was doing everything in his power to prove that Natalon was unsuited to run the Camp and that he, Tarik, should be placed in charge. The last set of bruises Zenor had got from Cristov were the result of an ill-placed comment about Cristov&#x2019;s father.<br><br>&#x201c;How long until they arrive, Zenor?&#x201d; a kinder voice asked. It was Danil, Kindan&#x2019;s father, and the partner of the Camp&#x2019;s only surviving watch-wher.<br><br>&#x201c;I spotted them at the head of the valley,&#x201d; Zenor replied. &#x201c;I imagine it&#x2019;ll be four, maybe six hours until they reach the camp.&#x201d;<br>...</p><h2>Artist&#39;s Photo Reference: Flowers</h2><p>Contains more than 500 photos of 49 different types of flowers.

It is where the bitter opera of Cuban exile intersects with the cynicism of U.S. foreign policy. It is a city whose skyrocketing murder rate is fueled by the cocaine trade, racial discontent, and an undeclared war on the island ninety miles to the south. <br><br>As Didion follows Miami's drift into a Third World capital, she also locates its position in the secret history of the Cold War, from the Bay of Pigs to the Reagan doctrine and from the Kennedy assassination to the Watergate break-in. <b>Miami</b> is not just a portrait of a city, but a masterly study of immigration and exile, passion, hypocrisy, and political violence.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>"[Didion's] prose is...finely tuned.... [Miami] turns much sunny light into a murky underwater darkness full of sharks and evil shadows."--New York Times<br><br>"Miami is a kaleidoscope of impressions, and a litany of violence, intrigue, vengeance, and political manipulation, and broken dreams."--Boston Globe</p><h2>Secrets of Eskimo Skin Sewing</h2><p>Still the definitive guide, <i>Secrets of Eskimo Skin Sewing</i> is packed with clear, easy-to-understand instructions, drawings, and photographs to lead readers of any skill level through the process of turning natural or man-made furs and hides into handsome, useful garments. Author Edna Wilder, one of the world's best-known practitioners and modernizers of traditional Eskimo skin sewing techniques, takes would-be skin sewers through the step-by-step work involved in constructing traditional items of clothing such as mukluks, parkas, and mittens. She also includes sewing instructions for belts, baby booties, a trapper-style fur cap, and toys.<br>Though natural fur and hides were the only ones known in traditional Eskimo lifeways, the book's guidance is completely adaptable to modern, synthetic leathers and artificial furs. Similarly, the guidance offered in these pages on traditional Native beadwork and basket making works just as well for plastic beads and basketry materials unknown to the Alaska wilderness.</p><p></p><h2>Undeniable: How Biology Confirms Our Intuition That Life Is Designed</h2><p><p><strong>Named A Best Book of the Year by <em>World Magazine</em></strong></p><p>Throughout his distinguished and unconventional career, engineer-turned-molecular-biologist Douglas Axe has been asking the questions that much of the scientific community would rather silence.

Space opera and military-esque adventure (and a number of other things one can best discover for oneself), <i>The Warrior's Apprentice</i> makes another good place to jump into the series for readers who prefer a young male protagonist.<br> &nbsp;<br> After that: <i>Brothers in Arms</i> should be read before <i>Mirror Dance</i>, and both, ideally, before <i>Memory.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Komarr</i> makes another good alternate entry point for the series, picking up Miles's second career at its start.&nbsp; It should be read before <i>A Civil Campaign</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Borders of Infinity</i>, a collection of three of the five currently extant novellas, makes a good Miles Vorkosigan early-adventure sampler platter, I always thought, for readers who don't want to commit themselves to length.&nbsp; (But it may make more sense if read after <i>The Warrior's Apprentice</i>.)&nbsp; Take care not to confuse the collection-as-a-whole with its title story, "The Borders of Infinity".<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Falling Free</i> takes place 200 years earlier in the timeline and does not share settings or characters with the main body of the series.&nbsp; Most readers recommend picking up this story later. It should likely be read before <i>Diplomatic Immunity</i>, however, which revisits the "quaddies", a bioengineered race of free fall dwellers, in Miles's time.<br> &nbsp;<br> The novels in the internal-chronological list below appear in italics; the novellas (officially defined as a story between 17,500 words and 40,000 words, though mine usually run 20k - 30k words) in quote marks.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Falling Free</i><br> <i>Shards of Honor</i><br> <i>Barrayar</i><br> <i>The Warrior's Apprentice</i><br> "The Mountains of Mourning"<br> "Weatherman"<br> <i>The Vor Game</i><br> <i>Cetaganda</i><br> <i>Ethan of Athos</i><br> <i>Borders of Infinity</i><br> "Labyrinth"<br> "The Borders of Infinity" <br> <i>Brothers in Arms</i><br> <i>Mirror Dance</i><br> <i>Memory</i><br> <i>Komarr</i><br> <i>A Civil Campaign</i><br> "Winterfair Gifts"<br> <i>Diplomatic Immunity</i><br> <i>Captain Vorpatril's </i><i>Alliance</i><i>&nbsp; </i>(upcoming in late 2012)<br> <i>CryoBurn</i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br> Caveats:<br> &nbsp;<br> The novella "Weatherman" is an out-take from the beginning of the novel <i>The Vor Game</i>.&nbsp; If you already have <i>The Vor Game</i>, you likely don't need this.<br> &nbsp;<br> The original 'novel' <i>Borders of Infinity</i> was a fix-up collection containing the three novellas "The Mountains of Mourning", "Labyrinth", and "The Borders of Infinity", together with a frame story to tie the pieces together. Again, beware duplication.&nbsp; The frame story does not stand alone, and generally is of interest only to completists.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>The Fantasy Novels</b><br> &nbsp;<br> My fantasy novels are a bit easier to order.&nbsp; Easiest of all is <i>The Spirit Ring</i>, which is a stand-alone, or aquel, as some wag once dubbed books that for some obscure reason failed to spawn a subsequent series.&nbsp; Next easiest are the four volumes of <i>The Sharing Knife</i>--in order, <i>Beguilement</i>, <i>Legacy</i>, <i>Passage</i>, and <i>Horizon</i>--which I broke down and actually numbered, as this was one continuous tale divided into non-wrist-breaking chunks.<br> &nbsp;<br> What have come to be called the Chalion books, after the setting of its first two volumes, were also written, like the Vorkosigan books, to be stand-alones as part of a larger whole, and can in theory be read in any order.&nbsp; (The third book actually takes place a few hundred years prior to the more closely connected first two.)&nbsp; Some readers think the world-building is easier to assimilate when the books are read in publication order, and the second volume certainly contains spoilers for the first (but not the third.)&nbsp; In any case, the publication order is:<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>The Curse of Chalion</i><br> <i>Paladin of Souls</i><br> <i>The Hallowed Hunt</i><br> &nbsp;<br> Happy reading!<br> &nbsp;<br> -- Lois McMaster Bujold.Lois McMaster Bujold is one of the most honored writers in the fields of science fiction and fantasy and has won six Hugo Awards and two Nebula Awards, including a Nebula Award for <i>Falling Free</i>, included in <i>Miles and Metallurgy</i>.

Jones, an amoral bisexual who has tumbled from the jet-set heights, are accompanied by an introduction by the editor</p><p>As it follows the career of a writer of uncertain parentage and omnivorous erotic tastes, Answered Prayers careens from a louche bar in Tangiers to a banquette at La Cote Basque, from literary salons to highpriced whorehouses. It takes in calculating beauties and sadistic husbands along with such real-life supporting characters as Colette, the Duchess of Windsor, Montgomery Clift, and Tallulah Bankhead. Above all, this malevolently funny book displays Capote at his most relentlessly observant and murderously witty.<b>Truman Capote </b>was born September 30, 1924, in New Orleans. After his parents&#x2019; divorce, he was sent to live with relatives in Monroeville, Alabama. It was here he would meet his lifelong friend, the author Harper Lee. Capote rose to international prominence in 1948 with the publication of his debut novel, Other Voices, Other Rooms. Among his celebrated works are <i>Breakfast at Tiffany&#x2019;s, A Tree of Night, The Grass Harp, Summer Crossing, A Christmas Memory,</i> and <i>In Cold Blood,</i> widely considered one of the greatest books of the twentieth century. Twice awarded the O. Henry Short Story Prize, Capote was also the recipient of a National Institute of Arts and Letters Creative Writing Award and an Edgar Award.

She grew up in Manhattan Beach, California, two blocks from the beach and she always loved to make up stories. Her first rejection letter at age eleven was for a poem she wrote in class when she was supposed to be doing a math assignment. She's had a myriad of odd jobs: telephone operator, lifeguard, camp counselor, reporter, book reviewer &amp; columnist for the LA Times. Kristiana and her husband live in Idaho with their golden retriever, Poppy. Their two adult sons visit often. In her spare time she loves to swim, hike, watch clouds, do yoga, read &amp; hang out with friends. For all her titles, please visit her website: www.kristianagregory.comGrade 5-8-Fourteen-year-old Susanna Fairchild and her family embark on a journey that they hope will bring them good fortune. Boarding a ship sailing from New York to the West, the Fairchilds set out for Oregon where they plan to start a new life. Tragedy strikes when Susanna's mother is lost at sea, and they must continue on without her. Hearing stories of enormous wealth, Susanna's physician father decides to join the hordes of men rushing to California to mine for gold. The trials and tribulations encountered by the many men who risked their lives for the chance to become rich are wonderfully envisioned by the author. The uncharted West with its many hazards is descriptively brought to life through the diary writings of Susanna, who proves to be up to the task of surviving the rugged lifestyle her father has chosen for them. A strong female voice takes readers on an adventure filled with sorrow for the loss of her mother, love for her father and sister, and a determination to make a home amid the wilderness. Secondary characters are nicely interspersed throughout the story. Historical notes, drawings, a recipe for "Miner's Griddle Cakes," and a map of the gold-mining region provide a fitting conclusion to an interesting story.<br><i>Janet Gillen, Great Neck Public Library, NY </i><br>Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Inheritance of Rome: Illuminating the Dark Ages, 400-1000 (PENGUIN HISTORY OF EUROPE)</h2><p><b>An ambitious and enlightening look at why the so-called Dark Ages were anything but that</b><br><br>Prizewinning historian Chris Wickham defies the conventional view of the Dark Ages in European history with a work of remarkable scope and rigorous yet accessible scholarship. Drawing on a wealth of new material and featuring a thoughtful synthesis of historical and archaeological approaches, Wickham argues that these centuries were critical in the formulation of European identity. Far from being a middle period between more significant epochs, this age has much to tell us in its own right about the progress of culture and the development of political thought.<br><br> Sweeping in its breadth, Wickham's incisive history focuses on a world still profoundly shaped by Rome, which encompassed the remarkable Byzantine, Carolingian, and Ottonian empires, and peoples ranging from Goths, Franks, and Vandals to Arabs, Anglo- Saxons, and Vikings. Digging deep into each culture, Wickham constructs a vivid portrait of a vast and varied world stretching from Ireland to Constantinople, the Baltic to the Mediterranean. <i>The Inheritance of Rome</i> brilliantly presents a fresh understanding of the crucible in which Europe would ultimately be created.<br><br></p><p><b>Chris Wickham</b> is Chichele Professor of Medieval History at the University of Oxford and a Fellow of All Souls College. His book <i>Framing the Middle Ages</i> won the Wolfson Prize, the Deutscher Memorial Prize, and the James Henry Breasted Prize of the American Historical Association.Starred Review. Building on the foundation he laid in <i>Framing the Early Middle Ages</i>, award-winning Oxford historian Wickham constructs a magisterial narrative of the political, economic, cultural and religious fabrics that constituted the crazy quilt of Europe's Dark Ages. Negating what he calls a common teleological view of this period as the source of European nations and a modern sense of European identity, he draws on archeological evidence and rich historiographical methods Wickham challenges standard views of the early Middle Ages as barbarous and bereft of political and cultural structure, and recreates a stunning portrait of the breakup of the Roman Empire and its consequences for Europe. Wickham looks at the immediate post-Roman polities in Gaul, Spain and Italy; the history of Byzantium, the Arab caliphate and its 10th-century successor states, including Muslim Spain; the Carolingian Empire and its successors and imitators, notably Russia and Scotland. Under this narrative layer lies a focus on the accumulation of wealth, the institutionalization of politics and the culture of the public. Wickham's achievement contributes richly to our picture of this often narrowly understood period.

He lives in Scotland.Chapter One <br><br>Mr. Molofololo <br><br>Traditionally built people may not look as if they are great walkers, but there was a time when Precious Ramotswe walked four miles a day. As a girl in Mochudi, all those years ago, a pupil at the school that looked down over the sprawling village below, she went to her lessons every morning on foot, joining the trickle of children that made its way up the hill, the girls in blue tunics, the boys in khaki shirts and shorts, like little soldiers. The journey from the house where she lived with her father and the older cousin who looked after her took all of an hour, except, of course, when she was lucky and managed to ride on the mule-drawn water cart that occasionally passed that way. The driver of this cart, with whom her father had worked in the gold mines as a young man, knew who she was and always slowed down to allow her to clamber up on the driver&#x2019;s seat beside him.<br><br>Other children would watch enviously and try to wave down the water cart. &#x201c;I cannot carry all Botswana,&#x201d; said the driver. &#x201c;If I gave all you children a ride on my cart, then my poor mules would die. Their hearts would burst. I cannot allow that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But you have Precious up there!&#x201d; called out the boys. &#x201c;Why is she so special?&#x201d;<br><br>The driver looked at Precious and winked. &#x201c;Tell them why you are special, Precious. Explain it to them.&#x201d;<br><br>The young Mma Ramotswe, barely eight, was overwhelmed by embarrassment.<br><br>&#x201c;But I am not special. I am just a girl.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You are the daughter of Obed Ramotswe,&#x201d; said the driver. &#x201c;He is a great man. That is why you are riding up here.&#x201d;<br><br>He was right, of course&#x2014;at least in what he said about Obed Ramotswe, who was, by any standards, a fine man. At that age, Precious had only a faint inkling of what her father stood for; later on, as a young woman, she would come to understand what it was to be the daughter of Obed Ramotswe. But in those days, on the way to school, whether riding in state on the water cart or walking along the side of that dusty road with her friends, she had school to think about, with its lessons on so many subjects&#x2014;the history of Botswana, from the beginning, when it was known as Khama&#x2019;s country, across the plains of which great lions walked, to the emergence of the new Botswana, then still a chrysalis in a dangerous world; writing lessons, with the letters of the alphabet being described in white chalk on an ancient blackboard, all whirls and loops; arithmetic, with its puzzling multiplication tables that needed to be learned by heart&#x2014;when there was so much else that the heart had to learn.<br><br>The water cart, of course, did not pass very often, and so on most days there was a long trudge to school and a long walk back. Some children had an even greater journey; in one class there was a boy who walked seven miles there and seven miles back, even in the hottest of months, when the sun came down upon Botswana like a pounding fist, when the cattle huddled together under the umbrella shade of the acacia trees, not daring to wander off in search of what scraps of grass remained. This boy thought nothing of his daily journey; this is what you did if you wanted to go to school to learn the things that your parents had never had the chance to learn. And you did not complain, even if during the rainy season you might narrowly escape being struck by lightning or being washed away by the torrents that rose in the previously dry watercourses. You did not complain in that Botswana.<br><br>Now, of course, it was different, and it was the contemplation of these differences that made Mma Ramotswe think about walking again.<br><br>&#x201c;We are becoming lazy, Mma Ramotswe,&#x201d; said Mma Makutsi one afternoon, as they sipped their afternoon cup of red bush tea in the offices of the No. 1 Ladies&#x2019; Detective Agency. &#x201c;Have you noticed? We are becoming lazy.&#x201d;<br><br>Mma Ramotswe frowned. There were times when Mma Makutsi made statements that suffered from that classic flaw of all generalisations&#x2014;they were just too general. This observation, it seemed to her, could be such a remark.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you mean that you and I are becoming lazy?&#x201d; she asked her assistant. &#x201c;If you do, then I do not think that&#x2019;s right, Mma Makutsi. Take this morning, for instance. We finished that report on security at the loan office. And we wrote a lot of letters. Six, seven, I think. That is not being lazy.&#x201d;<br><br>Mma Makutsi raised a hand in protest. &#x201c;No, Mma, I did not mean that. I did not mean to say that you and I are becoming lazy. Or not specially lazy. I am talking about everybody.&#x201d;<br><br>Mma Ramotswe raised an eyebrow. &#x201c;The whole of Botswana?&#x201d;<br><br>Mma Makutsi nodded. &#x201c;Yes, the whole country. And it&#x2019;s not just Botswana, Mma. We are no worse than anybody else. In fact, I am sure that there are many much lazier countries elsewhere. What I really meant was that people in general are becoming lazy.&#x201d;<br><br>Mma Ramotswe, who had been prepared to defend Botswana against Mma Makutsi&#x2019;s accusations, relaxed. If the remark was about people in general, and not just about the residents of Gaborone, then Mma Makutsi&#x2019;s theory could at least be heard out. &#x201c;Why do you say that people are becoming lazy, Mma?&#x201d; she asked.<br><br>Mma Makutsi glanced through the half-open door that led from the agency into the garage. On the other side of the workshop, Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni was showing his two apprentices an engine part. &#x201c;You see those two boys out there?&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Charlie and . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Fanwell,&#x201d; supplied Mma Ramotswe. &#x201c;We must start using his name. It is not kind to be forgetting it all the time.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, Charlie and . . . Fanwell,&#x201d; said Mma Makutsi. &#x201c;It is a stupid name, though, don&#x2019;t you think, Mma? Why would anybody be called Fanwell?&#x201d;<br><br>Mma Ramotswe could not let this pass. Mma Makutsi was too hard on the two apprentices, particularly on the older one, Charlie. Words had passed between them more than once, including on the occasion when Charlie had called Mma Makutsi a warthog and made disparaging references to her large glasses. It had been quite wrong of him, and Mma Ramotswe had made that plain, but she had also acknowledged that he had been provoked. &#x201c;They are young men,&#x201d; she had said to Mma Makutsi. &#x201c;That is what young men are like, Mma. Their heads are full of loud music and thoughts of girls. Imagine walking around with all that nonsense in your head.&#x201d;<br><br>That had been said in defence of Charlie; now it was necessary to say something for Fanwell. It was wrong of Mma Makutsi, she thought, to poke fun at Fanwell&#x2019;s name. &#x201c;Why is anybody called anything, Mma Makutsi? That boy cannot help it. It is the parents who give children stupid names. It is the fault of the parents.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But Fanwell, Mma Ramotswe? What a silly name. Why did they not call him Fanbelt? That would be a good name for an apprentice mechanic, wouldn&#x2019;t it? Hah! Fanbelt. That would be very funny.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, Mma Makutsi,&#x201d; said Mma Ramotswe. &#x201c;We must not make fun of people&#x2019;s names. There are some who think that your own name, Grace, is a strange name. I do not think that, of course. But there are probably people like that.&#x201d;<br><br>Mma Makutsi was dismissive. &#x201c;Then they are very foolish,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;They should know better.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And that is what Fanwell himself would probably say about anybody who laughed at his name,&#x201d; Mma Ramotswe pointed out.<br><br>Mma Makutsi had to agree with this, even if reluctantly. She and Mma Ramotswe were fortunate, with their reasonably straightforward names of Grace and Precious, respectively; she had contemporaries who were not so fortunate and had been saddled by their parents with names that were frankly ridiculous. One boy she had known at school had borne a Setswana name which meant <i>Look out, the police have arrived</i>. The poor boy had been the object of derision amongst his classmates and had tried, unsuccessfully, to change the name by which he was known. But names, like false allegations, stick, and he had gone through life with this unfortunate burden, reminded of it every time he had to give details for an official form; looking away so that the person examining the form could be given the opportunity to smile, which they all did.<br><br>&#x201c;Even if their names are not their fault,&#x201d; said Mma Makutsi, &#x201c;the way those boys behave<i> is</i> their fault, Mma. There can be no doubt about that. And those boys are very lazy, Mma. They are examples of what I am talking about.&#x201d;<br><br>She looked sternly at Mma Ramotswe, as if challenging her employer to contradict her. Mma Ramotswe did not rise to the bait; Mma Makutsi was rather assertive&#x2014;and she admired the younger woman for that&#x2014;but it did not help, she had decided, to engage with her too much when she was in mid-theory. It was best to let people have their say, she always felt; then, when they had finished, and had possibly run out of breath, one could always lodge a mild objection to what had been said before.<br><br>Mma Makutsi peered in the direction of the garage and lowered her voice. &#x201c;Have you ever seen those two young men walk- ing?&#x201d; she asked.<br><br>Mma Ramotswe frowned. Of course she had seen the apprentices walking; they walked about the garage, they came into the office to collect their tea, they walked to the tree under which Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni&#x2019;s truck was parked. She pointed this out to Mma Makutsi, gently enough, but not so mildly as to prevent a firm refutation from the other side of the room.<br><br>&#x201c;Not that sort of walking, Mma,&#x201d; said Mma Makutsi. &#x201c;Anybody can walk across a room or round a garage. Anybody, Mma. Even those two lazy young men. The sort of walking I&#x2019;m talking about is walking from one place to another. Walking to work. Walking from the middle of town to the National Stadium. Walking from Kgale Siding to Gaborone. That sort of walking.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Those are not short walks,&#x201d; said Mma Ramotswe. &#x201c;Although it would not take too long, I think, to get from the middle of town to the Stadium. Perhaps twenty-five minutes if it was not too hot.&#x201d;<br><br>Mma Makutsi sniffed. &#x201c;How can we tell?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;These days nobody would know how long it takes to walk anywhere because we have all stopped walking, Mma. We know how long it takes to drive. We know how long a minibus takes. But we do not know how long it takes to walk.&#x201d;<br><br>Mma Ramotswe was silent as she thought about this. She had long understood that one of the features of Mma Makutsi&#x2019;s speeches was that there was often a grain of truth in them, and sometimes even more than that.<br><br>&#x201c;And here&#x2019;s another thing, Mma Ramotswe,&#x201d; Mma Makutsi continued. &#x201c;Have you heard of evolution? Well, what will happen if we all carry on being lazy like this and drive everywhere? I can tell you, Mma. We shall start to grow wheels. That is what evolution is all about.&#x201d;</p><h2>Secrets of the Samurai: A Survey of the Martial Arts of Feudal Japan</h2><p>History.

They had said that it was going to be easy and, like the fool I am, I believed them. They said that if things got rough to make sure I showed the pictures, of which there were only twenty-three; I had already shown all of them twice. &#x201c;&#x2018;Long, long ago, there lived a king and queen...&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>I looked around the room for a little backup, but there wasn&#x2019;t anyone there. They had said that I didn&#x2019;t have to worry, that they wouldn&#x2019;t leave me alone, but they had. &#x201c;&#x2018;...who didn&#x2019;t have any children. One day, the queen was visited by a wise fairy, who told her, &#x201c;You will have a lovely baby girl.&#x201d; The king was so overjoyed when he heard the news that he immediately made plans for a great feast. He invited not only his relatives, but also the twelve fairies who lived in the kingdom.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s your gun?&#x201d;</p><p>My thought exactly. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t think I was going to need it.&#x201d; They all nodded, but I wasn&#x2019;t particularly sure they agreed.</p><p>&#x201c;How long have you been a sheriff?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Twenty-three years.&#x201d; It just seemed like a million.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you know Buffalo Bill?&#x201d;</p><p>Maybe it was a million. &#x201c;No, he was a little before my time.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My daddy says you&#x2019;re a butt hole.&#x201d;</p><p>I looked down at the battered book in my hands. &#x201c;Okay, maybe we should concentrate on today&#x2019;s story...&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He says you used to drive around drunk all the time...&#x201d;</p><p>The instigator in the front row looked like a little angel but had a mouth like a stevedore. He was getting ready to say something else, so I cut him off by holding up Grimm&#x2019;s Fairy Tales open to the page where the young princess had been enchanted and put to sleep for a hundred years. &#x201c;Why do you think the fairy visited the queen?&#x201d; A dark-haired girl with enormous eyes who sat in the third row slowly raised her hand. &#x201c;You?&#x201d;</p><p>She cocked her head in disgust. &#x201c;I told you, my name is Anne.&#x201d;</p><p>I nodded mine in contrition. &#x201c;Right. Anne, why do you think the fairy visited the queen?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because their daughter is going to fall asleep.&#x201d; She said it slowly, with the hearty contempt even young people have for civil servants who can&#x2019;t get it right.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, yep, but that happens later on because one of the fairies gets angry, right?&#x201d; Anne raised her hand again, but I ignored her for a slight redheaded boy in the back. His name was Rusty, and I quietly thanked the powers that be for word association. &#x201c;Rusty?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My dad says that my Uncle Paul is a fairy.&#x201d;</p><p>I&#x2019;m not sure when it was that my storytelling abilities began to atrophy, but it must have been somewhere between Sesame Street and The Electric Company. I think I used to be pretty good at it, but that was a long time ago. I was going to have to ask my daughter if that really was the case; she was now &#x201c;The Greatest Legal Mind of Our Time&#x201d; and a Philadelphia lawyer. When I had spoken to Cady last night, she had still been at the office library in the basement. I felt sorry for her till she told me the basement was on the twenty-eighth floor. My friend Henry Standing Bear said that the law library was where all the lawyers went to sleep at about $250 an hour.</p><p>&#x201c;You are the worstest storyteller we ever had.&#x201d;</p><p>I looked down at another would-be literary critic who had been silent up till now and wondered if maybe I had made a mistake with &#x201c;Brier Rose.&#x201d; Cady had loved the story dearly at an earlier age, but the current enrollment appeared to be a little sophisticated for the material.</p><p>&#x201c;My daddy hides his medicine whenever anybody knocks on our door.&#x201d;</p><p>I tried not to concentrate on this child&#x2019;s name. I propped the book back up on my knee and looked at all of them, the future of Absaroka County, Wyoming.</p><p>&#x201c;He says he doesn&#x2019;t have a prescription.&#x201d;</p><p>I was supposed to make the drive to Philadelphia tomorrow with Henry. He had received an invitation to lecture at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts with his Mennonite photograph collection in tow. I thought it would be an opportunity to visit my daughter and meet the lawyer who was the latest of her conquests. The relationship had lasted about four months, a personal record for her, so I decided that it was time I met the prospective son-in-law.</p><p>&#x201c;His medicine makes him fall down.&#x201d;</p><p>Henry was planning on driving Lola. I had tried to talk him into flying, but it had been a while since he had driven across the country and he said he wanted to check things out. The real reason was he wanted to make an entrance with the powder blue 1959 Thunderbird convertible; the Bear was big on entrances.</p><p>&#x201c;He smokes his medicine.&#x201d;</p><p>We were going for only a week, but Cady was very excited about introducing us to Devon Conliffe, who sounded like a character from The Philadelphia Story. I had warned her that lawyers shouldn&#x2019;t marry other lawyers, that it only led to imbecile paralegals.</p><p>&#x201c;My mommy says the only thing his medicine does is keep him from getting a job.&#x201d;</p><p>Patti with an &#x201c;i,&#x201d; my daughter&#x2019;s secretary, agreed with me about lawyer interbreeding. We had talked about the relationship, and I could just make out a little reservation in Patti&#x2019;s voice when she mentioned him.</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s my third daddy.&#x201d;</p><p>We were supposed to have dinner with the elder Conliffes at their palatial home in Bryn Mawr, an event I was looking forward to like a subcutaneous wound.</p><p>&#x201c;I liked my second daddy best.&#x201d;</p><p>It would be interesting to see their response to the Indian and his faithful sidekick, the sheriff of Absaroka County. They probably wouldn&#x2019;t open the gate.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t remember my first daddy.&#x201d;</p><p>I looked up at the kid and reopened the book. &#x201c;&#x2018;Long, long ago, there lived a king and queen who didn&#x2019;t have any children...&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dorothy Caldwell turned toward the patties on the griddle behind her, lifted the press, and turned them. &#x201c;What&#x2019;d you read?&#x201d;</p><p>I pulled Cady&#x2019;s personal copy from the stool beside me and sat it on the counter. Grimm&#x2019;s Fairy Tales. &#x201c;Brier Rose&#x201d;&#x2014;&#x201c;Sleeping Beauty&#x201d; before Hollywood got hold of it.</p><p>She gave me a sideways look and then leaned over to glance at the love-worn cover. &#x201c;Kindergarten?&#x201d; She shrugged a shoulder as she placed the meat press aside. &#x201c;Kids have gotten a little jaded since Cady&#x2019;s generation, Walter.&#x201d;</p><p>I set my glass down. &#x201c;Well, I don&#x2019;t have to do it again until after the election.&#x201d; She slipped the hamburger, lettuce, tomato, and bacon onto a toasted bun and slid the plate toward me. &#x201c;The usual?&#x201d;</p><p>She nodded at the old joke, sipped at her own tea, and peeked at me over the rim. &#x201c;I hear Kyle Straub is going to run.&#x201d;</p><p>I nodded and put mayonnaise on my burger, a practice she hated. &#x201c;Yep, I&#x2019;ve seen the signs.&#x201d; The prosecuting attorney had jumped the gun this morning and placed his red-white-and-blue signs in all the strategic spots around town before finding out for sure if I was really going to run again. So far, it had been the strongest motivation that I had had to continue my tenure.</p><p>&#x201c;Prosecuting attorney/sheriff.&#x201d; She paused for effect. &#x201c;Kind of gives you an indication as to what his administration would be like.&#x201d;</p><p>I thought about my original plan, to run for sheriff, put in half a term, and then hand the reins over to Vic, allowing her to prove herself for two years before having to face a general election. I chewed a chunk of burger. &#x201c;You think Vic would make a good sheriff?&#x201d;</p><p>Dorothy slipped a wayward lock behind her ear and looked past me. Her hair was getting longer, and I wondered if she was growing it out. The answer to my question about Vic, like everything else about Dorothy, was definitive. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t we ask her?&#x201d;</p><p>I fought the urge to turn and look out onto Main Street, where I&#x2019;m sure a handsome, dark-haired woman was parking a ten-year-old unit in front of the Busy Bee Cafe. Wyoming had never elected a female sheriff and the chances of their electing an Italian from Philadelphia with a mouth like a saltwater crocodile were relatively slim.</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s got the Basquo with her.&#x201d; There was a pause as I continued eating my lunch. &#x201c;Those two are quite the pair.&#x201d;</p><p>Santiago Saizarbitoria had joined our little contingency three months ago and, with the exception of trying to put out a chimney fire single-handedly on an ice-slicked roof, had proven himself indispensable. I listened as the door opened and closed, the laden April air drifting through the brief opening. They sat on the stools beside me and threw their elbows onto the counter. In identical uniforms and service jackets, they could have been twins, except that the Basquo was bigger, with wrists like bundled cables, and had a goatee, and he didn&#x2019;t have the tarnished gold eyes that Vic had.</p><p>I kept eating as Dorothy pulled two mugs from under the counter, poured them full, and pushed the cream dispenser and the sugar toward the old world pair. They both drank coffee all day. Vic slipped her finger through the handle of her cup. &#x201c;How was this afternoon&#x2019;s premiere at Durant Elementary?&#x201d;</p><p>I took another sip of my iced tea. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think we&#x2019;ll make the long run.&#x201d;</p><p>She tore open five sugars and dumped them in her mug. &#x201c;I been here two years. How come they never fucking asked me?&#x201d;</p><p>I set my glass back down. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s hard to read nursery rhymes with a tape delay.&#x201d;</p><p>She stirred the coffee into the sugar and spoke into the mug. &#x201c;That monkey pud Kyle Straub&#x2019;s got signs up all over town.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yep, I heard.&#x201d;</p><p>Saizarbitoria leaned in and joined the conversation. &#x201c;Vern Selby was talking very highly about Mr. Straub in the paper yesterday.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yep, I read it.&#x201d;</p><p>All our radios blared for a second. Static. &#x201c;Unit two, 10-54 at 16, mile marker four.&#x201d;</p><p>We looked at one another. Ruby had made a crusade of using the ten code in the last few weeks, and it was turning out to be a royal pain in the ass for all of us. I was the first one to guess. &#x201c;Intoxicated driver?&#x201d;</p><p>Vic was next. &#x201c;Road blocked...&#x201d;</p><p>Saizarbitoria took one last sip of his coffee and slipped off his stool; he knew the chain of command. He clicked the mic on his radio. &#x201c;Ten fifty-four, roger.&#x201d; He looked at the two of us and shook his head. &#x201c;Livestock on the road.&#x201d;</p><p>Vic and I shrugged at each other as she tossed him the keys. She sipped her sugar as he hurried out. &#x201c;Do let us know.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Vic hitched a ride with me. As we walked up the steps of the old Carnegie Library that housed the Absaroka County jail and offices, I could smell her shampoo and the crab apple blossoms. We were about halfway up the steps when she stopped me with a hand on my arm. I turned to look at her as she leaned against the iron railing and slid that same hand up the black-painted steel bar. I waited, but she just looked off toward Clear Creek, where the cottonwoods were already starting to leaf. She glanced back at me, irritated. &#x201c;You still planning on leaving tomorrow morning?&#x201d;</p><p>I adjusted the book of fairy tales under my arm. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the plan, at least mine.&#x201d;</p><p>She nodded. &#x201c;I have a favor to ask.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d;</p><p>She sniffed, and I watched as the wrinkles receded from the sides of her nose like cat whiskers. &#x201c;My mother wants to have lunch with you and Cady.&#x201d;</p><p>I waited a moment, thinking there must be more. &#x201c;Okay.&#x201d;</p><p>She continued to look off toward the creek. &#x201c;Super Cop might be too busy, but my mother is feeling negligent in her attentions toward your daughter.&#x201d; I watched as the muscles of her jaw flexed like they always did when she mentioned her father.</p><p>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I mean...It&#x2019;s not a big deal. She just wants to have lunch.&#x201d;</p><p>I nodded again. &#x201c;Okay.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You can go to my Uncle Alphonse&#x2019;s pizzeria&#x2014;it&#x2019;s nothing special.&#x201d;</p><p>I smiled and dipped my head to block her view. &#x201c;I said okay.&#x201d;</p><p>She looked at me. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a family thing, and like most of the family things concerning my family, it&#x2019;s fucked up.&#x201d; She sighed. &#x201c;I mean...they should have gotten in touch with her a long time before this, but in their usual, fucked-up way...&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll have lunch.&#x201d; I watched as she studied her Browning tactical boots. Her dark hair stood up in tufts of dissatisfaction. &#x201c;I would love to meet any of your family.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Uh huh.&#x201d; Nothing was ever easy with Vic; it was one of her charms. She started up the steps without me. &#x201c;Just don&#x2019;t expect too much.&#x201d;</p><p>I shook my head, followed her, and caught the beveled-glass door as it swung back into my face. I gently closed it and walked by the photographs of the five previous Absaroka County sheriffs. I saluted the painting of Andrew Carnegie as I mounted the final steps to the dispatcher&#x2019;s desk where Ruby sat reading the last series of updates from the Division of Criminal Investigation down in Cheyenne. &#x201c;What the hell is a 10-54?&#x201d;</p><p>She raised her blue eyes and gazed at me through her salt-with-no-pepper bangs. &#x201c;Ferg says that he&#x2019;s 10-6 today if he&#x2019;s got to work the next week and a half solid, and I&#x2019;m 10-42 as of five forty-five for my church&#x2019;s ice-cream social.&#x201d;</p><p>I decided to ignore the flurry of tens. &#x201c;Did he go up to Tongue River Canyon?&#x201d; She nodded. The Ferg was my part-time deputy who made a full-time habit of harassing the local aquatic life with his hand-tied flies. He was going to have to take up some of the slack while I was gone, so I didn&#x2019;t begrudge him a day casting bits of fur and feather upon the waters. &#x201c;Any Post-its?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Two, and that young man who is supposed to come in this afternoon.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What young man?&#x201d;</p><p>She shook her head. &#x201c;The young man from Sheridan who applied for the other deputy position in Powder Junction.

E. B. Du Bois: Biography of a Race, 1868-1919</h2><p>A definitive biography of the African-American author and scholar describes Du Bois&#39;s formative years, the evolution of his philosophy, and his roles as a founder of the NAACP and architect of the American civil rights movement. 35,000 first printing. $35,000 ad/promo. Tour.</p><p>W.E.B. Du Bois--the first African-American to earn a doctorate at Harvard, one of the founders of the NAACP, visionary Pan-Africanist intellectual, and author of the seminal text The Souls of Black Folks--has not received due honor in his own country because of his radicalism in later life. Du Bois, hounded during the McCarthy era for his left wing beliefs, eventually gave up his American citizenship. But as a revered leader of black people worldwide, Du Bois merited a state funeral in Ghana when he died there in 1963. This first volume in Lewis&#39;s biography, winner of the 1994 Pulitzer Prize, details Du Bois&#39; early life and work, up to the landmark Pan-African Congress following World War I, which brought &#34;black liberation&#34; to world attention.William Edward Burghardt Du Bois (1868-1963) has finally found a Boswell worthy of his achievements as an African-American reformer who fought for human rights in the US and the wider world. In the first part of a projected two-volume biography, Rutgers history professor Lewis (The Race to Fashoda, 1988, etc.) offers a detailed chronicle that puts the eventful origins of a towering figure clearly in the perspective of his troubled times. Born in western Massachusetts less than three years after the abolition of slavery, Du Bois managed to earn a doctorate in history from Harvard. After graduating, he pursued one of the few careers open to educated blacks, that of teaching--at Atlanta University and other institutions. Meanwhile, he published pioneering sociological studies (The Philadelphia Negro, etc.), arranged symposiums, and helped found the Niagara Movement--an all- black group that in 1909 joined forces with liberal whites to form the NAACP. Du Bois left academe to become the NAACP's director of research and publicity as well as editor of its influential magazine, The Crisis. From this bully pulpit, he battled for racial justice; conducted intellectual inquiries (among other matters, on the talented-tenth theory); critiqued the views of rivals like Booker T. Washington (``the great accommodator''); and otherwise played to the hilt the role of outside agitator (he was active in the Pan-African cause as well). Here, he's last seen after a post- WW I congress that called for direct League of Nations supervision of German colonies in Africa, as he himself returns to a society that brutally and methodically excluded ``his people from meaningful citizenship....'' A masterly appreciation of a great man's intellectual development and singular service in a righteous crusade.

In it is written the history&#x2014;and the fate&#x2014;of every human being. And he who owns it writes his own destiny. Now Indiana Jones follows a trail of danger, magic, and archaeological mystery through the war-torn Orient, from Rangoon to the Egyptian desert, searching for the secret underground hiding place of the all-powerful Omega Book. But with a beautiful woman seeking her missing magician husband, and a vengeance-crazed Japanese spymaster hot on his heels, Indy is running out of time. If the Omega Book falls into the wrong hands, not only his own fate but the fate of the world will be at the mercy of a madman bent on writing humanity&#x2019;s final chapter!</p><p>Max McCoy is an award-winning journalist and author whose novels include <i>The Sixth Rider </i>and <i>Sons of Fire</i>. He lives in Pittsburgh, Kansas.<p>1<br> The Tomb of Terror<br><br> Mount Hua, Shaanxi Province, China--1934<br><br> "The door," the villager croaked and rapped the side of the Sacred Mountain&nbsp;with his walking stick. "I leave now."<br> "No," Indiana Jones said as he batted dust from his fedora and struggled to catch his breath. The climb had been tougher than it had looked at dusk from the bottom of the mountain. Now half the night was gone and there was still much to be done. "The deal was to take me back down the mountain as well," Indy said as he placed his hands on his knees and leaned forward to ease the pain in his chest. "Or don't you think I'm coming back?"<br> The old villager smiled serenely.&nbsp;He hugged his walking stick and regarded the gasping American through milky eyes. Then he gave a lazy smile that revealed a mouthful of jagged teeth as he leaned forward.<br><br> "Jones pay Lo now," he said.<br><br> Indy gritted his teeth.<br><br> Looking at Lo's face from this distance reminded Indy of holding a pet rat and peering down its grinning snout--you didn't know when the rat was going to sink his teeth into your fingers, you just knew that eventually it would.<br> Lo was the best guide in the province, but he was the most notorious liar as well. When Indy first came to the village of Lintong, three days ago, Lo had bragged that he had been inside all of the important treasure tombs of the Wei Bei Plain. And although Lo could name the occupants of each of the tombs anddescribe in blood-curdling detail what horrors lurked in each, Indy knew it had been a long time since the villager had seen the interior of an unlooted grave, if indeed he ever had; otherwise, he wouldn't have found him living on top of a garbage mound, begging foreigners for money to buy opium.<br><br> "I don't see any door here," Indy said.<br><br> Indy took a rag from his back pocket and wiped the blood from his palms, injured from scrabbling for holds in the face of the mountain. His elbows and shins ached from several near-falls, and the muscles in his lower back quivered like rubber.<br><br> "Door there," Lo said. "Feel."<br><br> As Indy's fingertips touched the outlines of what did appear to be a doorway, his cuts and bruises were forgotten. His hands skittered over the granite&nbsp;like curious spiders, tracing a perfect circle about a yardstick in diameter as they followed the edges of the door, then moved inward. When his right hand came to a stone handle carved in the middle of the door, his fingers closed tightly around it.<br><br> He gave a tug.<br><br> It felt as solid as the mountain to which it was attached.<br><br> Lo giggled. The villager continued to chortle as he covered his mouth with his left hand, and eventually it became an insulting, lilting laugh.<br><br> "Told you," Lo said. "It cannot be opened. Some say it takes the right kind of magic, others say that the door is just picture carved into the mountain."<br><br> "What do you say?" Indy asked.<br><br> "I tell you when I get my money."<br><br> "All right," Indy said. As he counted out a fistful of bills of various countries and denominations from the pockets of his leather jacket, he asked Lo: "Why aren't you tired? I'm tired."<br><br> "Americans breathe too shallow, always out of air," Lo said and made an elaborate gesture with his hands of air flowing in&nbsp;and then out of his diaphragm. "Must breathe all the way to stomach and feed chi, the life force."<br><br> Indy shook his head.<br><br> "You're not so bad for an opium addict," he said as he thrust out the bills.<br><br> Lo snatched the colorful wad of money out of Indy's hand, counted it, then tucked it inside his sash. "Not always addict," Lo said. "Once best damn grave robber in mausoleum district. Then the Japanese come."<br><br> Lo spat.<br><br> "Now, no way for Lo to make honest living."<br><br> Since the Imperial Japanese Army had seized Manchuria, raiding parties had been crossing the border with some regularity and searching for plunder in the fabled mausoleum district. The district contained the tombs of eleven dynasties of Chinese royalty, and lay just north of the provincial capital of&nbsp;Xi'an--or Changan, as it was called in ancient times--the "City of Everlasting Peace" at the end of the Silk Road. Bristling over the plain like a dragon protecting her lair was the jagged outline of Mount Hua, the Sacred Mountain.<br><br> All of the easy tombs had long ago been plundered; for most, it was just a matter of digging into the conspicuous-looking mounds the locals called "lings." Still, Indy believed, there must be some that were beyond the reach of a shovel. Beneath the river, perhaps, or inside the&nbsp;mountain.<br><br> Indy was counting on the latter.<br><br> Besides, it wasn't all guesswork on Indy's part. He had been guided here by the inscription on the blade of a knife which said the Sacred Mountain was the tomb of Qin Shi&nbsp;Huang, first emperor of China. The knife had been given to Indy by a descendant of Genghis Khan during an expedition across the Gobi.<br><br> "The Japanese raiders will be back at first light, so we'd better work fast," Indy said. "Tell me about this door."<br> "Just picture carved into mountain," Lo said arrogantly. "Once, seventeen years ago, Lo and his cousins came to this spot and tied a thick rope around the handle. Then we put a log over boulder there, tied rope to end of it, and all pushed on end of log."<br><br> "What happened?"<br><br> "Rope broke," Lo said and turned to leave. "Good-bye."<br><br> "Not quite yet," Indy said as he smoothly placed the fedora on his head, then grabbed the villager's shoulder with the same hand.<br><br> "What else to do?" Lo asked.<br><br> "Research," Indy said as&nbsp;he took his notebook out of his satchel. He held the pencil in his mouth as he flipped to a page marked by a rubber band. There was a sketch of a round door, along with its dimensions, that Indy had copied from an ancient Arab manuscript. The manuscript&nbsp;was unrelated to the Qin treasure, but Indy had discovered that the architects of secret places thought alike, even if they were from different centuries and cultures. The tip-off for Indy was the last line of the inscription on the knife blade: The breath&nbsp;of the Sacred Mountain protects the tomb of Qin.<br><br> Indy now had a tape and was comparing the measurements of the door with those of the sketch. When he was satisfied, he took a piece of chalk from his satchel and, measuring carefully from a small indentation in the center of the handle, made an X on the right half of the door. Then he took a metal protractor, measured the angle from the edge of the tape, and made another X at the same distance, but forty-five degrees from the line of the first. Finally Indy&nbsp;measured the distance, halved it, and placed a larger X between the original marks.<br><br> "Qin, old man," Indy said. "X marks the spot."<br><br> "What kind of magic is this?" Lo asked.<br><br> "Geometry," Indy said as he replaced the chalk and notebook and removed a rock hammer and a chisel from the satchel. The chisel was tapered to a sharp, needlelike point.<br><br> "Now, I'm going to make some noise. It shouldn't take long, but it could attract some unwanted attention. Keep a sharp eye out."<br><br> Lo nodded.<br><br> Indy&nbsp;placed the tip of the chisel against the chalk mark, drew back the rock hammer, then struck the butt of the chisel hard enough that sparks flew.<br><br> Lo covered his ears against the clanging sound.<br><br> Indy continued to hammer, quicker and with more vigor, turning the chisel as he went. More sparks and bits of granite erupted from the point of the chisel.<br><br> He stopped after a dozen blows, blew away the rock dust, and inspected the depression he was making in the stone door. "Maybe I've got the wrong spot, but from&nbsp;the book I found in Cairo--" Indy gritted his teeth. "No, this is it. I haven't made a mistake."<br><br> Indy placed the chisel firmly against the spot, drew the hammer back, and struck. The chisel broke through--accompanied by a sound like a rifle shot--then disappeared from Indy's hand as it was snatched through the door by some unseen power.<br><br> Lo placed a hand to his mouth and stepped back.<br><br> There was a whistling sound as a torrent of night air was sucked in through the hole. Within seconds, the surface of the door around the hole was coated with a white layer of frost that was quickly turning to ice.<br><br> "Black magic," Lo stuttered.<br><br> "Not quite," Indy said when the rush of air had subsided. Indy grasped the handle and pulled. The round door, which fit like a tapered cork into the pipelike tunnel behind it, began to come forward. Lo rushed to help Indy with the door, and soon the three-hundred-pound cork was resting between them.<br><br> "But how?" Lo asked.<br><br> "Vacuum," Indy said. "The tomb had been sealed with a partial vacuum. Just a slight difference in air pressure makes locks and chains unnecessary. You found out that a team of horses couldn't have pulled that door away. But break the seal and equalize the pressure, and it becomes rather simple."<br><br> Lo nodded.<br><br> "The chisel&nbsp;broke through the mortared-over holes where the tomb builders stuck their hoses to pump the air out," Indy said as he brought out a battery-powered light. He strapped the lamp and reflector over his fedora and clipped the battery pack to his belt. To keep&nbsp;the power cord out of his face, he ran it through a belt loop over his back pocket before plugging it in.<br><br> "What Jones think is inside?" Lo asked, his eyes gleaming. "The stories I have heard since childhood--mountains of gold, rivers of silver, a skyful&nbsp;of jewels."<br><br> "I intend to find out," Indy said as he climbed into the tunnel.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br><br></p></p><h2>The Trip to Echo Spring: On Writers and Drinking</h2><p><p>WHY IS IT THAT SOME OF THE GREATEST WORKS OF LITERATURE HAVE BEEN PRODUCED BY WRITERS IN THE GRIP OF ALCOHOLISM, AN ADDICTION THAT COST THEM PERSONAL HAPPINESS AND CAUSED HARM TO THOSE WHO LOVED THEM?</p><p>In <i>The Trip to Echo Spring</i>, Olivia Laing examines the link between creativity and alcohol through the work and lives of six extraordinary men: F.

It&#x2019;s winter, the kind of cold that hurts bones and lungs, that reddens knuckles, makes noses run. If you could, by some devoted act of seeing, crane in through the window as they rattle by, you&#x2019;d see the older man, the one in the passenger seat, has forgotten to put on his socks. He&#x2019;s wearing penny loafers on bare feet, oblivious to the cold, like a prep school boy on a summer jaunt. In fact you could mistake him for a boy: slight, in Brooks Brothers tweeds and flannel trousers, his hair immaculately combed. Only his face betrays him, collapsed into hangdog folds. <br>The other man is bigger, burlier, thirty-five. Sideburns, bad teeth, a ragged sweater open at the elbow. It&#x2019;s not quite nine a.m. They turn off the highway and pull into the parking lot of the state liquor store. The clerk&#x2019;s out front, keys glinting in his hand. Seeing him, the man in the passenger seat yanks the door and lurches out, never mind the car&#x2019;s still moving. &#x2018;By the time I got inside the store,&#x2019; the other man will write, a long time later, &#x2018;he was already at the checkout stand with half a gallon of Scotch.&#x2019; <br>They drive away, passing the bottle back and forth. Within a few hours they&#x2019;ll be back at the University of Iowa, swaying eloquently in front of their respective classes. Both are, as if it isn&#x2019;t obvious, in deep trouble with alcohol. Both are also writers, one very well known, the other just cresting into success. <br>John Cheever, the older man, is the author of three novels, <i>The Wapshot Chronicle</i>, <i>The Wapshot Scandal</i> and <i>Bullet Park</i>, as well as some of the most miraculous and distinctive stories ever written. He&#x2019;s sixty-one. Back in May, he was rushed to hospital with dilated cardiomyopathy, testament to the almighty havoc alcohol wreaks upon the heart. After three days in the Intensive Care Unit he developed delirium tremens, becoming so violently disturbed he had to be secured with a leather straitjacket. The job at Iowa &#x2013; a semester teaching at the famous Writers&#x2019; Workshop &#x2013; must have seemed like a passport to a better life, though it isn&#x2019;t quite panning out that way. For various reasons he&#x2019;s left his family behind, living like a bachelor in a single room at the Iowa House Hotel. <br>Raymond Carver, the younger man, has also just joined the faculty. His room is identical to Cheever&#x2019;s, and immediately beneath it. The same painting hangs on both their walls. He&#x2019;s come alone too, leaving his wife and teenaged children in California. All his life he&#x2019;s wanted to be a writer, and all his life he&#x2019;s felt circumstance set hard against him. The drinking&#x2019;s been going on for a long while, but despite its depredations he&#x2019;s managed to produce two volumes of poetry and to build up quite a clutch of stories, many of them published in little magazines. <br>At first glance, the two men seem polar opposites. Cheever looks and sounds every inch the moneyed Wasp, though closer acquaintance reveals this to be a complex kind of subterfuge. Carver, on the other hand, is a millworker&#x2019;s son from Clatskanie, Oregon, who spent years supporting his writing with menial jobs as a janitor, a stockboy and a cleaner. <br>They met on the evening of 30 August 1973. Cheever knocked on the door of room 240, holding out a glass and announcing, according to Jon Jackson, a student who was present at the time: &#x2018;Pardon me. I&#x2019;m John Cheever. Could I borrow some Scotch?&#x2019; Carver, elated to meet one of his heroes, stutteringly held out a vast bottle of Smirnoff. Cheever accepted a slug, though he turned his nose up at the embellishments of ice or juice. <br>Sensing a dual intersection of interests, the two men immediately bonded. They spent much of their time together in the Mill bar, which only served beer, talking about literature and women. Twice a week they drove out in Carver&#x2019;s Falcon to the liquor store for Scotch, which they drank in Cheever&#x2019;s room. &#x2018;He and I did nothing <i>but</i> drink,&#x2019; Carver reported later, in the <i>Paris Review</i>. &#x2018;I mean, we met our classes in a manner of speaking, but the entire time we were there&nbsp;&#x2026; I don&#x2019;t think either of us ever took the covers off our typewriters.&#x2019; <br>What&#x2019;s odd about this wasteful year, not to mention all the disasters that followed on its heels, is that Cheever predicted it, in a manner of speaking. A decade earlier, he wrote a short story published in the <i>New Yorker</i> on 18 July 1964. &#x2018;The Swimmer&#x2019; is about alcohol and what it can do to a man; how conclusively it can wipe out a life. It begins with a characteristically Cheeverish line: &#x2018;It was one of those mid-summer Sundays when everyone sits around saying, &#x201c;I drank too much last night.&#x201d;&#x2019; <br>One of those people is Neddy Merrill, a slender, boyish man with an attractive air of vitality about him. Trotting out into the sunshine for a morning dip in his host&#x2019;s pool, he&#x2019;s struck by a delightful idea: that he will make his way home by way of a &#x2018;string of swimming pools, that quasi-subterranean stream that curved across the county&#x2019;. He names this secret road of mixed waters <i> Lucinda</i>, in honour of his wife. But there&#x2019;s another liquid path he also follows: a chain of drinks taken on neighbours&#x2019; terraces and yards, and it&#x2019;s this more perilous route that leads him downwards by degrees to the story&#x2019;s uncanny and tragic end. <br>High on his marvellous plan, Neddy swims through the gardens of the Grahams and the Hammers, the Lears, the Howlands, the Crosscups and the Bunkers. As he passes on his self-appointed way he&#x2019;s plied with gin by &#x2018;natives&#x2019; &#x2013; whose customs, he thinks to himself disingenuously, &#x2018;would have to be handled with diplomacy if he was ever going to reach his destination&#x2019;. The next house he reaches is deserted, and after he&#x2019;s crossed the pool he slips into the gazebo and pours himself a drink: his fourth, he calculates vaguely, or perhaps his fifth. A great citadel of cumulus has been building all day, and now the storm breaks, a quick paradiddle of rain in the oaks followed by the pleasurable smell of cordite. <br>Neddy likes storms, but something about this downpour changes the tenor of his day. Sheltering in the gazebo, he notices a Japanese lantern that Mrs. Levy bought in Kyoto &#x2018;the year before last, or was it the year before that?&#x2019; Anyone can lose their footing in time, can misstep a beat or two of chronology. But then there&#x2019;s another queer flicker in temporality. The rain has stripped the maple, and the red and yellow leaves lie scattered on the grass. It&#x2019;s midsummer, Neddy thinks robustly, and so the tree must simply be blighted, but this sign of autumn gives him an unpleasant shot of melancholy. <br>The sense of foreclosure deepens. At the Lindleys, the jumping ring is overgrown and the horses seem to have been sold. Worse, the Welchers&#x2019; pool has been drained. The Lucinda, that magical, abundant river, has run dry. Neddy is staggered, and begins seriously to doubt his command of time. &#x2018;Was his memory failing or had he so disciplined it in the repression of unpleasant facts that he had damaged his sense of the truth?&#x2019; He pulls himself together though, rallying enough to cross Route 424, a portage more effortful and exposing than he&#x2019;d expected. <br>Next he braves the public baths, with their whistles and murkish water. No pleasure there, but he&#x2019;s soon up and out, clambering through the woods of the Halloran estate towards the dark, dazzled gold of their springfed pool. But here comes another offbeat, a sense that the world Neddy is travelling through is somehow strange to him, or he to it. Mrs. Halloran asks solicitously about his poor children, muttering something too about the loss of his house. Then, as he walks away, Neddy notices his shorts are hanging around his waist. Is it possible, he wonders, that he&#x2019;s lost weight over the course of a single afternoon? Time is slopping around like gin in a glass. It&#x2019;s still emphatically the same day, but now the warmth of midsummer has dissipated and the smell of wood smoke is articulate in the air. <br>From the Hallorans Neddy travels to their daughter&#x2019;s house, hoping to beg a glass of whiskey. Helen greets him warmly enough, but her house is dry and has been for three years. Bewildered, chilled to the bone, he heaves his way across the pool and cuts through the fields to the Biswangers. From the roar of voices it&#x2019;s evident a party is in full swing. He wanders in, still almost naked. But now, mysteriously, it&#x2019;s twilight, and the water on the pool has &#x2018;a wintry gleam&#x2019;. Mrs. Biswanger, who has angled for Neddy as a guest for years, has apparently suffered some change of heart. She greets him rudely, and when his back is turned can be heard saying: &#x2018;They went for broke overnight &#x2013; nothing but income &#x2013; and he showed up drunk one Sunday and asked us to loan him five thousand dollars.&#x2019; Then the bartender rebuffs him, confirming his sneaking sense that some social loss of grace has occurred, and been remembered and recorded. <br>Struggling on, he passes next through the garden of a former mistress, though he can&#x2019;t remember precisely when or in what mood he broke it off. She isn&#x2019;t wholly pleased to see him either, and is likewise fretful about the possibility that he wants money. Leaving, he catches on the cooling air an autumnal smell, not quite placeable but &#x2018;strong as gas&#x2019;. Marigolds? Chrysanthemums? Looking up, he sees the winter constellations have taken up their stations in the night sky. Flooded with uncertainty, he begins, for the first time in his life, to cry. <br>There are only two more pools to go. He flails and gasps through the final laps before walking in damp trunks up the drive to his own house. But now the hints about a downturn in his fortunes begin to clarify, for the lights are out, the doors are locked, the rooms are empty and nobody, it is clear, has lived here for a long while. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>&#x2018;The Swimmer&#x2019; had come into my mind because I was plummeting through the sky above New York, where the land breaks apart in a clutter of islands and marshes. There are some subjects one can&#x2019;t address at home, and so at the beginning of the year I&#x2019;d left England for America, a country almost entirely unknown to me. I wanted time to think, and what I wanted to think about was alcohol. I&#x2019;d spent the winter upcountry, in a cottage in New Hampshire, and now it was spring and I was moving south. <br>Last time I&#x2019;d passed over here the earth was white all the way up to the Arctic, and the Connecticut River turned through dark bars of forest frozen the metallic blue-grey of the barrel of a gun. Now the ice had melted, and the whole landscape was ablaze. It reminded me of Cheever&#x2019;s line &#x2013; that to live &#x2018;in a world so generously supplied with water seemed like a clemency, a beneficence&#x2019;. <br>&#x2018;The Swimmer&#x2019;, which I would judge among the finest stories ever written, catches in its strange compressions the full arc of an alcoholic&#x2019;s life and it was that same dark trajectory I wanted to pursue. I wanted to know what made a person drink and what it did to them. More specifically I wanted to know why writers drink, and what effect this stew of spirits has had upon the body of literature itself. <br>John Cheever and Raymond Carver are hardly the only writers whose lives were made desolate by alcohol. Alongside them come Ernest Hemingway, William Faulkner, Tennessee Williams, Jean Rhys, Patricia Highsmith, Truman Capote, Dylan Thomas, Marguerite Duras, Hart Crane, John Berryman, Jack London, Elizabeth Bishop, Raymond Chandler &#x2013; the list staggers on. As Lewis Hyde observes in his essay &#x2018;Alcohol and Poetry&#x2019;, &#x2018;four of the six Americans who have won the Nobel Prize for literature were alcoholic. About half of our alcoholic writers eventually killed themselves.&#x2019; <br>Alcoholism is not a simple condition to define. According to the American Society of Addiction Medicine, its essential features are &#x2018;impaired control over drinking, preoccupation with the drug alcohol, use of alcohol despite adverse consequences, and distortions in thinking, most notably denial&#x2019;. In 1980, <i>The</i> <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</i> dropped the term &#x2018;alcoholism&#x2019; entirely, replacing it with two interrelated disorders: alcohol abuse (defined as &#x2018;repeated use despite recurrent adverse consequences&#x2019;) and alcohol dependence (defined as &#x2018; <i>alcohol abuse</i> combined with tolerance, withdrawal and an uncontrollable drive to drink&#x2019;). <br>As to what causes it, the jury remains out. In fact, under the heading &#x2018;Etiology&#x2019;, my old 1992 <i>Merck Manual</i> announces baldly: &#x2018;The cause of alcoholism is unknown.&#x2019; In the intervening years there have been thousands of research programmes and academic studies, and yet the consensus remains that alcoholism is caused by some mysterious constellation of factors, among them personality traits, early life experiences, societal influences, genetic predisposition and abnormal chemistry of the brain. Listing these possible causes, the current edition of the <i>Merck Manual</i> concludes, a little dispiritedly: &#x2018;However, such generalizations should not obscure the fact that alcohol use disorders can occur in anyone, regardless of their age, sex, background, ethnicity, or social situation.&#x2019; <br>Unsurprisingly, the theories writers tend to offer lean more towards the symbolic than the sociological or scientific. Discussing Poe, Baudelaire once commented that alcohol had become a weapon &#x2018;to kill something inside himself, a worm that would not die&#x2019;. In his introduction to <i>Recovery</i>, the posthumously published novel of the poet John Berryman, Saul Bellow observed: &#x2018;Inspiration contained a death threat. He would, as he wrote the things he had waited and prayed for, fall apart. Drink was a stabiliser. It somewhat reduced the fatal intensity.&#x2019; <br>There&#x2019;s something about these answers and the mixed motives they reveal that seems to catch at a deeper and more resonant aspect of alcohol addiction than the socio-genetic explanations that are in currency today. It was for this reason that I wanted to look at <i>writers</i> who drank, though God knows there&#x2019;s barely a section of our society that&#x2019;s immune to alcohol&#x2019;s lures. After all, it&#x2019;s they who, by their very nature, describe the affliction best. Often they&#x2019;ve written about their experiences or those of their contemporaries, either transposed into fiction, or in the letters, memoirs and diaries they&#x2019;ve used to mythologise or interrogate their lives. <br>As I began to read through these rafts of papers, I realised something else. These men and women were connected, both physically and by a series of repeating patterns. They were each other&#x2019;s friends and allies, each other&#x2019;s mentors, students and inspirations. In addition to Raymond Carver and John Cheever in Iowa, there were other drinking partnerships, other vexed allegiances. Hemingway and Fitzgerald tippled together in the caf�s of 1920s Paris, while the poet John Berryman was the first person at Dylan Thomas&#x2019;s bedside when he died. <br>Then there were the echoes. I&#x2019;d grown most interested in six male writers, whose experiences seemed to dovetail and mirror each other. (There were many women writers I could have chosen too, but for reasons that will become apparent their stories came too close to home.) Most of this six had &#x2013; or saw themselves as having &#x2013; that most Freudian of pairings, an overbearing mother and a weak father. All were tormented by self-hatred and a sense of inadequacy. Three were profoundly promiscuous, and almost all experienced conflict and dissatisfaction with regard to their sexuality. Most died in middle age, and the deaths that weren&#x2019;t suicides tended to be directly related to the years of hard and hectic living. At times, all tried in varying degrees to give up alcohol, but only...</p><h2>Robert Parker: Three Complete Spenser Novels (The Godwulf Manuscript / Mortal Stakes / Promised Land)</h2><p>A mystery fan&#39;s collection of three works by the best-selling Robert Parker features the wisecracking, pizza-and-beer-consuming detective Spenser in The Godwulf Manuscript, Mortal Stakes, and Promised Land.</p><p>A mystery fan&#39;s collection of three works by the best-selling Robert Parker features the wisecracking, pizza-and-beer-consuming detective Spenser in The Judas Goat, Looking for Rachel Wallace, and Early Autumn.</p><h2>Vegetables from Amaranth to Zucchini: The Essential Reference: 500 Recipes, 275 Photographs</h2><p><p><em>Vegetables from Amaranth to Zucchini: The Essential Reference</em> is at once an encyclopedia, a produce market manual, and a treasure trove of recipes.

Yet sometime near the end of the century, censors cut a section from <i>The Secret History of the Mongols,</i> leaving a single tantalizing quote from Genghis Khan: &#x201c;Let us reward our female offspring.&#x201d; Only this hint of a father&#x2019;s legacy for his daughters remained of a much larger story.&nbsp;<br><br>The queens of the Silk Route turned their father&#x2019;s conquests into the world&#x2019;s first truly international empire, fostering trade, education, and religion throughout their territories and creating an economic system that stretched from the Pacific to the Mediterranean. Outlandish stories of these powerful queens trickled out of the Empire, shocking the citizens of Europe and and the Islamic world.<br><br>After Genghis Khan&#x2019;s death in 1227, conflicts erupted between his daughters and his daughters-in-law; what began as a war between powerful women soon became a war against women in power as brother turned against sister, son against mother. At the end of this epic struggle, the dynasty of the Mongol queens had seemingly been extinguished forever, as even their names were erased from the historical record..&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> One of the most unusual and important warrior queens of history arose to avenge the wrongs, rescue the tattered shreds of the Mongol Empire, and restore order to a shattered world. Putting on her quiver and picking up her bow, Queen Mandhuhai led her soldiers through victory after victory. In her thirties she married a seventeen-year-old prince, and she bore eight children in the midst of a career spent fighting the Ming Dynasty of China on one side and a series of Muslim warlords on the other. Her unprecedented success on the battlefield provoked the Chinese into the most frantic and expensive phase of wall building in history. Charging into battle even while pregnant, she fought to reassemble the Mongol Nation of Genghis Khan and to preserve it for her own children to rule in peace.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> At the conclusion of his magnificently researched and ground-breaking narrative, Weatherford notes that, despite their mystery and the efforts to erase them from our collective memory, the deeds of these Mongol queens inspired great artists from Chaucer and Milton to Goethe and Puccini, and so their stories live on today. With <i>The Secret History of the Mongol Queens</i>, Jack Weatherford restores the queens&#x2019; missing chapter to the annals of history.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>JACK WEATHERFORD holds the DeWitt Wallace Chair of Anthropology at Macalester College in Minnesota and an honorary position at Chinggis Khaan University in Mongolia. In 2007 he received the Order of the Polar Star, the highest award for service to the Mongol Nation for writing <i>Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World.</i>, He is also the author of <i>Indian Givers</i>, <i>Native Roots</i>, <i>Savages and Civilizations</i>, and <i>The History of Money.</i>Though the prolific Genghis Khan fathered numerous sons and daughters, historians have dutifully recorded the foibles and follies of his male heirs while virtually ignoring the accomplishments of his female offspring. Weatherford seeks to remedy this glaring omission by providing a fascinating romp through the feminine side of the infamous Khan clan. Surprisingly, old Genghis himself seems to have been impressed enough by the leadership abilities of his womenfolk to want to reward some of them with pieces of his vast empire. At least four of his daughters became queens of their own countries, exercising power over their courts, their armies, and, of course, their families. Important linchpins in the Mongol Empire, these women supplied the balance of power necessary to appease fractious tribes and territories. Unfortunately, soon after Genghis Khan&#x2019;s death, the female rulers were challenged by their male relatives, and the fragile bonds that held the Mongol Empire together quickly disintegrated. Ironically, it wasn&#x2019;t until the emergence of a new queen, two centuries later, that the once-mighty Mongol nation was reunited. Let&#x2019;s hear it for the girls. --Margaret Flanagan</p><h2>Japanese Quilting Piece by Piece: 29 Stitched Projects from Yoko Saito</h2><p>From master quilt artist Yoko Saito, <i>Japanese Quilting Piece by Piece</i> explores traditional folk themes and interprets them with a vintage, yet modern feel.

Although the book opens with a scary scene--a family is stabbed to death by "a man named Jack&#x201d; --the story quickly moves into more child-friendly storytelling. The sole survivor of the attack--an 18-month-old baby--escapes his crib and his house, and toddles to a nearby graveyard. Quickly recognizing that the baby is orphaned, the graveyard's ghostly residents adopt him, name him Nobody ("Bod"), and allow him to live in their tomb. Taking inspiration from Kipling&#x2019;s <i>The Jungle Book</i>, Gaiman describes how the toddler navigates among the headstones, asking a lot of questions and picking up the tricks of the living and the dead. In serial-like episodes, the story follows Bod's progress as he grows from baby to teen, learning life&#x2019;s lessons amid a cadre of the long-dead, ghouls, witches, intermittent human interlopers. A pallid, nocturnal guardian named Silas ensures that Bod receives food, books, and anything else he might need from the human world.

One Spirit Main.</p><p>From the author of <i>Simple Abundance: A Daybook of Comfort and Joy</i> comes a guided excavation for women who suspect that there's something more to life than the top layer pursuits of money, sex, and love. In service to these restless souls who want to scratch beneath the surface, Ban Breathnach offers tidbit-sized essays that help women unearth pay dirt--their reason for being. Using archaeology as her frame of reference, Ban Breathnach suggests imaginative exercises at the end of each chapter, which she refers to as "Field Work." Although it occasionally feels overdone, the archaeology metaphor works well--helping readers unearth their past choices and circumstances to better understand the soul's current mission. Early in the book, Ban Breathnach offers this enticing invitation to go on a spiritual dig: "Besides the fact that your soul is one of the last unlooted sources of the miraculous, with discoveries as spectacular as any found in the Delta of Venus or Egypt's Valley of the Kings, you can embark on a soul trip and be back before anyone even notices you're missing. They might be curious about that gleam in your eye and that flush on your cheek, but I'll never tell if you won't. Are you game? We're heading to the sacred site of your soul." --<i>Gail Hudson</i>You may have a beautiful home, a family you adore, and work that you enjoy. But why do you secretly sense that you need something more to be truly happy? Because it's true. The wisdom, warmth, compassion, and disarming candor of Simple Abundance has made Sarah Ban Breathnach's a trusted voice to millions of women. Now Sarah invites you on a bold, brave, and beautiful continuation of the journey to authenticity, the search for...SOMETHING MORE. <p>In this eloquent and evocative book, Sarah Ban Breathnach encourages you to become an archaeologist of your Self: to plumb your past with its unfulfilled longings, forgotten pleasures, and abandoned dreams, to "excavate" the authentic woman buried inside. </p><p>Uncovering your authentic self will be challenging-but exhilarating. Assisting your personal "dig" will be hints and prompts from the lives of both celebrated and unknown women. These, in tandem with Sarah's own insights, will help you unravel your own mystery and recover the joy that has been missing from your life. Along the way, you will experience small but exquisite epiphanies that will help you come to terms with your past choices and reveal exciting new opportunities that lead to your destiny. </p><p>Dare to begin the journey. Within these pages lie powerful truths that can change your life...and inspire you to settle for nothing less than SOMETHING MORE.</p></p><h2>Sources and Contexts of the Book of Concord</h2><p>Born in controversy and raised in university settings, the Lutheran reform movement was embroiled immediately, publicly, and perennially in theological disputes and political battles. While controversies during Martin Luther&#39;s lifetime centered on disagreements with Rome and Geneva, present and later differences emerged over interpreting Luther&#39;s and Melanchthon&#39;s theologies on such issues as governmental interference, liturgical practices, justification&#39;s implications for good works and sin, the Lord&#39;s supper, and election. It is this defining dis-concord, alternating with attempts at concord and conciliation, that is reflected in the documents newly translated in this indispensable documentary companion to The Book of Concord, which includes the works of Agricola, Eck, Chemnitz, Melanchthon, and Luther.</p><p>Robert Kolb is Director of the Institute for Mission Studies, Concordia Seminary, St. Louis, and co-editor of the new translation of The Book of Concord (Fortress Press, 2000). <p>James A. Nestingen is Professor of Church History at Luther Seminary, St. Paul, Minn.</p>From the Foreword (pre-publication version): <p>While the Reformation movement led by Martin Luther was conceived in Wittenberg, in the midst of the university&#x2019;s enterprise of teaching and learning, the Lutheran church which it produced was born at Augsburg, through a public act of confessing the faith. This confessing took lasting form in a document. The Lutheran princes, municipal representatives, and theologians assembled at Augsburg in June 1530 directed their testimony of the biblical message toward church and world in the Augsburg Confession. This act of confessing was preserved as a written statement of faith, the birth certificate and charter of the Lutheran church. This confessional document addressed specific issues of concern to the Christian community in a series of articles intended to define the teaching of Scripture for the situation of that day. </p><p>Again in 1537, as they prepared for the council called by Pope Paul III, Lutheran theologians subscribed to a confession of faith composed by Luther, the Smalcald Articles. These articles also treated fundamental elements of biblical teaching under dispute within the specific context of the time. Forty years later Lutheran churches confessed their faith in the Formula of Concord, again with reference to twelve topics being debated within their own historical context. </p><p>In each of these cases sixteenth-century Lutherans defined their faith and their church by proclaiming and teaching the content of Scripture within the nexus of their own setting and circumstances. Implicit in this observation is the fact that, like all historical documents, the living confession and exposition of the Christian faith found in the Book of Concord can be better understood when the conditions and issues of the time are clearer. This clarity is in part obtainable by reading other documents from the period which shed light on the debates and concerns that moved the theologians of the period to address the questions posed for their church. Indeed, the documents in the Book of Concord are understandable as they were written, also for those who live in the very different circumstances of the turn of the twenty-first century. But their contents may be digested more thoroughly with the aid of information and insight regarding the debates and discussions of their own time. Such insights and information may be gained from contemporary documents. </p><p>This volume is intended to aid and support the study of the sixteenth century Lutheran confessions. It presents fourteen texts that help illumine the situations in which the authors of these confessions perceived themselves to be. Some of these documents have previously appeared in English translation, but in almost every case they are out of print. In this collection several documents are available which have not previously been at the disposal of English readers. To aid instructors and students in their study of the confessions, we also make suggestions in this preface for the use of other available translations of documents which can illumine the confessional texts. </p><p>The Documents in this Volume </p><p>Chronologically, Luther&#x2019;s catechisms were the first of what would later be called the Lutheran confessions to appear in print. . . . At the same time he was writing and preaching on the fundamentals of biblical learning during the 1520s, the reformer was urging other colleagues in Wittenberg and elsewhere to create a primer of the faith for families, teachers, and pastors to use in the instruction of young people. One of the early attempts, A Booklet for Laity and Children, appeared in 1525 [document #1]; it demonstrates how one person among Luther&#x2019;s disciples, under his influence, perceived the catechetical task to which the reformer addressed his own efforts in 1528 and 1529. Luther himself finally took the writing of the children&#x2019;s catechism (the Small Catechism) and the accompanying teacher&#x2019;s guide (his Large Catechism) in hand. He did so in part because others in his circle had not found time to produce these works which he considered most urgent, in part because one of his students had indeed produced his own catechisms. Johann Agricola, among the brightest and best of Luther&#x2019;s earliest students, prepared instructional materials for the pupils in the schools of Eisleben, where he was rector. These works reflected his antinomian views, which had brought him into sharp disagreement with the Wittenberg theologians, led by Philip Melanchthon and Martin Luther, at just this time. His One Hundred Thirty Questions for the Girl&#x2019;s School in Eisleben [document #2] also illustrates how those in the Wittenberg circle understood the task of catechizing the young; at the same time it reveals how Agricola&#x2019;s use of the law of God differs from that of Luther and Melanchthon. Luther&#x2019;s own catechism represents his attempt to counteract the influence of Agricola in the field of Christian education. </p><p>At the same time Luther felt compelled to devote his energies to meet the pressing needs for the instruction of the young, imperial politics was driving Lutheran governmental officials and theologians to explain their program for the reform of the church in doctrine and life. Emperor Charles V called an imperial diet for late spring 1530 in the city of Augsburg. There, he demanded, the Evangelical princes and cities of his empire were to justify their alterations in ecclesiastical practice. When the delegation of Elector John of Saxony arrived in Augsburg, a new publication by the leading Roman Catholic theologian in Germany, Johann Eck, greeted them. His Four Hundred Four Articles gathered citations from writings of the Wittenberg reformers and other authors who opposed the papal party into one malodorous potpourri of heresies, associating Luther, Melanchthon, and their colleagues with Anabaptist and Sacramentarian ideas of various sorts [document #3]. Some of the citations from the Wittenberg theologians themselves were taken out of context and given a heretical spin. The Lutherans, led by Melanchthon, recognized that they would have to make clear that the faith they confessed belonged solidly to the catholic tradition of the whole church.</p></p><h2>Competitive Advantage: Creating and Sustaining Superior Performance</h2><p>The essential complement to the pathbreaking book Competitive Strategy, Michael E. Porter&#39;s Competitive Advantage explores the underpinnings of competitive advantage in the individual firm. With over 30 printings in English and translated into thirteen languages, this second volume in Porter&#39;s landmark trilogy describes how a firm actually gains an advantage over its rivals. Competitive Advantage introduces a whole new way of understanding what a firm does. Porter&#39;s groundbreaking concept of the value chain disaggregates a company into &#34;activities,&#34; or the discrete functions or processes that represent the elemental building blocks of competitive advantage. Now an essential part of international business thinking, Competitive Advantage takes strategy from broad vision to an internally consistent configuration of activities. Its powerful framework provides the tools to understand the drivers of cost and a company&#39;s relative cost position. Porter&#39;s value chain enables managers to isolate the underlying sources of buyer value that will command a premium price, and the reasons why one product or service substitutes for another. He shows how competitive advantage lies not only in activities themselves but in the way activities relate to each other, to supplier activities, and to customer activities. Competitive Advantage also provides for the first time the tools to strategically segment an industry and rigorously assess the competitive logic of diversification. That the phrases &#34;competitive advantage&#34; and &#34;sustainable competitive advantage&#34; have become commonplace is testimony to the power of Porter&#39;s ideas. Competitive Advantage has guided countless companies, business school students, and scholars in understanding the roots of competition. Porter&#39;s work captures the extraordinary complexity of competition in a way that makes strategy both concrete and actionable.</p><p>Michael E. Porter, one of the world's leading authorities on competitive strategy and international competitiveness, is the C. Roland Christensen Professor of Business Administration at the Harvard Business School. In 1983, Professor Porter was appointed to President Reagan's Commission on Industrial Competitiveness, the initiative that triggered the competitiveness debate in America. He serves as an advisor to heads of state, governors, mayors, and CEOs throughout the world. The recipient of the Wells Prize in Economics, the Adam Smith Award, three McKinsey Awards, and honorary doctorates from the Stockholm School of Economics and six other universities, Porter is the author of fourteen books, among them <i>Competitive Strategy, The Competitive Advantage of Nations,</i> and <i>Cases in Competitive Strategy,</i> all published by The Free Press.

Competition determines the appropriateness of a firm's activities that can contribute to its performance, such as innovations, a cohesive culture, or good implementation. Competitive strategy is the search for a favorable competitive position in an industry, the fundamental arena in which competition occurs. Competitive strategy aims to establish a profitable and sustainable position against the forces that determine industry competition.<br><br>Two central questions underlie the choice of competitive strategy. The first is the attractiveness of industries for long-term profitability and the factors that determine it. Not all industries offer equal opportunities for sustained profitability, and the inherent profitability of its industry is one essential ingredient in determining the profitability of a firm. The second central question in competitive strategy is the determinants of relative competitive position within an industry. In most industries, some firms are much more profitable than others, regardless of what the average profitability of the industry may be.<br><br>Neither question is sufficient by itself to guide the choice of competitive strategy. A firm in a very attractive industry may still not earn attractive profits if it has chosen a poor competitive position. Conversely, a firm in an excellent competitive position may be in such a poor industry that it is not very profitable, and further efforts to enhance its position will be of little benefit. Both questions are dynamic; industry attractiveness and competitive position change. Industries become more or less attractive over time, and competitive position reflects an unending battle among competitors. Even long periods of stability can be abruptly ended by competitive moves.<br><br>Both industry attractiveness and competitive position can be shaped by a firm, and this is what makes the choice of competitive strategy both challenging and exciting. While industry attractiveness is partly a reflection of factors over which a firm has little influence, competitive strategy has considerable power to make an industry more or less attractive. At the same time, a firm can clearly improve or erode its position within an industry through its choice of strategy. Competitive strategy, then, not only responds to the environment but also attempts to shape that environment in a firm's favor.<br><br>These two central questions in competitive strategy have been at the core of my research. My book <i>Competitive Strategy: Techniques for Analyzing Industries and Competitors</i> presents an analytical framework for understanding industries and competitors, and formulating an overall competitive strategy. It describes the five competitive forces that determine the attractiveness of an industry and their underlying causes, as well as how these forces change over time and can be influenced through strategy. It identifies three broad generic strategies for achieving competitive advantage. It also shows how to analyze competitors and to predict and influence their behavior, and how to map competitors into strategic groups and assess the most attractive positions in an industry. It then goes on to apply the framework to a range of important types of industry environments that I term <i>structural settings,</i> including fragmented industries, emerging industries, industries undergoing a transition to maturity, declining industries, and global industries. Finally, the book examines the important strategic decisions that occur in the context of an industry, including vertical integration, capacity expansion, and entry.<br>par<br><br>This book takes the framework in <i>Competitive Strategy</i> as a starting point. The central theme of this book is how a firm can actually create and sustain a competitive advantage in its industry -- how it can implement the broad generic strategies. My aim is to build a bridge between strategy and implementation, rather than treat these two subjects independently or consider implementation scarcely at all as has been characteristic of much previous research in the field.<br><br>Competitive advantage grows fundamentally out of value a firm is able to create for its buyers that exceeds the firm's cost of creating it. Value is what buyers are willing to pay, and superior value stems from offering lower prices than competitors for equivalent benefits or providing unique benefits that more than offset a higher price. There are two basic types of competitive advantage: cost leadership and differentiation. This book describes how a firm can gain a cost advantage or how it can differentiate itself. It describes how the choice of competitive scope, or the range of a firm's activities, can play a powerful role in determining competitive advantage. Finally, it translates these concepts, combined with those in my earlier book, into overall implications for offensive and defensive competitive strategy, including the role of uncertainty in influencing strategic choices. This book considers not only competitive strategy in an individual industry but also corporate strategy for the diversified firm. Competitive advantage in one industry can be strongly enhanced by interrelationships with business units competing in related industries, if these interrelationships can actually be achieved. Interrelationships among business units are the principal means by which a diversified firm creates value, and thus provide the underpinnings for corporate strategy. I will describe how interrelationships among business units can be identified and translated into a corporate strategy, as well as how interrelationships can be achieved in practice despite the organizational impediments to doing so that are present in many diversified firms.<br><br>Though the emphases of this book and my earlier book are different, they are strongly complementary. The emphasis of <i>Competitive Strategy</i> is on industry structure and competitor analysis in a variety of industry environments, though it contains many implications for competitive advantage. This book begins by assuming an understanding of industry structure and competitor behavior, and is preoccupied with how to translate that understanding into a competitive advantage. Actions to create competitive advantage often have important consequences for industry structure and competitive reaction, however, and thus I will return to these subjects frequently.<br><br>This book can be read independently of <i>Competitive Strategy,</i> but its power to aid practitioners in formulating strategy is diminished if the reader is not familiar with the core concepts presented in the earlier book. In this chapter, I will describe and elaborate on some of those concepts. The discussion of the core concepts will also provide a good means of introducing the concepts and techniques in this book. In the process, I will address some of the most important questions that arise in applying the core concepts in practice. Thus even readers familiar with my earlier book may find the review of interest.<br><br><b>The Structural Analysis of Industries</b><br><br>The first fundamental determinant of a firm's profitability is industry attractiveness. Competitive strategy must grow out of a sophisticated understanding of the rules of competition that determine an industry's attractiveness. The ultimate aim of competitive strategy is to cope with and, ideally, to change those rules in the firm's favor. In any industry, whether it is domestic or international or produces a product or a service, the rules of competition are embodied in five competitive forces: the entry of new competitors, the threat of substitutes, the bargaining power of buyers, the bargaining power of suppliers, and the rivalry among the existing competitors.<br><br>The collective strength of these five competitive forces determines the ability of firms in an industry to earn, on average, rates of return on investment in excess of the cost of capital. The strength of the five forces varies from industry to industry, and can change as an industry evolves. The result is that all industries are not alike from the standpoint of inherent profitability. In industries where the five forces are favorable, such as pharmaceuticals, soft drinks, and data base publishing, many competitors earn attractive returns. But in industries where pressure from one or more of the forces is intense, such as rubber, steel, and video games, few firms command attractive returns despite the best efforts of management. Industry profitability is not a function of what the product looks like or whether it embodies high or low technology, but of industry structure. Some very mundane industries such as postage meters and grain trading are extremely profitable, while some more glamorous, high-technology industries such as personal computers and cable television are not profitable for many participants.<br><br>The five forces determine industry profitability because they influence the prices, costs, and required investment of firms in an industry -- the elements of return on investment. Buyer power influences the prices that firms can charge, for example, as does the threat of substitution. The power of buyers can also influence cost and investment, because powerful buyers demand costly service. The bargaining power of suppliers determines the costs of raw materials and other inputs. The intensity of rivalry influences prices as well as the costs of competing in areas such as plant, product development, advertising, and sales force. The threat of entry places a limit on prices, and shapes the investment required to deter entrants.<br><br>The strength of each of the five competitive forces is a function of <i>industry structure,</i> or the underlying economic and technical characteristics of an industry. Industry structure is relatively stable, but can change over time as an industry evolves. Structural change shifts the overall and relative strength of the competitive forces, and can thus positively or negatively influence industry profitability. The industry trends that are the most important for strategy are those that affect industry structure.<br><br>If the five competitive forces and their structural determinants were solely a function of intrinsic industry characteristics, then competitive strategy would rest heavily on picking the right industry and understanding the five forces better than competitors. But while these are surely important tasks for any firm, and are the essence of competitive strategy in some industries, a firm is usually not a prisoner of its industry's structure. Firms, through their strategies, can influence the five forces. If a firm can shape structure, it can fundamentally change an industry's attractiveness for better or for worse. Many successful strategies have shifted the rules of competition in this way.<br><br>In any particular industry, not all of the five forces will be equally important and the particular structural factors that are important will differ. Every industry is unique and has its own unique structure. The five-forces framework allows a firm to see through the complexity and pinpoint those factors that are critical to competition in its industry, as well as to identify those strategic innovations that would most improve the industry's -- and its own -- profitability. The five-forces framework does not eliminate the need for creativity in finding new ways of competing in an industry. Instead, it directs managers' creative energies toward those aspects of industry structure that are most important to long-run profitability. The framework aims, in the process, to raise the odds of discovering a desirable strategic innovation.<br><br>Strategies that change industry structure can be a double-edged sword, because a firm can destroy industry structure and profitability as readily as it can improve it. A new product design that undercuts entry barriers or increases the volatility of rivalry, for example, may undermine the long-run profitability of an industry, though the initiator may enjoy higher profits temporarily. Or a sustained period of price cutting can undermine differentiation. In the tobacco industry, for example, generic cigarettes are a potentially serious threat to industry structure. Generics may enhance the price sensitivity of buyers, trigger price competition, and erode the high advertising barriers that have kept out new entrants. Joint ventures entered into by major aluminum producers to spread risk and lower capital cost may have similarly undermined industry structure. The majors invited a number of potentially dangerous new competitors into the industry and helped them overcome the significant entry barriers to doing so. Joint ventures also can raise exit barriers because all the participants in a plant must agree before it can be closed down.<br><br>Often firms make strategic choices without considering the long-term consequences for industry structure. They see a gain in their competitive position if a move is successful, but they fail to anticipate the consequences of competitive reaction. If imitation of a move by major competitors has the effect of wrecking industry structure, then everyone is worse off. Such industry "destroyers" are usually second-tier firms that are searching for ways to overcome major competitive disadvantages, firms that have encountered serious problems and are desperately seeking solutions, or "dumb" competitors that do not know their costs or have unrealistic assumptions about the future. In the tobacco industry, for example, the Liggett Group (a distant follower) has encouraged the trend toward generics.<br><br>The ability of firms to shape industry structure places a particular burden on industry leaders. Leaders' actions can have a disproportionate impact on structure, because of their size and influence over buyers, suppliers, and other competitors. At the same time, leaders' large market shares guarantee that anything that changes overall industry structure will affect them as well. A leader, then, must constantly balance its own competitive position against the health of the industry as a whole. Often leaders are better off taking actions to improve or protect industry structure rather than seeking greater competitive advantage for themselves. Such industry leaders as Coca-Cola and Campbell's Soup appear to have followed this principle.<br><br><b>Industry Structure and Buyer Needs</b><br><br>It has often been said that satisfying buyer needs is at the core of success in business endeavor. How does this relate to the concept of industry structural analysis? Satisfying buyer needs is indeed a prerequisite to the viability of an industry and the firms within it. Buyers must be willing to pay a price for a product that exceeds its cost of production, or an industry will not survive in the long run. Chapter 4 will describe in detail how a firm can differentiate itself by satisfying buyer needs better than its competitors.<br><br>Satisfying buyer needs may be a prerequisite for industry profitability, but in itself is not sufficient. The crucial question in determining profitability is whether firms can capture the value they create for buyers, or whether this value is competed away to others. Industry structure determines who captures the value. The threat of entry determines the likelihood that new firms will enter an industry and compete away the value, either passing it on to buyers in the form of lower prices or dissipating it by raising the costs of competing. The power of buyers determines the extent to which they retain most of the value created for themselves, leaving firms in an industry only modest returns. The threat of substitutes determines the extent to which some other prod...</p><h2>Inside the Criminal Mind</h2><p>Long-held myths defining the sources of and cures for crime are shattered in this ground-breaking book--and a chilling profile of today&#39;s criminal emerges.</p><p>STANTON E. SAMENOW, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist, has spent thirty-four years as a researcher, clinician, consultant, and expert witness specializing in criminal behavior. He has also served as an independent evaluator in adversarial child custody disputes for the past twenty years and has been appointed to three presidential task forces on law enforcement, victims&#39; rights, and a drug-free America. In October 2003, he was appointed an expert witness for the prosecution in the trial against accused &#34;Washington Sniper&#34; Lee Boyd Malvo, aka John Lee Malvo. Dr. Samenow lives in Virginia.The Basic Myths About Criminals<br>IN NEARLY A HALF-CENTURY, little has changed in terms of deeply ingrained beliefs about the causes of crime. In the classic, still often performed, 1957 musical West Side Story, Stephen Sondheim parodied what then was the current thinking about juvenile delinquency in the song "Gee, Officer Krupke." Delinquents were punks because their fathers were drunks. They were misunderstood rather than no good. They were suffering from a "social disease," and society "had played [them] a terrible trick." They needed an analyst, not a judge, because it was "just [their] neurosis" acting up. In short, their criminal behavior was regarded as symptomatic of a deep-seated psychological or sociological problem. In this chapter I shall briefly discuss this proposition. In subsequent chapters I shall examine them in greater detail and show that the prevalent thinking about crime has been and still is loaded with fundamental misconceptions resulting in devastating consequences for society.<br><br>A man abducts, rapes, and murders a little girl. We, the public, may be so revolted by the gruesomeness of the crime that we conclude only a sick person could be capable of such an act. But our personal gut reaction shows no insight into, or understanding of, what really went on in this individual's mind as he planned and executed the crime. True, what the perpetrator inflicted upon this child is not "normal" behavior. But what does "sick" really mean? A detailed and lengthy examination of the mind of a criminal will reveal that, no matter how bizarre or repugnant the crime, he is rational, calculating, and deliberate in his actions--not mentally ill.<br><br>Criminals know right from wrong. In fact, some know the laws better than their lawyers do. But they believe that whatever they want to do at any given time is right for them. Their crimes require logic and self-control.<br><br>Some crimes happen so fast and with such frequency that they appear to be compulsive. A person may steal so often that others become convinced that he is the victim of an irresistible impulse and therefore a "kleptomaniac." But a thorough mental examination would show that he is simply a habitual thief, skilled at what he does. He can case out a situation with a glance, then quickly make off with whatever he wants. A habit is not a compulsion. On any occasion, the thief can refrain from stealing if he is in imminent danger of getting caught. And if he decides to give up stealing for a while and lie low, he will succeed in doing so.<br><br>The sudden and violent crime of passion has been considered a case of temporary insanity because the perpetrator acts totally out of character. But again, appearance belies reality.<br><br>A man murders his wife in the heat of an argument. He has not murdered anyone before, and statistical trends would project that he will not murder again. It is true that the date, time, and place of the homicide were not planned. But an examination of this man would show that on several occasions he had shoved her and often wished her dead. In addition, he is a person who frequently has fantasies of evening the score violently whenever he believes that anyone has crossed him. He did not act totally out of character when he murdered his wife. He was not seized by an alien, uncontrollable impulse. In his thinking, there was precedent for such a crime. An individual with even worse problems, but with a different personality makeup, would have resolved them differently. For example, one man whose family I evaluated during a child custody dispute discovered that his wife was spending hours on the Internet involved with a man whom she met and had sex with, then announced her plan to spend the rest of her life with him. Although her husband was emotionally devastated and irate, he neither threatened nor attacked her. He proceeded through the legal system toward divorce and obtaining custody of his daughter.<br><br>If criminals are not mentally ill, aren't they nevertheless victims of poverty, divorce, racism, and a society that denies them opportunities? Since the late nineteenth century, there has been a prevalent opinion that society is more to blame for crime than the criminal. But criminality is not limited to any particular societal group, as the 3.2 million arrests during 1999 demonstrate.<br><br>Sociologists assert that the inner-city youngster responds with rage to a society that has excluded him from the mainstream and put the American dream beyond his reach. Some even contend that crime is a normal and adaptive response to growing up in the soul-searing conditions of places like Watts and the South Bronx. They observe that correctional institutions contain a disproportionately large number of inmates who are poor and from minority groups. These inmates are seen as casualties of a society that has robbed them of hope and virtually forced them into crime just so they can survive.<br><br>Suburban delinquents are also regarded as victims--of intense pressures to compete, of materialism, of parents who neglect them or push them to grow up too fast, or are overly protective. These adolescents are perceived as rebelling not only against their parents but against middle-class values, seeking meaning instead through kicks and thrills.<br><br>If it isn't grinding poverty that causes crime, then its opposite--overindulgence--is cited as the cause. As developing nations become increasingly industrialized and their citizens become prosperous, crimes that were rare burst into headlines. In a Bangkok Post article about two tragic shooting sprees, the writer conjectured that "Western-style teenage crime" was emerging in Thailand because Thai children were so indulged that they would "snap" when confronted by life's hardships. Whether a child is deprived or pampered tells us nothing about how he will turn out. Most children who grow up in poverty and most indulged children become independent, resourceful, and responsible.<br><br>What of the observation that a disproportionate number of people incarcerated for crimes are both poor and from minority groups? Does this make a commentary on those groups? Or does it prove that the criminal justice system is racist? To whatever extent inequities exist, they need to be corrected. During the past thirty-three years I have focused on individuals, not groups. While interviewing and evaluating members of various ethnic and racial groups, I have found that in nearly every case members of the offender's own family have been law-abiding. The critical factor in becoming a criminal justice statistic is not race or ethnicity; it is the character of the individual and the choices he makes. It is unwarranted and racist to assume that because a person is poor and black (or brown, red, or yellow) he is inadequate to cope responsibly with his environment and therefore can hardly help but become a criminal.<br><br>Peer pressure is seen as a critical factor in the lives of youngsters from all social classes who turn to crime. Experts point out that some subcultures reward being daring and tough, and not living by a work ethic. Kids learn about crime from one another; they are schooled in the streets and go along with the crowd in order to acquire self-esteem and a sense of belonging. The belief that crime is contagious like a disease is more than a century old.<br><br>Every social institution has been blamed for contributing to crime. Schools have been singled out as forcing into crime youngsters who don't fit the academic mold. Churches have been accused of not providing leadership to wayward youth and to the community at large. Newspapers, television, and the movies have been charged with glamorizing crime. American business and advertising have been accused of contributing to distorted values and therefore to crime.<br><br>Economic hard times have been associated with an increase in crime. But then so have good times. Financial setbacks are said to push despondent people over the edge. But then, when times are booming, it has been thought that the gap between the "haves" and "have nots" widens and the latter, out of resentment, turn to crime. Economic pressures are also seen as contributing to crime by forcing mothers to go to work, further weakening the family. Their children have less supervision and guidance than before, and are even more vulnerable to peer pressure.<br><br>Economic adversity affects us all. We may be pushed to work longer hours or to take a second job. Women who prefer to be at home may have little choice but to go to work. Families may have to make do with less and watch goals slip further out of reach, and people on fixed incomes bear a special burden. The responsible person responds to economic pressures by sacrifice and hard work. Even for him, temptation may be stronger to step outside the law as the economic squeeze grows tighter. Ultimately, however, it comes down to how each person chooses to deal with the circumstances he faces.<br><br>Sociological explanations for crime, plausible as they may seem, are simplistic. If they were correct, we'd have far more criminals than we do. Criminals come from all kinds of families and neighborhoods. Most poor people are law-abiding, and most kids from divorced parents are not delinquents. Children may bear the scars of neglect and deprivation for life, but most do not become criminals. The environment does have some effect. For instance, it can provide greater or fewer opportunities for crime to occur--greater or lesser deterrence. But people perceive and react to similar conditions of life very differently. A family may reside in a neighborhood where gangs roam the streets and where drugs are as easy to come by as cigarettes. The father may have deserted and the mother may collect welfare. Yet not all the children in that family turn to crime. In suburbia, a family may be close emotionally and well off financially, but that is not enough to keep one of the youngsters from using drugs, stealing, and destroying property. In an area where firearm...</p><h2>Crabgrass Frontier: The Suburbanization of the United States</h2><p>In America, in contrast to almost anywhere else in the world, the good life means traveling a long distance to get to work. How and why this came to be our cultural norm is the subject of this long-awaited book.<br> Because more than two-thirds of all dwellings are single family homes surrounded by an ornamental yard, suburbia is the most distinctive physical characteristic of modern American society. <em>Crabgrass Frontier</em> is the first book to trace the growth of suburbs in America from their origins in the 1820's--in Brooklyn Heights opposite Manhattan--until the present day. Combining social history with economic and architectural history, the book discusses suburban communities in every section of the country as well as making comparisons with Europe and Japan.<br> Jackson considers such intriguing questions as why transportation technology changed the shape of American cities more than European ones, why the family room and the television set replaced the stoop and the street as the focus of social interaction, how the evolution of the garage reflected increasing affection for the automobile, how federal housing programs undermined inner city neighborhoods, and how government policies insured the collapse of the nation's once superb mass transit system. The book shows not only that Americans have long preferred a detached dwelling to a row house, rural life to city life, and owning to renting, but also that suburbanization has been as much a governmental as a natural process.<br> <em>About the Author</em>:<br> Kenneth T.

The #1 internationally bestselling author Jodi Picoult tells an unforgettable story about family secrets, love, and letting go.</i> <br><br>In the wild, when a wolf knows its time is over, when it knows it is of no more use to its pack, it may sometimes choose to slip away. Dying apart from its family, it stays proud and true to its nature. Humans aren&#x2019;t so lucky. <br><br>Luke Warren has spent his life researching wolves. He has written about them, studied their habits intensively, and even lived with them for extended periods of time. In many ways, Luke understands wolf dynamics better than those of his own family. His wife, Georgie, has left him, finally giving up on their lonely marriage. His son, Edward, twenty-four, fled six years ago, leaving behind a shattered relationship with his father. Edward understands that some things cannot be fixed, though memories of his domineering father still inflict pain. Then comes a frantic phone call: Luke has been gravely injured in a car accident with Edward&#x2019;s younger sister, Cara. <br><br>Suddenly everything changes: Edward must return home to face the father he walked out on at age eighteen. He and Cara have to decide their father&#x2019;s fate together. Though there&#x2019;s no easy answer, questions abound: What secrets have Edward and his sister kept from each other? What hidden motives inform their need to let their father die . . . or to try to keep him alive? What would Luke himself want? How can any family member make such a decision in the face of guilt, pain, or both? And most importantly, to what extent have they all forgotten what a wolf never forgets: that each member of a pack needs the others, and that sometimes survival means sacrifice? <br><br>Another tour de force by Picoult, <i>Lone Wolf </i>brilliantly describes the nature of a family: the love, protection, and strength it can offer&#x2014;and the price we might have to pay for those gifts. What happens when the hope that should sustain a family is the very thing tearing it apart?</p><p>Jodi Picoult received an AB in creative writing from Princeton and a master&#x2019;s degree in education from Harvard.

Or, more accurately, my clothes were once again hanging in my former bedroom, but I was living out of a backpack in a trailer on the north end of Redmond&#x2019;s Trading Post &amp; Dinosaur World. That&#x2019;s where my father&#x2019;s captive wolf packs were housed, along with gibbons, falcons, an overweight lion, and the animatronic T. rex that roared on the hour. Since that was where my father spent 99 percent of his time, it was expected that I follow.<br> <br>I thought this alternative beat living with my mom and Joe and the miracle twins, but it hadn&#x2019;t been the smooth transition I&#x2019;d hoped for. I guess I&#x2019;d pictured my dad and me making pancakes together on Sunday morning, or playing hearts, or taking walks in the woods. Well, my dad did take walks in the woods, but they were inside the pens he&#x2019;d built for his packs, and he was busy being a wolf. He&#x2019;d roll around in the mud with Sibo and Sobagw, the numbers wolves; he&#x2019;d steer clear of Pekeda, the beta of the pack. He&#x2019;d eat from the carcass of a calf with wolves on either side of him, his hands and his mouth bloody. My dad believed that infiltrating a pack was far more educational than observing from afar the way biologists did. By the time I moved in with him, he&#x2019;d already gotten five packs to accept him as a bona fide member&#x2014;worthy of living with, eating with, and hunting with them, in spite of the fact that he was human. Because of this, some people thought he was a genius. The rest thought he was insane.<br> <br>On the day I left my mom and her brand-spanking-new family, my dad was not exactly waiting for me with open arms. He was down in one of the enclosures with Mestawe, who was pregnant for the first time, and he was trying to forge a relationship with her so she&#x2019;d pick him as the nanny for the pups. He even slept there, with his wolf family, while I stayed up late and flicked through the TV channels. It was lonely in the trailer, but it was lonelier being landlocked at an empty house.<br> <br>In the summers, the White Mountains region was packed with visitors who went from Santa&#x2019;s Village to Story Land to Redmond&#x2019;s Trading Post. In March, though, that stupid T. rex roared to an empty theme park. The only people who stayed on in the off-season were my dad, who looked after his wolves, and Walter, a caretaker who covered for my dad when he wasn&#x2019;t on-site. It felt like a ghost town, so I started hanging out at the enclosures after school&#x2014;close enough that Bedagi, the tester wolf, would pace on the other side of the fence, getting used to my scent. I&#x2019;d watch my father dig a birthing bowl for Mestawe in her den, and meanwhile, I&#x2019;d tell him about the football captain who was caught cheating, or the oboe player in the school orchestra who had taken to wearing caftans, and was rumored to be pregnant.<br> <br>In return, my dad told me why he was worried about Mestawe: she was a young female, and instinct only went so far. She didn&#x2019;t have a role model who could teach her to be a good mother; she&#x2019;d never had a litter before. Sometimes, a wolf would abandon her pups simply because she didn&#x2019;t know better.<br> <br>The night Mestawe gave birth, she seemed to be doing everything by the book. My father celebrated by opening a bottle of champagne and letting me drink a glass. I wanted to see the babies, but my father said it would be weeks before they emerged. Even Mestawe would stay in the den for a full week, feeding the pups every two hours.<br> <br>Only two nights later, though, my father shook me awake. &#x201c;Cara,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;I need your help.&#x201d;<br> <br>I threw on my winter coat and boots and followed him to the enclosure where Mestawe was in her den. Except, she wasn&#x2019;t. She was wandering around, as far from her babies as she could get. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve tried everything to get her back inside, but she won&#x2019;t go,&#x201d; my father said matter-of-factly. &#x201c;If we don&#x2019;t save the pups now, we won&#x2019;t have a second chance.&#x201d;<br> <br>He burrowed into the den and came out holding two tiny, wrinkled rats. At least that&#x2019;s what they looked like, eyes squinched shut, wriggling in his hand. He passed these over to me; I tucked them inside my coat as he pulled out the last two pups. One looked worse off than the other three. It wasn&#x2019;t moving; instead of grunting, it let out tiny puffs every now and then.<br> <br>I followed my dad to a toolshed that stood behind the trailer. While I was sleeping he&#x2019;d tossed all the tools into the snow; now the floor inside was covered with hay. A blanket I recognized from the trailer&#x2014;a fluffy red plaid&#x2014;was inside a small cardboard box. &#x201c;Tuck them in,&#x201d; my father instructed, and I did. A hot water bottle underneath the blanket made it feel warm like a belly; three of the babies immediately began to snuffle between the folds. The fourth pup was cold to the touch. Instead of putting her beside her brothers, I slipped her into my coat again, against my heart.<br> <br>When my father returned, he was holding baby bottles full of Esbilac, which is like formula, but for animals. He reached for the little wolf in my arms, but I couldn&#x2019;t let her go. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll feed the others,&#x201d; he told me, and while I coaxed mine to drink a drop at a time, his three sucked down every last bottle.<br> <br>Every two hours, we fed the babies. The next morning, I didn&#x2019;t get dressed for school and my father didn&#x2019;t act like he expected me to. It was an unspoken truth: what we were doing here was far more important than anything I could learn in a classroom.<br> <br>On the third day, we named them. My father believed in using indigenous names for indigenous creatures, so all his wolf names came from the Abenaki language. Nodah, which meant Hear me, was the name we gave the biggest of the bunch, a noisy black ball of energy. Kina, or Look here, was the troublemaker who got tangled in shoelaces or stuck under the flaps of the cardboard box. And Kita, or Listen, hung back and watched us, his eyes never missing a thing.<br> <br>Their little sister I named Miguen, Feather. There were times she&#x2019;d drink as well as her brothers and I would believe she was out of the woods, but then she&#x2019;d go limp in my grasp and I&#x2019;d have to rub her and slip her inside my shirt to keep her warm again.<br> <br>I was so tired from staying up round the clock that I couldn&#x2019;t see straight. I sometimes slept on my feet, dozing for a few minutes before I snapped awake again. The whole time, I carried Miguen, until my arms felt empty without her in them. On the fourth night, when I opened my eyes after nodding off, my father was staring at me with an expression I&#x2019;d never seen before on his face. &#x201c;When you were born,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t let go of you, either.&#x201d;<br> <br>Two hours later, Miguen started shaking uncontrollably. I begged my father to drive to a vet, to the hospital, to someone who could help. I cried so hard that he bundled the other pups into a box and carried them out to the battered truck he drove. The box sat between us in the front seat and Miguen shivered beneath my coat. I was shaking, too, although I&#x2019;m not sure whether I was cold, or just afraid of what I knew was coming.<br> <br>She was gone by the time we got to the parking lot of the vet&#x2019;s office. I knew the minute it happened; she grew lighter in my arms. Like a shell.<br> <br>I started to scream. I couldn&#x2019;t stand the thought of Miguen, dead, being this close to me.<br> <br>My father took her away and wrapped her in his flannel shirt. He slipped the body into the backseat, where I wouldn&#x2019;t have to see her. &#x201c;In the wild,&#x201d; he told me, &#x201c;she never would have lasted a day. You&#x2019;re the only reason she stayed as long as she did.&#x201d;<br> <br>If that was supposed to make me feel better, it didn&#x2019;t. I burst into loud sobs.<br> <br>Suddenly the box with the wolf pups was on the dashboard, and I was in my father&#x2019;s arms. He smelled of spearmint and snow. For the first time in my life, I understood why he couldn&#x2019;t break free from the drug that was the wolf community. Compared to issues like this, of life and death, did it really matter if the dry cleaning was picked up, or if he forgot the date of open-school night?<br> <br>In the wild, my father told me, a mother wolf learns her lessons the hard way. But in captivity, where wolves are bred only once every three or four years, the rules are different. You can&#x2019;t stand by and just let a pup die. &#x201c;Nature knows what it wants,&#x201d; my father said. &#x201c;But that doesn&#x2019;t make it any easier for the rest of us, does it?&#x201d;<br> <br>There is a tree outside my father&#x2019;s trailer at Redmond&#x2019;s, a red maple. We planted it the summer after Miguen died, to mark the spot where she is buried. It&#x2019;s the same type of tree that, four years later, I see rushing toward the windshield too fast. The same type of tree our truck hits, in that instant, head-on.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <br>A woman is kneeling beside me. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s awake,&#x201d; the woman says. There&#x2019;s rain in my eyes and I smell smoke and I can&#x2019;t see my father.<br> <br>Dad? I say, but I can only hear it in my head.<br> <br>My heart&#x2019;s beating in the wrong place. I look down at my shoulder, where I can feel it.<br> <br>&#x201c;Looks like a scapula fracture and maybe some broken ribs. Cara? Are you Cara?&#x201d;<br> <br>How does she know my name?<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been in an accident,&#x201d; the woman tells me. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to take you to the hospital.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;My . . . father . . . ,&#x201d; I force out. Every word is a knife in my arm.<br> <br>I turn my head to try to find him and see the firemen, spraying a hose at the ball of flames that used to be my dad&#x2019;s truck. The rain on my face isn&#x2019;t rain, just mist from the stream of water.<br> <br>Suddenly I remember: the web of shattered windshield; the fishtail of the truck skidding; the smell of gasoline. The way when I cried for my dad he didn&#x2019;t answer. I start shaking all over.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re incredibly brave,&#x201d; the woman says to me. &#x201c;Dragging your father out of the car in your condition . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>I saw an interview once where a teenage girl lifted a refrigerator off her little cousin when it accidentally fell on him. It had something to do with adrenaline.<br> <br>A fireman who has been blocking my view moves and I can see another knot of EMTs gathered around my father, who lies very still on the ground.<br> <br>&#x201c;If it weren&#x2019;t for you,&#x201d; the woman adds, &#x201c;your dad might not be alive.&#x201d;<br> <br>Later, I will wonder if that comment is the reason I did everything I did. But right now, I just start to cry. Because I know her words couldn&#x2019;t be farther from the truth.</p><h2>The Secret (Animorphs #9)</h2><p>As the Yeerks close in on their hideout, the Animorphs realize that they have no choice but to fight, and Cassie plans to outsmart the enemy with the help of a cool but smelly new morph.

That was what Mr B. said, as he folded his newspaper and set it aside. What with the War in Spain, and the press of so many able fellows into the Navy; there was, simply put, a dearth of men.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>A dearth of men?</i> Lydia repeated the phrase, anxiously searching her sisters&#x2019; faces: was this indeed the case? <i>Was England running out of men?</i> <br> &nbsp;<br> Her father raised his eyes to heaven; Sarah, meanwhile, made big astonished eyes at Mrs Hill: a new servant joining the household! A <i>man</i>servant! Why hadn&#x2019;t she mentioned it before? Mrs Hill, clutching the coffee pot to her bosom, made big eyes back, and shook her head: shhh! I don&#x2019;t know, and don&#x2019;t you dare ask! So Sarah just gave half a nod, clamped her lips shut, and returned her attention to the table, proffering the platter of cold ham: all would come clear in good time, but it did not do to ask. It did not do to speak at all, unless directly addressed. It was best to be deaf as a stone to these conversations, and seem as incapable of forming an opinion on them. <br> &nbsp;<br> Miss Mary lifted the serving fork and skewered a slice of ham. &#x2018;Papadoesn&#x2019;t mean your beaux, Lydia &#x2013; do you, Papa?&#x2019; <br> &nbsp;<br> Mr B., leaning out of the way so that Mrs Hill could pour his coffee, said that indeed he did not mean her beaux: Lydia&#x2019;s beaux always seemed to be in more than plentiful supply. But of working men there was a genuine shortage, which is why he had settled with this lad so promptly &#x2013; this with an apologetic glance to Mrs Hill, as she moved around him and went to fill his wife&#x2019;s cup &#x2013; though the quarter day of Michaelmas was not quite yet upon them, it being the more usual occasion for the hiring and dismissal of servants.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;You don&#x2019;t object to this hasty act, I take it, Mrs Hill?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Indeed I am very pleased to hear of it, sir, if he be a decent sort of fellow.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;He is, Mrs Hill; I can assure you of that.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Who is he, Papa? Is he from one of the cottages? Do we know the family?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mr B. raised his cup before replying. &#x2018;He is a fine upstanding young man, of good family. I had an excellent character of him.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;I, for one, am very glad that we will have a nice young man to drive us about,&#x2019; said Lydia, &#x2018;for when Mr Hill is perched up there on the carriage box it always looks like we have trained a monkey, shaved him here and there and put him in a hat.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mrs Hill stepped away from the table, and set the coffee pot down on the buffet.<br> &#x2018;Lydia!&#x2019; Jane and Elizabeth spoke at once.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;What? He does, you know he does. Just like a spider-monkey, like the one Mrs Long&#x2019;s sister brought with her from London.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mrs Hill looked down at a willow-pattern dish, empty, though crusted round with egg. The three tiny people still crossed their tiny bridge, and the tiny boat crawled like an earwig across the china sea, and all was calm there, and unchanging, and perfect. She breathed. Miss Lydia meant no harm, she never did. And however heedlessly she expressed herself, she was right: this change was certainly to be welcomed. Mr Hill had become, quite suddenly, old. Last winter had been a worrying time: the long drives, the late nights while the ladies danced or played at cards; he had got deeply cold, and had shivered for hours by the fire on his return, his breath rattling in his chest. The coming winter&#x2019;s balls and parties might have done for him entirely. A nice young man to drive the carriage, and to take up the slack about the house; it could only be to the good.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mrs Bennet had heard tell, she was now telling her husband and daughters delightedly, of how in the best households they had nothing but manservants waiting on the family and guests, on account of every- one knowing that they cost more in the way of wages, and that there was a high tax to pay on them, because all the fit strong fellows were wanted for the fields and for the war. When it was known that the Bennets now had a smart young man about the place, waiting at table, opening the doors, it would be a thing of great note and marvel in the neighbourhood.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;I am sure our daughters should be vastly grateful to you, for letting us appear to such advantage, Mr Bennet. You are so considerate. What, pray, is the young fellow&#x2019;s name?<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;His given name is James,&#x2019; Mr Bennet said. &#x2018;The surname is a very common one. He is called Smith.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;James Smith.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> It was Mrs Hill who had spoken, barely above her breath, but the words were said. Jane lifted her cup and sipped; Elizabeth raised her eyebrows but stared at her plate; Mrs B. glanced round at her house- keeper. Sarah watched a flush rise up Mrs Hill&#x2019;s throat; it was all so new and strange that even Mrs Hill had forgot herself for a moment. And then Mr B. swallowed, and cleared his throat, breaking the silence.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;As I said, a common enough name. I was obliged to act with some celerity in order to secure him, which is why you were not sooner informed, Mrs Hill; I would much rather have consulted you in advance.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> Cheeks pink, the housekeeper bowed her head in acknowledgement.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Since the servants&#x2019; attics are occupied by your good self, your husband and the housemaids, I have told him he might sleep above the stables. Other than that, I will leave the practical and domestic details to you. He knows he is to defer to you in all things.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Thank you, sir,&#x2019; she murmured.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Well.&#x2019; Mr B. shook out his paper, and retreated behind it. &#x2018;There we are, then. I am glad that it is all settled.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Yes,&#x2019; said Mrs B. &#x2018;Are you not always saying, Hill, how you need another pair of hands about the place? This will lighten your load, will it not? This will lighten all your loads.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> Their mistress took in Sarah with a wave of her plump hand, and then, with a flap towards the outer reaches of the house, indicated the rest of the domestic servants: Mr Hill who was hunkered in the kitchen, riddling the fire, and Polly who was, at that moment, thumping down the back stairs with a pile of wet Turkish towels and a scowl.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;You should be very grateful to Mr Bennet for his thoughtfulness, I am sure.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Thank you, sir,&#x2019; said Sarah.<br> &nbsp;<br> The words, though softly spoken, made Mrs Hill glance across at her; the two of them caught eyes a moment.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Thank you, sir,&#x2019; said Mrs Hill.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mrs Bennet dabbed a further spoonful of jam on her remaining piece of buttered muffin, popped it in her mouth, and chewed it twice; she spoke around her mouthful: &#x2018;That&#x2019;ll be all, Hill.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mr B. looked up from his paper at his wife, and then at his housekeeper.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Yes, thank you very much, Mrs Hill,&#x2019; he said. &#x2018;That will be all for now.&#x2019;</p><h2>Batmouse (Storytime)</h2><p>When Pip the mouse sees a bat flying over his home, he has a big idea &#x2013; when he grows up, he's going to be a BAT!<br><br>Pip makes himself some cardboard wings, and prepares for take-off.

When police and fire department personnel rush door to door in a frenzied evacuation effort, they discover the week-old corpse of an apparent suicide. But the gunshot victim is less gruesome than what they find in his lap: a photo album of seven brutally murdered young women -- one per year, for seven years. And when the suicide victim is identified as a former suspect in one of the murders, the news turns Elvis Cole's world upside down. <br> <br> Three years earlier Lionel Byrd was brought to trial for the murder of a female prostitute named Yvonne Bennett. A taped confession coerced by the police inspired a prominent defense attorney to take Byrd's case, and Elvis Cole was hired to investigate. It was Cole's eleventh-hour discovery of an exculpatory videotape that allowed Lionel Byrd to walk free. Elvis was hailed as a hero. <br> <br> But the discovery of the death album in Byrd's lap now brands Elvis as an unwitting accomplice to murder. Captured in photographs that could only have been taken by the murderer, Yvonne Bennett was the fifth of the seven victims -- two more young women were murdered after Lionel Byrd walked free. So Elvis can't help but wonder -- did he, Elvis Cole, cost two more young women their lives? <br> <br> Shut out of the investigation by a special LAPD task force determined to close the case, Elvis Cole and Joe Pike desperately fight to uncover the truth about Lionel Byrd and his nightmare album of death -- a truth hidden by lies, politics, and corruption in a world where nothing is what it seems to be. <br> <br> <i>Chasing Darkness</i> is a blistering thriller from the bestselling author who sets the standard for intense, powerful crime writing.</p><p>Robert Crais is the author of many novels, including the <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers <i>The Last Detective</i>, <i>Hostage</i>, and <i>L.A.

Some plot twists require leaps of faith, but the story engages because Cole and his compatriot, James Pike, exude personality. At its heart, the plot focuses upon the apparent suicide of Lionel Byrd, whose body is discovered with an album containing pictures of seven murdered women. Cole and Pike quickly realize this is more than suicide. Narrator James Daniels has a workmanlike style that meshes seamlessly with the book&#39;s well-honed dialogue. In particular, Daniels succeeds wonderfully in distinguishing between Cole and Pike, whose smooth banter allows the story to flow at just the right pace as it builds to its surprising conclusion.

Set in the rich farmland of California's Salinas Valley, this sprawling and often brutal novel follows the intertwined destinies of two families&#x2014;the Trasks and the Hamiltons&#x2014;whose generations helplessly reenact the fall of Adam and Eve and the poisonous rivalry of Cain and Abel.<br><br>The masterpiece of Steinbeck&#x2019;s later years, <i>East of Eden</i> is a work in which Steinbeck created his most mesmerizing characters and explored his most enduring themes: the mystery of identity, the inexplicability of love, and the murderous consequences of love's absence. Adapted for the 1955 film directed by Elia Kazan introducing James Dean, and read by thousands as the book that brought Oprah&#x2019;s Book Club back, East of Eden has remained vitally present in American culture for over half a century.</p><p><p><b>John Steinbeck</b>, born in Salinas, California, in 1902, grew up in a fertile agricultural valley, about twenty-five miles from the Pacific Coast.

It is a long narrow swale between two ranges of mountains, and the Salinas River winds and twists up the center until it falls at last into Monterey Bay.</p><p>I remember my childhood names for grasses and secret flowers. I remember where a toad may live and what time the birds awaken in the summer&#x2014;and what trees and seasons smelled like&#x2014;how people looked and walked and smelled even. The memory of odors is very rich.</p><p>I remember that the Gabilan Mountains to the east of the valley were light gay mountains full of sun and loveliness and a kind of invitation, so that you wanted to climb into their warm foothills almost as you want to climb into the lap of a beloved mother. They were beckoning mountains with a brown grass love. The Santa Lucias stood up against the sky to the west and kept the valley from the open sea, and they were dark and brooding&#x2014;unfriendly and dangerous. I always found in myself a dread of west and a love of east. Where I ever got such an idea I cannot say, unless it could be that the morning came over the peaks of the Gabilans and the night drifted back from the ridges of the Santa Lucias. It may be that the birth and death of the day had some part in my feeling about the two ranges of mountains.</p><p>From both sides of the valley little streams slipped out of the hill canyons and fell into the bed of the Salinas River. In the winter of wet years the streams ran full-freshet, and they swelled the river until sometimes it raged and boiled, bank full, and then it was a destroyer. The river tore the edges of the farm lands and washed whole acres down; it toppled barns and houses into itself, to go floating and bobbing away. It trapped cows and pigs and sheep and drowned them in its muddy brown water and carried them to the sea. Then when the late spring came, the river drew in from its edges and the sand banks appeared. And in the summer the river didn&#x2019;t run at all above ground. Some pools would be left in the deep swirl places under a high bank. The tules and grasses grew back, and willows straightened up with the flood debris in their upper branches. The Salinas was only a part-time river. The summer sun drove it underground. It was not a fine river at all, but it was the only one we had and so we boasted about it&#x2014;how dangerous it was in a wet winter and how dry it was in a dry summer. You can boast about anything if it&#x2019;s all you have. Maybe the less you have, the more you are required to boast.</p><p>The floor of the Salinas Valley, between the ranges and below the foothills, is level because this valley used to be the bottom of a hundred-mile inlet from the sea. The river mouth at Moss Landing was centuries ago the entrance to this long inland water. Once, fifty miles down the valley, my father bored a well. The drill came up first with topsoil and then with gravel and then with white sea sand full of shells and even pieces of whalebone. There were twenty feet of sand and then black earth again, and even a piece of redwood, that imperishable wood that does not rot. Before the inland sea the valley must have been a forest. And those things had happened right under our feet. And it seemed to me sometimes at night that I could feel both the sea and the redwood forest before it.</p><p>On the wide level acres of the valley the topsoil lay deep and fertile. It required only a rich winter of rain to make it break forth in grass and flowers. The spring flowers in a wet year were unbelievable. The whole valley floor, and the foothills too, would be carpeted with lupins and poppies. Once a woman told me that colored flowers would seem more bright if you added a few white flowers to give the colors definition. Every petal of blue lupin is edged with white, so that a field of lupins is more blue than you can imagine. And mixed with these were splashes of California poppies. These too are of a burning color&#x2014;not orange, not gold, but if pure gold were liquid and could raise a cream, that golden cream might be like the color of the poppies. When their season was over the yellow mustard came up and grew to a great height. When my grandfather came into the valley the mustard was so tall that a man on horseback showed only his head above the yellow flowers. On the uplands the grass would be strewn with buttercups, with hen-and-chickens, with black-centered yellow violets. And a little later in the season there would be red and yellow stands of Indian paintbrush. These were the flowers of the open places exposed to the sun.</p><p>Under the live oaks, shaded and dusky, the maidenhair flourished and gave a good smell, and under the mossy banks of the water courses whole clumps of five-fingered ferns and goldy-backs hung down. Then there were harebells, tiny lanterns, cream white and almost sinful looking, and these were so rare and magical that a child, finding one, felt singled out and special all day long.</p><p>When June came the grasses headed out and turned brown, and the hills turned a brown which was not brown but a gold and saffron and red&#x2014;an indescribable color. And from then on until the next rains the earth dried and the streams stopped. Cracks appeared on the level ground. The Salinas River sank under its sand. The wind blew down the valley, picking up dust and straws, and grew stronger and harsher as it went south. It stopped in the evening. It was a rasping nervous wind, and the dust particles cut into a man&#x2019;s skin and burned his eyes. Men working in the fields wore goggles and tied handkerchiefs around their noses to keep the dirt out.</p><p>The valley land was deep and rich, but the foothills wore only a skin of topsoil no deeper than the grass roots; and the farther up the hills you went, the thinner grew the soil, with flints sticking through, until at the brush line it was a kind of dry flinty gravel that reflected the hot sun blindingly.</p><p>I have spoken of the rich years when the rainfall was plentiful. But there were dry years too, and they put a terror on the valley. The water came in a thirty-year cycle. There would be five or six wet and wonderful years when there might be nineteen to twenty-five inches of rain, and the land would shout with grass. Then would come six or seven pretty good years of twelve to sixteen inches of rain. And then the dry years would come, and sometimes there would be only seven or eight inches of rain. The land dried up and the grasses headed out miserably a few inches high and great bare scabby places appeared in the valley. The live oaks got a crusty look and the sage-brush was gray. The land cracked and the springs dried up and the cattle listlessly nibbled dry twigs. Then the farmers and the ranchers would be filled with disgust for the Salinas Valley. The cows would grow thin and sometimes starve to death. People would have to haul water in barrels to their farms just for drinking. Some families would sell out for nearly nothing and move away. And it never failed that during the dry years the people forgot about the rich years, and during the wet years they lost all memory of the dry years. It was always that way.</p><p>[2]</p><p>And that was the long Salinas Valley. Its history was like that of the rest of the state. First there were Indians, an inferior breed without energy, inventiveness, or culture, a people that lived on grubs and grasshoppers and shellfish, too lazy to hunt or fish. They ate what they could pick up and planted nothing. They pounded bitter acorns for flour. Even their warfare was a weary pantomime.</p><p>Then the hard, dry Spaniards came exploring through, greedy and realistic, and their greed was for gold or God. They collected souls as they collected jewels. They gathered mountains and valleys, rivers and whole horizons, the way a man might now gain title to building lots. These tough, dried-up men moved restlessly up the coast and down. Some of them stayed on grants as large as principalities, given to them by Spanish kings who had not the faintest idea of the gift. These first owners lived in poor feudal settlements, and their cattle ranged freely and multiplied. Periodically the owners killed the cattle for their hides and tallow and left the meat to the vultures and coyotes.</p><p>When the Spaniards came they had to give everything they saw a name. This is the first duty of any explorer&#x2014;a duty and a privilege. You must name a thing before you can note it on your hand-drawn map. Of course they were religious people, and the men who could read and write, who kept the records and drew the maps, were the tough untiring priests who traveled with the soldiers. Thus the first names of places were saints&#x2019; names or religious holidays celebrated at stopping places. There are many saints, but they are not inexhaustible, so that we find repetitions in the first namings. We have San Miguel, St. Michael, San Ardo, San Bernardo, San Benito, San Lorenzo, San Carlos, San Francisquito. And then the holidays&#x2014;Natividad, the Nativity; Nacimiente, the Birth; Soledad, the Solitude.

While she spends most of the book in Italy, it seems that Gotham City is never far behind. She encounters such regulars as Cheetah, Mr. Freeze, The Scarecrow, and Batman, but questioning whether they are real or imaginary leaves her doubting her sanity. The fact that her meetings with Batman are filled with sexual tension so thick that you can cut it with a claw adds yet another dimension to her troubles. All of these events revolve around the heart of the story, which is that Catwoman goes to Italy both to settle a score with the Falcone crime family and to try to learn the identity of her mother. Bringing The Riddler with her on this trip turns out to be both an inspired choice and more trouble than it's worth. <i>When in Rome</i> takes places chronologically between two Batman stories by the same author/artist team: <i>The Long Halloween</i> (1999) and <i>Dark Victory</i> (2001, both DC Comics). Fans of those titles will definitely appreciate this one, but there is enough backstory included so that it isn't necessary to have read the other books. This page-turning adventure will fly off the shelves.<i> Andrea Lipinski, New York Public Library</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She alights to finds a pretty young man with an anarchist tattoo dying on the tarmac just outside the dock gates. He bleeds to death in her arms...and all over her silk shirt.</p><p>Enraged by the loss of the clothing, the damage to her car, and this senseless waste of human life, Phryne promises to find out who is responsible. But she doesn't yet know how deeply into the mire she'll have to go: bank robbery, tattoo parlours, pubs, spiritualist halls, and Anarchists. Then when someone kidnaps her cherished companion, Dot, Phryne will stop at nothing to retrieve her.</p></p><p><p>Kerry Greenwood was born in the Melbourne suburb of Footscray and after wandering far and wide, she returned to live there. She has degrees in English and Law from Melbourne University and was admitted to the legal profession on the 1st April 1982, a day which she finds both soothing and significant. Kerry has written three series, a number of plays, including <em>The Troubadours</em> with Stephen D'Arcy, is an award-winning children's writer and has edited and contributed to several anthologies. The Phryne Fisher series (pronounced Fry-knee, to rhyme with briny) began in 1989 with <em>Cocaine Blues</em> which was a great success. Kerry has written twenty books in this series with no sign yet of Miss Fisher hanging up her pearl-handled pistol. Kerry says that as long as people want to read them, she can keep writing them. In 2003 Kerry won the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Australian Association.</p>Greenwood&#39;s flapper heroine, Phrynne (FRYnie) Fisher, is improbable but completely delightful, especially in the elegant performance of Stephanie Daniel, a master of the sophisticated deadpan delivery that makes this P.G. Wodehouse-style of comedy work. The setup: Phrynne is driving her Hispano Suiza past Victoria Dock one night when her windshield explodes. Two fleeing thugs fire more shots at her, and she finds a very beautiful young man dying of bullet wounds. This annoys her greatly as there are too few beautiful young men in the world as it is. She assembles her team of orphaned wards, freelance enforcers, and devoted staff and all too soon has sorted out a nest of murderous anarchists and solved an unrelated kidnapping along the way.

Heinlein was the greatest science fiction writer of his era. His bestselling Stranger in a Strange Land was one of the biggest cult books of the century. The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress tells an unforgettable tale of a Lunar revolution in 2076--led by a one-armed computer technician, an aging academic, and a sentient all-knowing computer.</p><p>Tom Clancy has said of Robert A. Heinlein, &#34;We proceed down the path marked by his ideas. He shows us where the future is.&#34; Nowhere is this more true than in Heinlein&#39;s gripping tale of revolution on the moon in 2076, where &#34;Loonies&#34; are kept poor and oppressed by an Earth-based Authority that turns huge profits at their expense. A small band of dissidents, including a one-armed computer jock, a radical young woman, a past-his-prime academic and a nearly omnipotent computer named Mike, ignite the fires of revolution despite the near certainty of failure and death.Winner of the 1967 Hugo award, this novel marked Heinlein's partial return to his best form. He draws many historical parallels with the War of Independence, and clearly shows his own libertarian political views.<p>In what is considered one of his most hair-raising, thought-provoking and outrageous adventures, the master of modern SF tells the strange story of an even stranger world -- 21st century Luna, a harsh penal colony where a revolt is plotted between a bashful computer and a ragtag collection of maverick humans. A revolt that goes beautifully until the inevitable happens. But the problem with the inevitable is that it always happens.</p></p><h2>The Ionian Mission (Aubrey/Maturin Novels, 8) (Book 8)</h2><p><p><strong>"O'Brian is one author who can put a spark of character into the sawdust of time, and <em>The Ionian Mission</em> is another rattling good yarn."&#x2015;Stephen Vaughan, <em>The Observer</em></strong></p> Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin, veterans now of many battles, return in this novel to the seas where they first sailed as shipmates.

No heat, no smoke, but still the forests burned, crowning with red and yellow and orange; a cold conflagration with the coming of fall, and the leaves resignedly descending. There was mortality in the air, borne on the first hint of winter breezes, the threatening chill of them, and the animals prepared for the coming snows. The foraging had begun, the filling of bellies for leaner times. Hunger would make the more vulnerable creatures take risks in order to feed, and the predators would be waiting. Black spiders squatted at the corners of their webs, not yet slumbering. There were still stray insects to be had, and further trophies to be added to their collections of withered husks. Winter coats grew thick, and fur began to lighten, the better to blend in against the snow. Contrails of geese arrowed the skies like refugees fleeing a coming conflict, abandoning those forced to stay and face what was to come.<br> <br>The ravens were motionless. Many of their far-northern brethren had headed south to escape the worst of the winter, but not these birds. They were huge yet sleek, their eyes bright with an alien intelligence. Some on this remote road had noticed them already, and if they had company on their walks, or in their automobiles, they commented on the presence of the birds. Yes, it was agreed, they were larger than the usual ravens, and perhaps, too, they brought with them a sense of discomfort, these hunched beings, these patient, treacherous scouts. They were perched deep among the branches of an ancient oak, an organism approaching the end of its days, its leaves falling earlier each year, so that by the end of every September it was already bare, a charred thing amid the flames, as though the all-consuming fire had already had its way with it, leaving behind only the smoke smudges of long-abandoned nests. The tree stood at the edge of a small copse that jutted slightly at this place to follow the curvature of the road, with the oak as its farthest point. Once there were others like it, but the men who built the road had cut them down many years before. It was now alone of its kind, and soon it too would be gone.<br> <br>But the ravens had come to it, for the ravens liked dying things.<br> <br>The smaller birds fled their company, and regarded the intruders warily from the cover of evergreen foliage. They had silenced the woods behind them. They radiated threat: the stillness of them, their claws curled upon the branches, the bladelike sharpness of their beaks. They were stalkers, watchers, waiting for the hunt to begin. The ravens were so statuesque, so immobile, that they might have been mistaken for misshapen outcroppings of the tree itself, tumorous growths upon its bark. It was unusual to see so many together, for ravens are not social birds; a pair, yes, but not six, not like this, not without food in sight.<br> <br>Walk on, walk on. Leave them behind, but not before casting one last anxious glance at them, for to see them was to be reminded of what it is to be pursued, to be tracked from above while the hunters follow remorselessly. That is what ravens do; they lead the wolves to their prey, and take a portion of the spoils as payment for their labors. You want them to move. You want them to leave. Even the common raven was somehow disturbing, but these were not common ravens. No, these were most uncommon birds. Darkness was approaching, and still they waited. They might almost have been slumbering were it not for the way the fading light caught the blackness of their eyes, and how they captured the early moon when the clouds broke, imprisoning its image within themselves.<br> <br>A short-tailed weasel emerged from the rotted stump that was her home and tested the air. Its brown fur was already altering, the darkness growing out of it, the mammal becoming a ghost of itself. She had been aware of the birds for some time, but she was hungry and anxious to feed. Her litter had dispersed, and she would not breed again until the new year. Her nest was lined with mouse fur for insulation, but the little larder in which she had stored her surplus of slain rodents was now empty. The weasel had to eat forty percent of her own body weight each day in order to survive. That was about four mice a day, but the animals had been scarce on her regular routes.<br> <br>The ravens seemed to ignore her appearance, but the weasel was too shrewd to risk her life on the absence of movement. She turned herself so that she was facing into her nest, and used her black-tipped tail as bait to see if the birds were tempted to strike. If they did, they would miss her body in aiming for her tail and she would retreat to the safety of the stump, but the ravens did not react. The weasel&#x2019;s nose twitched. Suddenly there was sound, and light. Headlights bathed the ravens, and now their heads moved, following the beams. The weasel, torn between fright and hunger, allowed her belly to choose. She disappeared into the woods while the ravens were distracted, and was soon lost from sight.<br> <br>The car wound its way along the road, traveling faster than was wise and taking the bends more widely than it should, for it was hard to see vehicles approaching from the opposite direction, and a traveler unfamiliar with this route might easily have found himself in a head-on collision, or tearing a path through the bushes that lined the road. He might, were this the kind of road that travelers took, but few visitors came here. The town absorbed their impact, the apparent dullness of it dissuading further investigation, then spat them back the way they came, over the bridge and toward Route 1, there to continue north to the border, or south to the highway and on to Augusta and Portland, the big cities, the places that the peninsula&#x2019;s residents strove so hard to avoid. So no tourists, but strangers sometimes paused here on their life&#x2019;s journey, and after a time, if they proved suitable, the peninsula would find a place for them, and they would become part of a community with its back to the land and its face set hard against the sea.<br> <br>There were many such communities in this state; they attracted those who wished to escape, those who sought the protection of the frontier, for this was still an edge state with boundaries of wood and sea. Some chose the anonymity of the forests, where the wind in the trees made a sound like the breaking of waves upon the shore, an echo of the ocean&#x2019;s song to the east. But here, in this place, there were forest <i>and</i> sea; there were rocks ringing the inlet, and a narrow causeway that paralleled the bridge linking the mainland and those who had chosen to set themselves apart from it; there was a town with a single main street, and enough money to fund a small police department. The peninsula was large, with a scattered population beyond the cluster of buildings around Main Street. Also, for administrative and geographic reasons long forgotten, the township of Pastor&#x2019;s Bay stretched across the causeway and west to the mainland. For years the county sheriff policed Pastor&#x2019;s Bay until the town looked at its budget and decided that not only could it afford its own force, it might actually save money in the process, and so the Pastor&#x2019;s Bay Police Department was born.<br> <br>But when locals spoke of Pastor&#x2019;s Bay it was the peninsula to which they were referring, and the police were <i>their</i> police. Outsiders often referred to it as &#x201c;the island,&#x201d; even though it was not an island because of the natural connector to the mainland, although it was the bridge that received the most traffic. It was wide enough to take a decent two-lane road, and high enough to avoid any risk of the community being entirely cut off in foul weather, although there were times when the waves rose and washed over the road, and a stone cross on the mainland side attested to the former presence on this earth of one Maylock Wheeler, who was washed away in 1997 while walking his dog, Kaya. The dog survived, and was adopted by a couple on the mainland, for Maylock Wheeler had been a bachelor of the most pronounced sort. But the dog kept trying to return to the island, as those who are born of such places often will, and eventually the couple gave up trying to hold on to it, and it was taken in by Grover Corneau, who was the chief of police at the time. It remained with Grover until his retirement, and a week separated the deaths of the dog and its owner. A photograph of them together remained on the wall of the Pastor&#x2019;s Bay Police Department. It made Kurt Allan, Grover&#x2019;s replacement, wonder if he also should acquire a dog, but Allan lived alone, and was not used to animals.<br> <br>It was Allan&#x2019;s car that now passed beneath the old oak and pulled up before the house across the road. He looked to the west and shielded his eyes against the last of the setting sun, bisected by the horizon. There were more cars coming. He had told the others to follow. The woman would need them. Detectives from the Maine State Police were also on their way following the confirmation of the AMBER Alert, and the National Crime Information Center had automatically been notified of a missing child. A decision would be made within the coming hours on whether to seek further assistance from the FBI.<br> <br>The house was a ranch-style dwelling, neatly kept and freshly painted. The fallen leaves had been raked and added to a compost pile at the sheltered side of the building. For a woman without a man to help her, a woman not of this place, she had managed well, he thought.<br> <br>And the ravens watched as Allan knocked on the door, and the door opened, and words were spoken, and he stepped inside, and there was no sound or movement from within for a time. Two more cars arrived. From the first vehicle stepped an elderly man with a worn leather physician&#x2019;s bag. The other was driven by a woman of late middle age wearing a blue overcoat that caught in the car door as she rushed to the house. It tore, but she did not stop to examine the damage after wrenching it free. There were more important matters to which to attend.<br> <br>The new arrivals had come together and were halfway across the yard when the front door opened wide and a woman ran toward them. She was in her late thirties, carrying a little weight on her waist and her thighs, her hair flying loose behind her. They stopped suddenly at the sight of her, and the middle-aged woman raised her arms as though expecting the other to fall into her embrace, but instead the younger woman pushed her way past them, jostling the doctor, one of her shoes falling from her foot, and the white stones on the drive tore at her skin so that she left smears of blood across them. She stumbled and landed heavily, and when she rose again her jeans were ripped, and her knees were scratched, and one of her fingernails was broken. Kurt Allan appeared in the doorway, but the woman was already on the road and her hands were at her mouth and she screamed a name over and over and over...<br> <br>&#x201c;Anna! Anna! Anna!&#x201d;<br> <br>She was crying now, and she wanted to run, but the road curved to the right and to the left, and she did not know which way to turn. The middle-aged woman came to her and wrapped her in her arms at last, even as her charge fought against her, and the doctor and Allan were approaching as she screamed the name again. Birds took flight from the surrounding trees, and unseen creatures burst from brush and scrub as though to carry the message.<br> <br><i>The girl is gone, the girl is gone.</i><br> <br>Only the ravens remained. The sun was at last swallowed by the horizon, and true darkness began to fall. The ravens became part of it, absorbed by it and absorbing it in turn, for their blackness was deeper than any night.<br> <br>Eventually the weasel returned. The fat corpse of a field mouse hung limply in her jaws, and she could taste its blood in her mouth. It was all that she could do not to tear it apart as soon as she had killed it, but her instincts told her to control her urges. Her self-restraint was rewarded, though, for a smaller mouse had crossed her path as she returned to her home, and she fed on that instead before hiding its remains. Perhaps she would retrieve them later, once her larger prize was safely stored away.<br> <br>She did not hear the raven&#x2019;s approach. Her first awareness of it came with the impact of its talons upon her back, tearing through her coat and into her flesh. It pinned her to the ground, then slowly began to peck at her, its long beak carving neat holes in her body. The raven did not feed upon her. It simply tortured her to death, taking its time over her agonies. When it had reduced her to a mess of blood and fur, it left the corpse for the scavengers and rejoined its companions. They were waiting for the hunt to begin, and they were curious about the hunter who was to come.<br> <br>No, the one who had sent them was curious about him, and they watched on his behalf.<br> <br>For he was the greatest predator of them all.</p><h2>The Star-Spangled Banner</h2><p>The story of our national anthem, with music, illustrations, and a reproduction of Francis Scott Key&#39;s original manuscript.</p><p></p><h2>Emerald Green (The Ruby Red Trilogy, 3)</h2><p><p>Gwen has a destiny to fulfill, but no one will tell her what it is.<br> She's only recently learned that she is the Ruby, the final member of the time-traveling Circle of Twelve, and since then nothing has been going right.

I knew I couldn&#x2019;t get away. With difficulty, I stumbled a few steps back. <br>The man followed me. &#x201c;I will wipe that which is displeasing to God off the face of the earth!&#x201d; he boomed. &#x201c;The ground will soak up your blood!&#x201d; <br>I had at least two smart retorts to these sinister words on the tip of my tongue. (Soak up my blood? Oh, come off it, this is a tiled floor.) But I was in such a panic that I couldn&#x2019;t get a word out. The man didn&#x2019;t look as if he&#x2019;d appreciate my little joke at this moment anyway. In fact, he didn&#x2019;t look as if he had a sense of humor at all. <br>I took another step back and came up against a wall. The killer laughed out loud. Okay, so maybe he did have a sense of humor, but it wasn&#x2019;t much like mine. <br>&#x201c;Die, demon!&#x201d; he cried, plunging his sword into my breast without any more ado. <br>I woke up, screaming. I was wet with sweat, and my heart hurt as if a blade really had pierced it. What a horrible dream! But was that really surprising? <br>My experiences of yesterday (and the day before) weren&#x2019;t exactly likely to make me nestle down comfortably in bed and sleep the sleep of the just. Unwanted thoughts were writhing around in my mind like flesh-eating plants gone crazy. <i>Gideon was only pretending</i>, I thought <i>. He doesn&#x2019;t really love me.</i> <br>&#x201c;He hardly has to do anything to attract girls,&#x201d; I heard Count Saint-Germain saying in his soft, deep voice, again and again. And &#x201c;Nothing is easier to calculate than the reactions of a woman in love.&#x201d; <br>Oh, yes? So how does a woman in love react when she finds out that someone&#x2019;s been lying to her and manipulating her? She spends hours on the phone to her best friend, that&#x2019;s how, then she sits about in the dark, unable to get to sleep, asking herself why the hell she ever fell for the guy in the first place, crying her eyes out at the same time because she wants him so much&nbsp;&#x2026; Right, so it doesn&#x2019;t take a genius to calculate that. <br>The lighted numbers on the alarm clock beside my bed said 3:10, so I must have nodded off after all. I&#x2019;d even slept for more than two hours. And someone&#x2014;my mum?&#x2014;must have come in to cover me up, because all I could remember was huddling on the bed with my arms around my knees, listening to my heart beating much too fast. <br>Odd that a broken heart can beat at all, come to think of it. <br>&#x201c;It feels like it&#x2019;s made of red splinters with sharp edges, and they&#x2019;re slicing me up from inside so that I&#x2019;ll bleed to death,&#x201d; I&#x2019;d said, trying to describe the state of my heart to Lesley (okay, so it sounds at least as corny as the stuff the character in my dream was saying, but sometimes the truth <i>is</i> corny). And Lesley had said sympathetically, &#x201c;I know just how you feel. When Max dumped me, I thought at first I&#x2019;d die of grief. Grief and multiple organ failure. Because there&#x2019;s a grain of truth in all those things they say about love: it goes to your kidneys, it punches you in the stomach, it breaks your heart and&nbsp;&#x2026; er&nbsp;&#x2026; it scurries over your liver like a louse. But first, that will all pass off; second, it&#x2019;s not as hopeless as it looks to you; and third, your heart isn&#x2019;t made of glass.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Stone, not glass,&#x201d; I corrected her, sobbing. &#x201c;My heart is a gemstone, and Gideon&#x2019;s broken it into thousands of pieces, just like in Aunt Maddy&#x2019;s vision.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Sounds kind of cool&#x2014;but no! Hearts are really made of very different stuff, you take my word for it.&#x201d; Lesley cleared her throat, and her tone of voice got positively solemn, as if she were revealing the greatest secret in the history of the world. &#x201c;Hearts are made of something much tougher. It&#x2019;s unbreakable, and you can reshape it anytime you like. Hearts are made to a secret formula.&#x201d; <br>More throat-clearing to heighten the suspense. I instinctively held my breath. <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re made of stuff like <i>marzipan</i>!&#x201d; Lesley announced. <br>&#x201c;Marzipan?&#x201d; For a moment I stopped sobbing and grinned instead. <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right, marzipan,&#x201d; Lesley repeated in deadly earnest. &#x201c;The best sort, with lots of real ground almonds in it.&#x201d; <br>I almost giggled. But then I remembered that I was the unhappiest girl in the world. I sniffed, and said, &#x201c;If that&#x2019;s so, then Gideon has <i>bitten off</i> a piece of my heart! And he&#x2019;s nibbled away the chocolate coating around it too! You ought to have seen the way he looked when&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>But before I could start crying all over again, Lesley sighed audibly. <br>&#x201c;Gwenny, I hate to say so, but all this miserable weeping and wailing does no one any good. You have to stop it!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not doing it on purpose,&#x201d; I told her. &#x201c;It just keeps on breaking out of me. One moment I&#x2019;m still the happiest girl in the world, and then he tells me he&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Okay, so Gideon behaved like a bastard,&#x201d; Lesley interrupted me, &#x201c;although it&#x2019;s hard to understand why. I mean, <i>hello</i>? Why on earth would girls in love be easier to manipulate? I&#x2019;d have thought it was just the opposite. Girls in love are like ticking time bombs. You never know what they&#x2019;ll do next. Gideon and his male chauvinist friend the count have made a big mistake.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I really thought Gideon was in love with me. The idea that he was only pretending is so&#x2026;&#x201d; Mean? Cruel? No word seemed enough to describe my feelings properly. <br>&#x201c;Oh, sweetie&#x2014;look, in other circumstances, you could wallow in grief for weeks on end, but you can&#x2019;t afford to do that right now. You need your energy for other things. Like surviving, for instance.&#x201d; Lesley sounded unusually stern. &#x201c;So kindly pull yourself together.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what Xemerius said, too. Before he went off and left me all alone.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Your little invisible monster is right! You have to keep a cool head now and put all the facts together. Ugh, what was that? Hang on, I have to open a window. Bertie just did a disgusting fart. Bad dog! Now, where was I? Yes, that&#x2019;s it, we have to find out what your grandfather hid in your house.&#x201d; Lesley&#x2019;s voice rose slightly. &#x201c;I must admit Raphael has turned out pretty useful. He&#x2019;s not as stupid as you might think.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;As <i>you</i> might think, you mean.&#x201d; Raphael was Gideon&#x2019;s little brother, who had just started going to our school. He&#x2019;d discovered that the riddle my grandfather had left behind was all about geographical coordinates. And they had led straight to our house. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d love to know how much Raphael has found out about the secrets of the Guardians and Gideon&#x2019;s time traveling.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Could be more than we might assume,&#x201d; said Lesley. &#x201c;Anyway, he wasn&#x2019;t swallowing my story when I told him the coordinates were only because puzzle games like this were the latest fad in London. But he was clever enough not to ask any more questions.&#x201d; She paused for a moment. &#x201c;He has rather attractive eyes.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yup.&#x201d; They really were attractive, which reminded me that Gideon&#x2019;s eyes were exactly the same. Green and surrounded by thick, dark lashes. <br>&#x201c;Not that that impresses me. Only making an observation.&#x201d; <br> <i>I&#x2019;ve fallen in love with you.</i> Gideon had sounded deadly serious when he said that, looking straight at me. And I&#x2019;d stared back and believed every word of it! My tears started flowing again, and I could hardly hear what Lesley was saying. <br>&#x201c;&#x2026; but I hope it&#x2019;s a long letter, or a kind of diary, with your grandfather explaining everything the rest of them won&#x2019;t tell you and a bit more. Then we can finally stop groping around in the dark and make a proper plan.&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>Eyes like that shouldn&#x2019;t be allowed. Or there ought to be a law saying boys with such gorgeous eyes had to wear sunglasses all the time. Unless they canceled out the eyes by having huge jug ears or something like that. <br>&#x201c;Gwenny? You&#x2019;re not crying again, are you?&#x201d; Now Lesley sounded just like Mrs. Counter, our geography teacher, when people told her they were afraid they&#x2019;d forgotten to do their homework. &#x201c;Sweetie, this won&#x2019;t do! You must stop twisting the knife in your own heart with all this drama! We have to&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Keep a cool head. Yes, you&#x2019;re right.&#x201d; It cost me an effort, but I tried to put the thought of Gideon&#x2019;s eyes out of my mind and inject a little confidence into my voice. I owed Lesley that. After all, she was the one who&#x2019;d been propping me up for days. Before she rang off, I had to tell her how glad I was that she was my friend. Even if it made me start to cry again, but this time because it made me so emotional! <br>&#x201c;Same here,&#x201d; Lesley assured me. &#x201c;My life would be dead boring without you!&#x201d; <br>When she ended the call, it was just before midnight, and I really had felt a little better for a few minutes. But now, at ten past three, I&#x2019;d have loved to call her back and go over the whole thing again. <br>Not that I was naturally inclined to be such a Moaning Minnie. It&#x2019;s just that this was the first time in my life I&#x2019;d ever suffered from unrequited love. Real unrequited love, I mean. The sort that genuinely hurts. Everything else retreated into the background. Even survival didn&#x2019;t seem to matter. Honestly, the thought of dying didn&#x2019;t seem so bad at that moment. I wouldn&#x2019;t be the first to die of a broken heart, after all&#x2014;I&#x2019;d be in good company. There was the Little Mermaid, Juliet, Pocahontas, the Lady of the Camellias, Madame Butterfly&#x2014;and now me, Gwyneth Shepherd. The good part of it was that I could leave out anything dramatic with a knife, as suggested by Lesley&#x2019;s remark, because the way I felt now, I must have caught TB ages ago, and dying of consumption is much the most picturesque way to go. I&#x2019;d lie on my bed looking pale and beautiful like Snow White, with my hair spread out on the pillow. Gideon would kneel beside me, feeling bitterly sorry for what he had done when I breathed my last words. <br>But first I had to go to the toilet, urgently. <br>Peppermint tea with masses of lemon and sugar was a cure for all ills in our family, and I must have drunk pints of it. Because when I came in yesterday evening, my mother had noticed right away that I wasn&#x2019;t feeling good. It wasn&#x2019;t difficult to spot that, because crying had made me look like an albino rabbit. And if I&#x2019;d told her&#x2014;as Xemerius suggested&#x2014;that I&#x2019;d had to chop onions in the limousine on the way home from the Guardians&#x2019; headquarters, she&#x2019;d never have believed my story. <br>&#x201c;Have those damn Guardians been doing something to you? What happened?&#x201d; she had asked, managing to sound sympathetic and furiously angry at the same time. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll murder Falk if&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No one&#x2019;s done anything to me, Mum,&#x201d; I&#x2019;d said quickly, to reassure her. &#x201c;And nothing has happened.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;As if she was going to believe that! Why didn&#x2019;t you try the onion excuse? You never take my good advice.&#x201d; Xemerius had stamped his clawed feet on the floor. He was a small stone gargoyle demon with big ears, bat&#x2019;s wings, a scaly tail like a dragon, and two little horns on a catlike head. Unfortunately he wasn&#x2019;t half as cute as he looked, and no one except me could hear his outrageous remarks and answer him back. There were two odd things about me, by the way, and I just had to live with them. One was that I&#x2019;d been able to see gargoyle demons and other ghosts and talk to them from early childhood. The other was even odder, and I hadn&#x2019;t known about it until under two weeks ago, when I found out that I was one of a strictly secret bunch of twelve time travelers, which meant going back to somewhere in the past for a couple of hours every day. The curse of time travel&#x2014;well, okay, so it was supposed to be a gift&#x2014;ought to have affected my cousin Charlotte, who&#x2019;d have been much better at it, but it turned out that I&#x2019;d drawn the short straw. No reason why I should be surprised. I was always left holding the last card when we played Old Maid; if we cast lots in class to see who bought Mrs. Counter&#x2019;s Christmas gift, I always got the piece of paper with her name on it (and how do you decide what to give a geography teacher?); if I had tickets for a concert, you could bet I&#x2019;d fall sick; and when I particularly wanted to look good, I got a zit on my forehead the size of a third eye. Some people may not understand right away how a zit is like time travel&#x2014;they may even envy me and think time travel would be fun, but it isn&#x2019;t. It&#x2019;s a nuisance, nerve-racking and dangerous as well. Not forgetting that if I hadn&#x2019;t inherited that stupid gift I&#x2019;d never have met Gideon and then my heart, whether or not it was made of marzipan, would still be just fine. Because that guy was another of the twelve time travelers. One of the few still alive. You couldn&#x2019;t meet the others except back in the past. <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been crying,&#x201d; my mother had said in a matter-of-fact way. <br>&#x201c;There, you see?&#x201d; Xemerius had said. &#x201c;Now she&#x2019;s going to squeeze you like a lemon until the pips squeak. She won&#x2019;t let you out of her sight for a second, and we can wave good-bye to tonight&#x2019;s treasure hunt.&#x201d; <br>I&#x2019;d made a face at him, to let him know that I didn&#x2019;t feel like treasure hunting tonight anymore. Well, you have to make faces at invisible friends if you don&#x2019;t want other people to think you&#x2019;re crazy because you talk to the empty air. <br>&#x201c;Tell her you were trying out the pepper spray,&#x201d; the empty air had answered me back, &#x201c;and it got into your own eyes by mistake.&#x201d; <br>But I&#x2019;d been far too tired to tell lies. I just looked at my mum with red-rimmed eyes and tried telling the truth. <i>Here goes, then</i>, I&#x2019;d thought. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just&nbsp;&#x2026; no, I don&#x2019;t feel too good. It&#x2019;s&nbsp;&#x2026; kind of a girl thing, you know?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Oh, darling.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;If I phone Lesley, I know I&#x2019;ll feel better.&#x201d; <br>Much to the surprise of Xemerius&#x2014;me too&#x2014;Mum had been satisfied with this explanation. She made me peppermint tea, left the teapot and my favorite cup with its pattern of spots on my bedside table, stroked my hair, and otherwise left me in peace. She didn&#x2019;t even keep reminding me of the time, as usual. (&#x201c;Gwyneth! It&#x2019;s after ten, and you&#x2019;ve been on the phone for forty minutes. You&#x2019;ll be seeing each other at school tomorrow.&#x201d;) Sometimes she really was the best mother in the world. <br>Sighing, I swung my legs over the edge of the bed and stumbled off to the bathroom. I felt a cold breath of air. <br>&#x201c;Xemerius? Are you there?&#x201d; I asked under my breath, and felt for the light switch. <br>&#x201c;That depends.&#x201d; Xemerius was dangling head down from the ceiling fixture in the corridor, blinking at the light. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m here so long as you don&#x2019;t turn back into a watering can.&#x201d; He raised his voice to a shrill, tearful pitch as he imitated me&#x2014;rather well, I&#x2019;m sorry to say. &#x201c; <i>And then he said, I have no idea what you&#x2019;re talking about, and then I said, yes or no, and then he said, yes, but do stop crying.&#x2026;</i>&#x201d; He sighed theatrically. &#x201c;Girls get on my nerves worse than any other kind of human being. Along with retired taxmen, saleswomen in hosiery departments, and presidents of community garden societies.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t guarantee anything,&#x201d; I whispered, so as not to wake the rest of my family up. &#x201c;We&#x2019;d better not mention You Know Who, or the indoor fountain will come back on again.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I was sick of the sound of his name anyway. Can we do something sensible for a change? Go treasure hunting, for instance?&#x201d; <br>Getting some sleep might have been sensible, but unfortunately I was wide awake now. &#x201c;Okay, we can start if you like. But first I have to get rid of all that tea.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; <br>I pointed to the bathroom door. <br>&#x201c;Oh, I see,&#x201d; said Xemerius. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll just wait here.&#x201d; <br>I looked better than I expected in the bathroom mirror. Unfortunately there wasn&#x2019;t a sign of galloping consumption. My eyelids were a little swollen&#x2014;that was all, as if I&#x2019;d been using pink eye shadow and put on too much. <br>&#x201c;Where were you all this time, Xemerius?&#x201d; I asked when I came out into the corridor again. &#x201c;Not by any chance ...</p><h2>Stalin&#39;s Apologist: Walter Duranty: The New York Times&#39;s Man in Moscow</h2><p>Short, unattractive, hobbling about Stalin's Moscow on a wooden leg, Walter Duranty was an unlikely candidate for the world's most famous foreign correspondent. Yet for almost twenty years his articles filled the front page of <em>The New York Times</em> with gripping coverage of the aftermath of the Russian Revolution. A witty, engaging, impish character with a flamboyant life-style, he was a Pulitzer Prize winner, the individual most credited with helping to win U.S. recognition for the Soviet regime, and the reporter who had predicted the success of the Bolshevik state when all others claimed it was doomed. But, as S.J. Taylor reveals in this provocative biography, Walter Duranty played a key role in perpetrating some of the greatest lies history has ever known.<br> <em>Stalin's Apologist</em> deftly unfolds the story of this accomplished but sordid and tragic life. Drawing on sources ranging from newspapers to private letters and journals to interviews with such figures as William Shirer and W. Averell Harriman, Taylor's vivid narrative unveils a figure driven by ambition, whose early success reporting on Bolshevik Russia--he was foremost in predicting Stalin's rise to power--established his international reputation, fed his overconfident contempt for his colleagues, and indeed led him to identify with the Soviet dictator. Thus during the great Ukrainian famine of the early 1930s, which Stalin engineered to crush millions of peasants who resisted his policies, Duranty dismissed other correspondents' reports of mass starvation and, though secretly aware of the full scale of the horror, effectively reinforced the official cover-up of one of history's greatest man-made disasters. Later, he took the rigged show trials of Stalin's Great Purges at face value, blithely accepting the guilt of the victims. He believed himself the leading expert on the Soviet Union, and his faith in his own insight drew him into a downward spiral of distortions and untruths, typified by his memorable excuse for Stalin's crimes, "You can't make an omelet without breaking eggs." <br> Taylor brilliantly captures the full range of Duranty's astonishing life, from his participation in the Satanic orgies of Aleister ("the Beast") Crowley, to his dramatic front-line reporting during World War I, to his epic womanizing and heavy drug and alcohol abuse. It is the bitter, ironic story of a man who had the rare opportunity to bring to light the suffering of the millions of Stalin's victims, but remained a prisoner of vanity, self-indulgence, and success.</p><p><br><em>About the Author:</em><br> <strong>S.J.

To his son, waiting patiently in the car while his father peddles beauty wares and quickies to lonely housewives in the south of England, Bunny is a hero, larger than life. But Bunny himself, haunted by what might be his wife&#x2019;s ghost, seems only dimly aware of his son&#x2019;s existence. </p><p>When his bizarre trip shades into a final reckoning, when he can no longer be sure what is real and what is not, Bunny finally begins to recognize the love he feels for his son. And he sees that the revenants of his world&#x2014;decrepit fathers, vengeful ghosts, jealous husbands and horned psychokillers&#x2014;are lurking in the shadows, waiting to exact their toll. </p><p>At turns dark and humane, <i>The Death of Bunny Munro</i> is a tender portrait of the relationship between a boy and his father, with all the wit and enigma that fans will recognize as Nick Cave&#x2019;s singular vision. </p></p><p><p>Nick Cave has been performing music for more than thirty years as the lead singer of the Birthday Party, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, and Grinderman. He has collaborated with Kylie Minogue, PJ Harvey, and many others. His first novel, <i>And the Ass Saw the Angel</i>, was published in 1989. Born in Australia, Cave now lives near Brighton, England. </p>The Death of Bunny Munro &nbsp;1 <p>I am damned, thinks Bunny Munro in a sudden moment of self-awareness reserved for those who are soon to die. He feels that somewhere down the line he has made a grave mistake, but this realisation passes in a dreadful heartbeat, and is gone &#x2013; leaving him in a room at the Grenville Hotel, in his underwear, with nothing but himself and his appetites. He closes his eyes and pictures a random vagina, then sits on the edge of the hotel bed and, in slow motion, leans back against the quilted headboard. He clamps the mobile phone under his chin and with his teeth breaks the seal on a miniature bottle of brandy. He empties the bottle down his throat, lobs it across the room, then shudders and gags and says into the phone, &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t worry, love, everything&#x2019;s going to be all right.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;I&#x2019;m scared, Bunny,&#x2019; says his wife, Libby.</p><p>&#x2018;What are you scared of? You got nothing to be scared of.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Everything, I&#x2019;m scared of everything,&#x2019; she says.</p><p>But Bunny realises that something has changed in his wife&#x2019;s voice, the soft cellos have gone and a high, rasping violin has been added, played by an escaped ape or something. He registers it but has yet to understand exactly what this means.</p><p>&#x2018;Don&#x2019;t talk like that. You know that gets you nowhere,&#x2019; says Bunny, and like an act of love he sucks deep on a Lambert &amp; Butler. It is in that instant that it hits him &#x2013; the baboon on the violin, the inconsolable downward spiral of her drift &#x2013; and he says, &#x2018;Fuck!&#x2019; and blows two furious tusks of smoke from his nostrils.</p><p>&#x2018;Are you off your Tegretol? Libby, tell me you&#x2019;ve been taking your Tegretol!&#x2019;</p><p>There is silence on the other end of the line, then a broken, faraway sob.</p><p>&#x2018;Your father called again. I don&#x2019;t know what to say to him. I don&#x2019;t know what he wants. He shouts at me. He raves,&#x2019; she says.</p><p>&#x2018;For Christ&#x2019;s sake, Libby, you know what the doctor said. If you don&#x2019;t take your Tegretol, you get depressed. As you well know, it&#x2019;s dangerous for you to get depressed. How many fucking times do we have to go through this?&#x2019;</p><p>The sob doubles on itself, then doubles again, till it becomes gentle, wretched crying and it reminds Bunny of their first night together &#x2013; Libby lying in his arms, in the throes of some inexplicable crying jag, in a down-at-heel hotel room in Eastbourne. He remembers her looking up at him and saying, &#x2018;I&#x2019;m sorry, I get a little emotional sometimes,&#x2019; or something like that, and Bunny pushes the heel of his hand into his crotch and squeezes, releasing a pulse of pleasure into his lower spine.</p><p>&#x2018;Just take the fucking Tegretol,&#x2019; he says, softening.</p><p>&#x2018;I&#x2019;m scared, Bun. There&#x2019;s this guy running around attacking women.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;What guy?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;He paints his face red and wears plastic devil&#x2019;s horns.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;What?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Up north. It&#x2019;s on the telly.&#x2019;</p><p>Bunny picks up the remote off the bedside table and with a series of parries and ripostes turns on the television set that sits on top of the mini-bar. With the mute button on, he moves through the channels till he finds some black-and-white CCTV footage taken at a shopping mall in Newcastle. A man, bare-chested and wearing tracksuit bottoms, weaves through a crowd of terrified shoppers. His mouth is open in a soundless scream. He appears to be wearing devil&#x2019;s horns and waves what looks like a big black stick.</p><p>Bunny curses under his breath and in that moment all energy, sexual or otherwise, deserts him. He thrusts the remote at the TV and in a fizz of static it goes out and Bunny lets his head loll back. He focuses on a water stain on the ceiling shaped like a small bell or a woman&#x2019;s breast.</p><p>Somewhere in the outer reaches of his consciousness he becomes aware of a manic twittering sound, a tinnitus of enraged protest, electronic sounding and horrible, but Bunny does not recognise this, rather he hears his wife say, &#x2018;Bunny? Are you there?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Libby. Where are you?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;In bed.&#x2019;</p><p>Bunny looks at his watch, trombones his hand, but cannot focus.</p><p>&#x2018;For Christ&#x2019;s sake. Where is Bunny Junior?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;In his room, I guess.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Look, Libby, if my dad calls again .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;He carries a trident,&#x2019; says his wife.</p><p>&#x2018;What?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;A garden fork.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;What? Who?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;The guy, up north.&#x2019;</p><p>Bunny realises then that the screaming, cheeping sound is coming from outside. He hears it now above the bombination of the air conditioner and it is sufficiently apocalyptic to almost arouse his curiosity. But not quite.</p><p>The watermark on the ceiling is growing, changing shape &#x2013; a bigger breast, a buttock, a sexy female knee &#x2013; and a droplet forms, elongates and trembles, detaches itself from the ceiling, freefalls and explodes on Bunny&#x2019;s chest. Bunny pats at it as if he were in a dream and says, &#x2018;Libby, baby, where do we live?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Brighton.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;And where is Brighton?&#x2019; he says, running a finger along the row of miniature bottles of liquor arranged on the bedside table and choosing a Smirnoff.</p><p>&#x2018;Down south.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Which is about as far away from &#x201c;up north&#x201d; as you can get without falling into the bloody sea. Now, sweetie, turn off the TV, take your Tegretol, take a sleeping tablet &#x2013; shit, take two sleeping tablets &#x2013; and I&#x2019;ll be back tomorrow. Early.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;The pier is burning down,&#x2019; says Libby.</p><p>&#x2018;What?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;The West Pier, it&#x2019;s burning down. I can smell the smoke from here.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;The West Pier?&#x2019;</p><p>Bunny empties the tiny bottle of vodka down his throat, lights another cigarette and rises from the bed. The room heaves as Bunny is hit by the realisation that he is very drunk. With arms held out to the side and on tiptoe, Bunny moonwalks across the room to the window. He lurches, stumbles and Tarzans the faded chintz curtains until he finds his balance and steadies himself. He draws them open extravagantly and vulcanised daylight and the screaming of birds deranges the room. Bunny&#x2019;s pupils contract painfully as he grimaces through the window, into the light. He sees a dark cloud of starlings, twittering madly over the flaming, smoking hulk of the West Pier which stands, helpless, in the sea across from the hotel. He wonders why he hadn&#x2019;t seen this before and then wonders how long he has been in this room, then remembers his wife and hears her say, &#x2018;Bunny, are you there?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Yeah,&#x2019; says Bunny, transfixed by the sight of the burning pier and the thousand screaming birds.</p><p>&#x2018;The starlings have gone mad. It&#x2019;s such a horrible thing. Their little babies burning in their nests. I can&#x2019;t bear it, Bun,&#x2019; says Libby, the high violin rising.</p><p>Bunny moves back to the bed and can hear his wife crying on the end of the phone. Ten years, he thinks, ten years and those tears still get him &#x2013; those turquoise eyes, that joyful pussy, ah man, and that unfathomable sob stuff &#x2013; and he lies back against the headboard and bats, ape-like, at his genitals and says, &#x2018;I&#x2019;ll be back tomorrow, babe, early.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Do you love me, Bun?&#x2019; says Libby.</p><p>&#x2018;You know I do.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Do you swear on your life?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Upon Christ and all his saints. Right down to your little shoes, baby.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Can&#x2019;t you get home tonight?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;I would if I could,&#x2019; says Bunny, groping around on the bed for his cigarettes, &#x2018;but I&#x2019;m miles away.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Oh, Bunny .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you fucking liar .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x2019;</p><p>The line goes dead and Bunny says, &#x2018;Libby? Lib?&#x2019;</p><p>He looks inexplicably at the phone as if he has just discovered he is holding it, then clamshells it shut as another droplet of water explodes on his chest. Bunny forms a little &#x2018;O&#x2019; with his mouth and he shoves a cigarette in it. He torches it with his Zippo and pulls deeply, then emits a considered stream of grey smoke.</p><p>&#x2018;You got your hands full there, darling.&#x2019;</p><p>With great effort Bunny turns his head and looks at the prostitute standing in the bathroom doorway. Her fluorescent pink knickers pulse against her chocolate-coloured skin. She scratches at her cornrows and a slice of orange flesh peeps behind her drug-slack lower lip. Bunny thinks that her nipples look like the triggers on those mines they floated in the sea to blow up ships in the war or something, and almost tells her this, but forgets and draws on his cigarette again and says, &#x2018;That was my wife. She suffers from depression.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;She&#x2019;s not alone there, sweetheart,&#x2019; she says as she jitters across the faded Axminster carpet, the shocking tip of her tongue protruding pinkly from between her lips. She drops to her knees and takes Bunny&#x2019;s cock in her mouth.</p><p>&#x2018;No, it&#x2019;s a medical condition. She&#x2019;s on medication.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Her and me both, darling,&#x2019; says the girl, across Bunny&#x2019;s stomach.</p><p>Bunny seems to give this reply due consideration as he manoeuvres his hips. A limp black hand rests on his belly, and looking down Bunny sees that each fingernail has the detailed representation of a tropical sunset painted on it.</p><p>&#x2018;Sometimes it gets really bad,&#x2019; he says.</p><p>&#x2018;That&#x2019;s why they call it the blues, baby,&#x2019; she says, but Bunny barely hears this as her voice comes out in a low, incomprehensible croak. The hand twitches and then jumps on his stomach.</p><p>&#x2018;Hey? What?&#x2019; he says, sucking air through his teeth, and he gasps suddenly and there it was, blowing up from his heart, that end-of-things thought again &#x2013; &#x2018;I am damned&#x2019; &#x2013; and he folds an arm across his eyes and arches slightly.</p><p>&#x2018;Are you OK, darling?&#x2019; says the prostitute.</p><p>&#x2018;I think a bath is overflowing upstairs,&#x2019; says Bunny.</p><p>&#x2018;Hush now, baby.&#x2019;</p><p>The girl lifts her head and looks fleetingly at Bunny, and he tries to find the centre of her black eyes, the tell-tale pinprick of her pupils, but his gaze loses its intent and blurs. He places a hand on her head, feels the damp sheen on the back of her neck.</p><p>&#x2018;Hush now, baby,&#x2019; she says again.</p><p>&#x2018;Call me Bunny,&#x2019; he says and sees another droplet of water tremble on the ceiling.</p><p>&#x2018;I&#x2019;ll call you any damn thing you want, sweetie.&#x2019;</p><p>Bunny closes his eyes and presses on the coarse ropes of her hair. He feels the soft explosion of water on his chest, like a sob.</p><p>&#x2018;No, call me Bunny,&#x2019; he whispers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Copyright � 2009 by Nick Cave</p><p>All rights reserved</p><p>Originally published in 2009 by the Text Publishing Company, Australia</p><p>Published in the United States by Faber and Faber, Inc.</p><p>First American edition, 2009</p></p><h2>The Other Side of Ethel Mertz: The Life Story of Vivian Vance</h2><p>Details the actress&#39; early days in theater and her often stormy relationship with Lucille Ball</p><p>Which name is more familiar to you, Ethel Mertz or Vivian Vance? Chances are, like most of America, you think you know Lucy's feisty sidekick Ethel; but the actress Vivian Vance, who backed Lucille Ball so successfully in the comedy series <i>I Love Lucy</i> had an exciting life and career long before Desi Arnaz chose her, against Lucy's wishes, to play Ethel. <p>Here are little known facts and stories not only about the stormy relationship of Lucy and Ethel, but wonderfully funny vignettes about Vivian Vance's early life on the stage - performing with such legends as Jimmy Durante, Ethel Merman, Bob Hope, Ed Wynn and Gypsy Rose Lee. </p><p>Given the popularity and fame Vivian Vance achieved in her life, it's strange that no biography of this gifted actress appeared before now. Yet, it's perhaps not so strange after all. This lovely, vibrant woman was adept at hiding the unhappy parts of her life or the facts that did not fit the image she painstakingly constructed for herself over the years. </p><p>At the time she was considered one of the most adept comic actresses of her time, bringing happiness to millions each week Vivian Vance fought a frightening personal battle with depression. Her story -- the story of a woman who overcame family problems, marital problems and a host of professional problems to help create a television classic -- is told with gusto and with nothing held back in <i>The Other Side of Ethel Mertz: the Life Story of Vivian Vance</i>. </p><p>Authors Frank Castelluccio and Alvin Walker have done their homework, and trace brilliantly and sympathetically the development of a woman who turned adversity into strength all her life. </p><p>Thoroughly researched and authenticated, <i>The Other Side of Ethel Mertz</i> tells the remarkable tale of this feisty and talented woman.</p>Frank Castelluccio came to the US from Italy, graduated from NYU and is a member of the Screen Actor's Guild and American Federation of Television &amp; Radio Artists. He lives in Los Angeles. <p>Alvin Walker grew up in Memphis, TN, he has had a long career in acting and has appeared in several films, television series, off-Broadway, Regional, and touring productions.

In any case, the story is so well-paced that it&#x2019;s preferable to just put your feet up and go along for the ride than to try and second-guess the author. <i>Pushing Ice</i> is a brilliant read and demonstrates that Reynolds is continuing to travel from strength to strength.

The faint possibility of failure had always been at the back of her mind, but now that her ship had actually delivered her to the Congressional capital world, now that she had actually frameshifted to New Far Florence across all those dizzying light-years, the faint possibility had sharpened into a stomach-churning conviction that she was about to suffer imminent and chastening defeat. There had always been people eager to tell her that her proposal was doomed, but for the first time it occurred to her that they could be right. What she had in mind was, even by her own admission, a deeply unorthodox suggestion.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, it&#x2019;s certainly a nice day for it,&#x201d; said Rudd Indigo Mammatus, joining her on the balcony, high above the cloud-girdled tiers and gardens of the Congress building&#x2019;s footslopes.</p><p>&#x201c;Abject humiliation, you mean?&#x201d;</p><p>Rudd shook his head good-naturedly. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the last perfect day of summer. I&#x2019;ve checked: tomorrow will be cooler, stormier. Doesn&#x2019;t that strike you as suitably auspicious?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m worried. I think I&#x2019;m going to make an idiot of myself in there.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve all made idiots of ourselves at some point. In this line of work it&#x2019;s almost obligatory.&#x201d;</p><p>Chromis and Rudd were politicians, political friends from different constituencies of the Congress of the Lindblad Ring. Chromis spoke for a relatively small grouping of settled worlds: a mere one hundred and thirty planet-class entities, packed into a volume of space only twenty light-years across. Rudd&#x2019;s constituency, located on the edge of the Ring&#x2014;where it brushed against the fractious outer worlds of the Loop II Imperium&#x2014;enveloped a much larger volume of space but only a third as many planet-class entities. Politically, they had very little in common, but by the same token they had very little worth squabbling over. Once every five hundred years, when the representatives were summoned to New Far Florence, Chromis and Rudd would meet to swap world-weary tales of scandal and chicanery from their respective constituencies.</p><p>Chromis fingered the ring on her right index finger, tracing the interlocking, hypnotically complex design embossed into its surface. &#x201c;Do you think they&#x2019;ll go for it? It&#x2019;s been eighteen thousand years, after all. It&#x2019;s asking a lot of people to think back that far.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The whole point of this little exercise is to dream up something to commemorate ten thousand years of our glorious Congress,&#x201d; Rudd said, with only the slightest trace of irony. &#x201c;If the other representatives can&#x2019;t get off their fat backsides and think back another eight thousand years before that, they deserve to have the reeves set on them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t joke,&#x201d; Chromis said darkly. &#x201c;I heard they had to send in the reeves on Hemlock only four hundred years ago.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Messy business, too: by all accounts there were at least a dozen non-recoverable dead. But I wasn&#x2019;t joking, Chromis: if they don&#x2019;t bite, I&#x2019;ll personally recommend a police action.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If only everyone else felt the same way.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then damn well go in there and see to it that they do.&#x201d; Rudd offered his hand. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s time, anyway. The last thing you want to do is keep any of them waiting.&#x201d;</p><p>She took his hand chastely. Rudd was an attractive man, and Chromis had it on good authority that she had many admirers in the Congress, but their friendship was strictly platonic: they both had partners back on their home-worlds, held in stasis cauls until they returned from New Far Florence. Chromis loved her husband, although many days might pass between thoughts of him. Without his help convincing one hundred and thirty worlds that this was something they had to support, the memorial plan would have stalled long ago.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m really worried, Rudd. Worried I&#x2019;m about to screw up nearly a thousand years of preparation.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Keep your nerve and stick to the script,&#x201d; Rudd said sternly. &#x201c;No last-minute clever ideas, all right?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Same goes for you. Remember: &#x2018;intended recipient&#x2019;.&#x201d;</p><p>Rudd smiled reassuringly and led her into the stratospheric vastness of the meeting room. The chamber had been constructed in the early centuries of the Congress, when it had aspirations to expand into territory now occupied by neighbouring polities. Space not being at a premium on New Far Florence, the hundred-odd representatives were scattered across nearly a square kilometre of gently sloping floor space, and the ceiling was ten kilometres above their heads. Slowly rotating in the middle of the room, lacking any material suspension, was the display cube in which their enlarged images would appear when they had the floor. While it waited for the session to begin, the cube projected the ancient emblem of the Congress: a three-dimensional rendering of Leonardo da Vinci&#x2019;s drawing of a naked man encompassed within a square and circle, his limbs drawn twice so that he stood upon, and touched, both shapes.</p><p>Chromis and Rudd took their positions on either side of the floor. The last few delegates were arriving by transit caul: black humanoid shells popped into existence in the chamber before dissipating to reveal the occupants within. The femtomachinery of the cauls merged seamlessly with the local machinery of the Congress building. Every artificial object in the Congress of the Lindblad Ring&#x2014;from the largest frameshift liner to the smallest medical robot&#x2014;comprised countless copies of the same universal femtomachine element.</p><p>Routine business consumed the first hour of the meeting. Chromis sat patiently, shuffling mental permutations, wondering whether she should consider a change of approach. It was difficult to judge the mood of the gathering. But Rudd&#x2019;s advice had been sound. She held her nerve, and when she had the floor she spoke the words she had already committed to memory before leaving home.</p><p>&#x201c;Honoured delegates,&#x201d; she began, as her magnified image appeared in the display cube, &#x201c;we are nearing the ten thousandth year since the founding of our first colony&#x2014;the beginning of what we now recognise as the Congress of the Lindblad Ring. I believe we are all of a mind in one respect: something must be done to acknowledge this coming milestone, something that will reflect well upon our administration, especially in light of the similar anniversaries that have recently been celebrated in two of our neighbouring polities. There have been many suggestions as to how we might mark this occasion. A civic project, perhaps, such as a well-deserved terraforming or a timely stellar rejuvenation. A Dyson englobement&#x2014;purely for the hell of it&#x2014;or the frame-shifting of an entire world from one system to another. Even something as modest as the erection of a ceremonial dome or an ornamental fountain.&#x201d; Chromis paused and looked pointedly at the delegates who had proposed these latter projects, hoping that they felt suitably abashed at their dismal lack of vision.</p><p>&#x201c;There have been many excellent proposals, and doubtless there will be many more, but I wish to suggest something of an entirely different magnitude. Rather than creating something for ourselves, a monument in our own galactic backyard, I humbly suggest that we consider something altogether more altruistic. I propose an audacious act of cosmic gratitude: the sending of a message, a gift, across space and time. The intended recipient of this gift will be the person&#x2014;or the descendants of the person&#x2014;without whom the very fabric of our society would look unrecognisably different.&#x201d;</p><p>Chromis paused again, still unable to judge the mood of the delegates, the blank faces of those close enough to see conveying neither approval nor disapproval. She took a deep breath and pressed on. &#x201c;Doubtless we would have achieved some of the same advances eventually&#x2014;but who is to say that it wouldn&#x2019;t have taken tens of thousands of years rather than the mere handful of millennia it actually took? Instead of a mosaic of polities spread across nearly twelve thousand light-years of the galactic disc, we might very well be confined to a handful of systems, with all the risks that such close confinement would inevitably entail. And let us not forget that the insights that have allowed us to leapfrog centuries of slow development were given to us freely, with no expectation of reward. Our Benefactor sent that data back to Earth because it was the right thing to do.&#x201d; Here Chromis swallowed, uncomfortably aware that some might be thinking&#x2014;not without cause&#x2014;that the very same data had almost wiped out humanity as it struggled to assimilate dangerous new knowledge. But at a remove of eighteen thousand years, such thoughts were surely churlish. Fire had singed more than a few fingers before people learned how to use it.</p><p>She heard a few unconvinced grumbles, but no one chose to interrupt her. Chromis steeled herself and continued, &#x201c;I know that some of us have forgotten the precise nature of that act of charity. In a moment, I hope to jog our collective memory. But first let me outline exactly what I have in mind.&#x201d;</p><p>She craned her neck to look at the display cube. On cue, her image was replaced by a simulation of the galaxy, as if viewed from far outside: ancient and huge, littered with the humbling relics of the Spicans but empty of life&#x2014;so far as anyone knew&#x2014;save for the smudge of human presence spreading out from one spiral arm, like an inkblot.</p><p>&#x201c;The Benefactor and her people are still out there somewhere,&#x201d; Chromis said, &#x201c;almost certainly beyond the Hard Data Frontier&#x2014;perhaps even outside the galaxy itself. But unless the universe has more tricks up its sleeve than we suspect, they can&#x2019;t be more than eighteen thousand light-years away, even if they&#x2019;re still moving away from us. And perhaps they&#x2019;ve already arrived wherever...</p></p><h2>Bellman &amp; Black: A Novel</h2><p><b>#1 <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author</b><br> <br><b>&#x201c;An astonishing work of genius.&#x201d;&#x2014;Bookreporter.com</b><br> <br><b>&#x201c;Magically transformative.&#x201d;&#x2014;Bookpage</b><br> <br><b>Can one moment in time haunt you forever?</b><br> <br><b>From the instant #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Thirteenth Tale </i>comes a &#x201c;poetic and mysterious&#x201d; (<i>Booklist</i>) story that will haunt you to your very core.</b><br><br>Caught up in a moment of boyhood competition, William Bellman recklessly aims his slingshot at a rook resting on a branch, killing the bird instantly.

She lives in Oxford, England.Bellman &amp; Black THE LETTER<p></p> <br><br> <br>It was November. Although it was not yet late, the sky was dark when I turned into Laundress Passage. Father had finished for the day, switched off the shop lights and closed the shutters; but so I would not come home to darkness he had left on the light over the stairs to the flat. Through the glass in the door it cast a foolscap rectangle of paleness onto the wet pavement, and it was while I was standing in that rectangle, about to turn my key in the door, that I first saw the letter. Another white rectangle, it was on the fifth step from the bottom, where I couldn&#x2019;t miss it.<br> <br>I closed the door and put the shop key in its usual place behind Bailey&#x2019;s Advanced Principles of Geometry. Poor Bailey. No one has wanted his fat gray book for thirty years. Sometimes I wonder what he makes of his role as guardian of the bookshop keys. I don&#x2019;t suppose it&#x2019;s the destiny he had in mind for the masterwork that he spent two decades writing.<br> <br>A letter. For me. That was something of an event. The crisp-cornered envelope, puffed up with its thickly folded contents, was addressed in a hand that must have given the postman a certain amount of trouble. Although the style of the writing was old-fashioned, with its heavily embellished capitals and curly flourishes, my first impression was that it had been written by a child. The letters seemed untrained. Their uneven strokes either faded into nothing or were heavily etched into the paper. There was no sense of flow in the letters that spelled out my name. Each had been undertaken separately&#x2014;M A R G A R E T L E A&#x2014;as a new and daunting enterprise. But I knew no children. That is when I thought, It is the hand of an invalid.<br> <br>It gave me a queer feeling. Yesterday or the day before, while I had been going about my business, quietly and in private, some unknown person&#x2014;some stranger&#x2014;had gone to the trouble of marking my name onto this envelope. Who was it who had had his mind&#x2019;s eye on me while I hadn&#x2019;t suspected a thing?<br> <br>Still in my coat and hat, I sank onto the stair to read the letter. (I never read without making sure I am in a secure position. I have been like this ever since the age of seven when, sitting on a high wall and reading The Water Babies, I was so seduced by the descriptions of underwater life that I unconsciously relaxed my muscles. Instead of being held buoyant by the water that so vividly surrounded me in my mind, I plummeted to the ground and knocked myself out. I can still feel the scar under my fringe now. Reading can be dangerous.)<br> <br>I opened the letter and pulled out a sheaf of half a dozen pages, all written in the same laborious script. Thanks to my work, I am experienced in the reading of difficult manuscripts. There is no great secret to it. Patience and practice are all that is required. That and the willingness to cultivate an inner eye. When you read a manuscript that has been damaged by water, fire, light or just the passing of the years, your eye needs to study not just the shape of the letters but other marks of production. The speed of the pen. The pressure of the hand on the page. Breaks and releases in the flow. You must relax. Think of nothing. Until you wake into a dream where you are at once a pen flying over vellum and the vellum itself with the touch of ink tickling your surface. Then you can read it. The intention of the writer, his thoughts, his hesitations, his longings and his meaning. You can read as clearly as if you were the very candlelight illuminating the page as the pen speeds over it.<br> <br>Not that this letter was anything like as challenging as some. It began with a curt &#x201c;Miss Lea&#x201d;; thereafter the hieroglyphs resolved themselves quickly into characters, then words, then sentences.<br> <br>This is what I read:<br> <br>I once did an interview for the Banbury Herald. I must look it out one of these days, for the biography. Strange chap they sent me. A boy, really. As tall as a man, but with the puppy fat of youth. Awkward in his new suit. The suit was brown and ugly and meant for a much older man. The collar, the cut, the fabric, all wrong. It was the kind of thing a mother might buy for a boy leaving school for his first job, imagining that her child will somehow grow into it. But boys do not leave their boyhood behind when they leave off their school uniform.<br> <br>There was something in his manner. An intensity. The moment I set eyes on him, I thought, &#x201c;Aha, what&#x2019;s he after?&#x201d;<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve nothing against people who love truth. Apart from the fact that they make dull companions. Just so long as they don&#x2019;t start on about storytelling and honesty, the way some of them do. Naturally that annoys me. But provided they leave me alone, I won&#x2019;t hurt them.<br> <br>My gripe is not with lovers of the truth but with truth herself. What succor, what consolation is there in truth, compared to a story? What good is truth, at midnight, in the dark, when the wind is roaring like a bear in the chimney? When the lightning strikes shadows on the bedroom wall and the rain taps at the window with its long fingernails? No. When fear and cold make a statue of you in your bed, don&#x2019;t expect hard-boned and fleshless truth to come running to your aid. What you need are the plump comforts of a story. The soothing, rocking safety of a lie.<br> <br>Some writers don&#x2019;t like interviews of course. They get cross about it. &#x201c;Same old questions,&#x201d; they complain. Well, what do they expect? Reporters are hacks. We writers are the real thing. Just because they always ask the same questions, it doesn&#x2019;t mean we have to give them the same old answers, does it? I mean, making things up, it&#x2019;s what we do for a living. So I give dozens of interviews a year. Hundreds over the course of a lifetime. For I have never believed that genius needs to be locked away out of sight to thrive. My genius is not so frail a thing that it cowers from the dirty fingers of the newspapermen.<br> <br>In the early years they used to try to catch me out. They would do research, come along with a little piece of truth concealed in their pocket, draw it out at an opportune moment and hope to startle me into revealing more. I had to be careful. Inch them in the direction I wanted them to take, use my bait to draw them gently, imperceptibly, toward a prettier story than the one they had their eye on. A delicate operation. Their eyes would start to shine, and their grasp on the little chip of truth would loosen, until it dropped from their hand and fell, disregarded, by the wayside. It never failed. A good story is always more dazzling than a broken piece of truth.<br> <br>Afterward, once I became famous, the Vida Winter interview became a sort of rite of passage for journalists. They knew roughly what to expect, would have been disappointed to leave without the story. A quick run through the normal questions (Where do you get your inspiration? Are your characters based on real people? How much of your main character is you?) and the shorter my answers the better they liked it. (Inside my head. No. None.) Then, the bit they were waiting for, the thing they had really come for. A dreamy, expectant look stole across their faces. They were like little children at bedtime. And you, Miss Winter, they said. Tell me about yourself.<br> <br>And I told. Simple little stories really, not much to them. Just a few strands, woven together in a pretty pattern, a memorable motif here, a couple of sequins there. Mere scraps from the bottom of my ragbag. Hundreds more where they came from. Offcuts from novels and stories, plots that never got finished, stillborn characters, picturesque locations I never found a use for. Odds and ends that fell out in the editing. Then it&#x2019;s just a matter of neatening the edges, stitching in the ends, and it&#x2019;s done. Another brand-new biography.<br> <br>They went away happy, clutching their notebooks in their paws like children with sweets at the end of a birthday party. It would be something to tell their grandchildren. &#x201c;One day I met Vida Winter, and she told me a story.&#x201d;<br> <br>Anyway, the boy from the Banbury Herald. He said, &#x201c;Miss Winter, tell me the truth.&#x201d; Now, what kind of appeal is that? I&#x2019;ve had people devise all kinds of stratagems to trick me into telling, and I can spot them a mile off, but that? Laughable. I mean, whatever did he expect?<br> <br>A good question. What did he expect? His eyes were glistening with an intent fever. He watched me so closely. Seeking. Probing. He was after something quite specific, I was sure of it. His forehead was damp with perspiration. Perhaps he was sickening for something. Tell me the truth, he said.<br> <br>I felt a strange sensation inside. Like the past coming to life. The watery stirring of a previous life turning in my belly, creating a tide that rose in my veins and sent cool wavelets to lap at my temples. The ghastly excitement of it. Tell me the truth.<br> <br>I considered his request. I turned it over in my mind, weighed up the likely consequences. He disturbed me, this boy, with his pale face and his burning eyes.<br> <br>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>An hour later he was gone. A faint, absentminded good-bye and no backward glance.<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t tell him the truth. How could I? I told him a story. An impoverished, malnourished little thing. No sparkle, no sequins, just a few dull and faded patches, roughly tacked together with the edges left frayed. The kind of story that looks like real life. Or what people imagine real life to be, which is something rather different. It&#x2019;s not easy for someone of my talent to produce a story like that.<br> <br>I watched him from the window. He shuffled away up the street, shoulders drooping, head bowed, each step a weary effort. All that energy, the charge, the verve, gone. I had killed it. Not that I take all the blame. He should have known better than to believe me.<br> <br>I never saw him again.<br> <br>That feeling I had, the current in my stomach, my temples, my fingertips&#x2014;it remained with me for quite a while. It rose and fell, with the memory of the boy&#x2019;s words. Tell me the truth. &#x201c;No,&#x201d; I said. Over and over again. &#x201c;No.&#x201d; But it wouldn&#x2019;t be still. It was a distraction. More than that, it was a danger. In the end I did a deal. &#x201c;Not yet.&#x201d; It sighed, it fidgeted, but eventually it fell quiet. So quiet that I as good as forgot about it.<br> <br>What a long time ago that was. Thirty years? Forty? More, perhaps. Time passes more quickly than you think.<br> <br>The boy has been on my mind lately. Tell me the truth. And lately I have felt again that strange inner stirring. There is something growing inside me, dividing and multiplying. I can feel it, in my stomach, round and hard, about the size of a grapefruit. It sucks the air out of my lungs and gnaws the marrow from my bones. The long dormancy has changed it. From being a meek and biddable thing, it has become a bully. It refuses all negotiation, blocks discussion, insists on its rights. It won&#x2019;t take no for an answer. The truth, it echoes, calling after the boy, watching his departing back. And then it turns to me, tightens its grip on my innards, gives a twist. We made a deal, remember?<br> <br>It is time.<br> <br>Come on Monday. I will send a car to meet you from the half past four arrival at Harrogate Station.<br> <br>Vida Winter<br> <br>How long did I sit on the stairs after reading the letter? I don&#x2019;t know. For I was spellbound. There is something about words. In expert hands, manipulated deftly, they take you prisoner. Wind themselves around your limbs like spider silk, and when you are so enthralled you cannot move, they pierce your skin, enter your blood, numb your thoughts. Inside you they work their magic. When I at last woke up to myself, I could only guess what had been going on in the darkness of my unconsciousness. What had the letter done to me?<br> <br>I knew very little about Vida Winter. I was aware naturally of the various epithets that usually came attached to her name: England&#x2019;s best-loved writer; our century&#x2019;s Dickens; the world&#x2019;s most famous living author; and so on. I knew of course that she was popular, though the figures, when I later researched them, still came as a surprise. Fifty-six books published in fifty-six years; they are translated into forty-nine languages; Miss Winter has been named twenty-seven times the most borrowed author from English libraries; nineteen feature films have been based on her novels. In terms of statistics, the most disputed question is this: Has she or has she not sold more books than the Bible? The difficulty comes less from working out how many books she has sold (an ever-changing figure in the millions) than in obtaining solid figures for the Bible&#x2014;whatever one thinks of the word of God, his sales data are notoriously unreliable. The figure that might have interested me the most, as I sat there at the bottom of the stairs, was twenty-two. This was the number of biographers who, for want of information, or lack of encouragement, or after inducements or threats from Miss Winter herself, had been persuaded to give up trying to discover the truth about her. But I knew none of this then. I knew only one statistic, and it was one that seemed relevant: How many books by Vida Winter had I, Margaret Lea, read? None.<br> <br>I shivered on the stairs, yawned and stretched. Returning to myself, I found that my thoughts had been rearranged in my absence. Two items in particular had been selected out of the unheeded detritus that is my memory and placed for my attention.<br> <br>The first was a little scene involving my father. A box of books we are unpacking from a private library clearance includes a number of Vida Winters. At the shop we don&#x2019;t deal in contemporary fiction. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take them to the charity shop in my lunch hour,&#x201d; I say, and leave them on the side of the desk. But before the morning is out, three of the four books are gone. Sold. One to a priest, one to a cartographer, one to a military historian. Our clients&#x2019; faces, with the customary outward paleness and inner glow of the book lover, seem to light up when they spot the rich colors of the paperback covers. After lunch, when we have finished the unpacking and the cataloging and the shelving and we have no customers, we sit reading as usual. It is late autumn, it is raining and the windows have misted up. In the background is the hiss of the gas heater; we hear the sound without hearing it for, side by side, together and miles apart, we are deep in our books.<br> <br>&#x201c;Shall I make tea?&#x201d; I ask, surfacing.<br> <br>No answer.<br> <br>I make tea all the same and put a cup next to him on the desk.<br> <br>An hour later the untouched tea is cold. I make a fresh pot and put another steaming cup beside him on the desk. He is oblivious to my every movement.<br> <br>Gently I tilt the volume in his hands so that I can see the cover. It is the fourth Vida Winter. I return the book to its original position and study my father&#x2019;s face. He cannot hear me. He cannot see me. He is in another world, and I am a ghost.<br> <br>That was the first memory.<br> <br>The second is an image. In three-quarter profile, carved massively out of light and shade, a face towers over the commuters who wait, stunted, beneath. It is only an advertising photograph pasted on a billboard in a railway station, but to my mind&#x2019;s eye it has the impassive grandeur of long-forgotten queens and deities carved into rock faces by ancient civilizations. To contemplate the exquisite arc of the eye; the broad, smooth sweep of the cheekbones; the impeccable line and proportions of the nose, is to marvel that the randomness of human variation can produce something so supernaturally perfect as this.

Orphaned at nine, he was brought up by an elderly aunt and educated by French tutors until he matriculated at Kazan University in 1844. In 1847, he gave up his studies and, after several aimless years, volunteered for military duty in the army, serving as a junior officer in the Crimean War before retiring in 1857. In 1862, Tolstoy married Sophie Behrs, a marriage that was to become, for him, bitterly unhappy. His diary, started in 1847, was used for self-study and self-criticism; it served as the source from which he drew much of the material that appeared not only in his great novels <b>War and Peace</b> (1869) and <b>Anna Karenina</b> (1877), but also in his shorter works. Seeking religious justification for his life, Tolstoy evolved a new Christianity based upon his own interpretation of the Gospels. Yasnaya Polyana became a mecca for his many converts At the age of eighty-two, while away from home, the writer suffered a break down in his health in Astapovo, Riazan, and he died there on November 20, 1910.</p><h2>The Ferguson Rifle: A Novel (Louis L&#39;Amour&#39;s Lost Treasures)</h2><p>It began with gold that had once belonged to Montezuma. Stolen and cached in a church in Mexico, it was recovered by two army officers who fled north for the French settlements. Along the way one stabbed the other to death. The remaining officer was eventually killed by Plains Indians, but he buried the treasure just before he died. <br><br> Now Ronan Chantry, a handful of trappers, and an Irish girl whose father was killed after telling her a few vague landmarks are searching for the lost treasure. But they are not alone. The girl&#x2019;s uncle, Rafen Falvey, wants it, too. Like Chantry, he is well educated, bold, and determined. Under different circumstances the two men might have been friends. But in all likelihood it wouldn&#x2019;t have made any difference. When it comes to gold, even friendship doesn&#x2019;t keep men from killing each other.</p><p>Stripped of all he values in life, Ronan Chantry takes up his prized Ferguson rifle and heads west -- into an unknown land and an uncertain future. For an educated man, Chantry is surprisingly tough. For a civilized man, he is unexpectedly dangerous. But even he can&#39;t know the true extent of his courage until he draws the fire of a man who will do anything -- kill anyone -- for the glitter of gold.Our foremost storyteller of the American West, <b>Louis L&#x2019;Amour </b>has thrilled a nation by chronicling the adventures of the brave men and woman who settled the frontier.

In his fervent self-defense, Galton argues that the state's heavy reliance on industry for all of its war needs means that every member of the British industrial economy is implicated in Britain's near-constant state of war. <br><br><i>Empire of Guns </i>uses the story of Galton and the gun trade, from Birmingham to the outermost edges of the British empire, to illuminate the nation's emergence as a global superpower, the roots of the state's role in economic development, and the origins of our era's debates about gun control and the "military-industrial complex" -- that thorny partnership of government, the economy, and the military. Through Satia's eyes, we acquire a radically new understanding of this critical historical moment and all that followed from it. <br><br>Sweeping in its scope and entirely original in its approach, <i>Empire of Guns</i> is a masterful new work of history -- a rigorous historical argument with a human story at its heart.</p><p>Priya Satia is a Professor of History at Stanford University. She is the author of <i>Spies in Arabia: The Great War and the Cultural Foundations of Britain's Covert Empire in the Middle East</i>, and her writing has appeared in Slate, the <i>Financial Times</i>, <i>The Nation</i>, and the Huffington Post, among other publications. She received a MSc in Development Studies (Economics) at the London School of Economics and a PhD in History at the University of California, Berkeley.

You could scratch your head for hours trying to come up with a solution - or you can open this new book, packed with ingenious ideas, and find the aid or device you need right away. The ideas range from simple jigs, marking aids and holding devices to more complex machining aids and specialist tools so that you can eliminate difficult procedures, speed up time-consuming and repetitive jobs, and remove costly material waste. You can even avoid purchasing high-priced special-purpose equipment by using tools you already own as you work with the easy-to-make aids for sawbench, lathe, drill (and more) included here. Robert Wearing, a professional furniture-maker and teacher, has dealt with just about every tricky situation that comes up in a workshop and shares the &#34;tricks of the trade&#34; of a lifetime in this fascinating compendium. You&#39;ll find 200 woodworking aids, tools and devices, each fully explained and illustrated with easy-to-follow line drawings in this valuable addition to any home or professional workbench,</p><p>Advanced amateur and professional wood-workers should be delighted with the 203 projects suggested here for making a job easier or solving a specific problem. Beware, however: this is not a manual for beginners. Furniture-maker and teacher Wearing offers no introductory text, nor does he state the purpose or function of any tool or procedure described. The first project is an "improved sawing board," the last "a carcase cramping system." In between come a dovetail marking system, a combined "grasshopper" and deep gauge, a wooden jack plane and a method of diametric drilling of cylinders, to name a few. The instructions are clear and detailed, and the accompanying drawings and diagrams are easily understood.

That is, in many cases cycle irregularities can be either eliminated or alleviated simply through better nutrition or body balance. Originally written to help make the practice of Natural Family Planning easier for couples experiencing irregular cycles, this book has proven to be invaluable for anyone looking for improved fertility. <p> In this completely updated and expanded edition, Shannon first provides practical guidelines for selecting nutritious food, the highest priority for maintaining good health. Next, she systematically explains a host of reproductive problems and identifies the specific nutrition and targeted supplementation that research shows can be used as self-care to overcome such problems or improve fertility.</p>Marilyn McCusker Shannon holds a master s degree in human physiology with a minor in biochemistry from Indiana University s Medical Sciences Program. She is a tenured, part time instructor of biology at Indiana University Purdue University at Fort Wayne, Indiana, where she has taught human anatomy and physiology for the last 25 years.<br><br>Marilyn and her husband Ron have been a Teaching Couple for the Couple to Couple League for Natural Family Planning (NFP) since 1982. Her interest in the impact of nutrition on reproductive health is an outgrowth of her educational background and her experience as an NFP instructor. She has written many articles on nutrition and fertility for the Couple to Couple League's magazine, Family Foundations, and has spoken widely on this topic. She was awarded the Couple to Couple League's Edward M. Keefe, M.D. Award for the Scientific Advancement of Natural Family Planning following the first edition of Fertility, Cycles &amp; Nutrition.</p><h2>Glad Monster Sad Monster: A Book About Feelings</h2><p>Amazing condition</p><p></p><h2>Eleven on Top</h2><p><p>#1 <i>New York Times</i><br><br>#1 <i>Wall Street Journal</i><br><br>#1 <i>Los Angeles Times</i><br><br>#1 <i>Entertainment Weekly</i><br><br>#1 <i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p><br>Stephanie Plum is thinking her career as a fugitive apprehension agent has run its course.

She wants something safe and normal. As it turns out, jobs that are safe and normal for most people aren't necessarily safe and normal for Stephanie Plum. Trouble follows her, and the kind of trouble she had at the bail bonds office can't compare to the kind of trouble she finds herself facing now. Her past has come back to haunt her.

Most of them don't last a full working day, which is good for the reader, since it plunges Stephanie back into the always seedy, often dangerous, and always colorful world of fugitives who'd rather flee than face their day in court. She may be tired of having her life threatened, her cars torched or blown up, and her apartment broken into, but one thing she can say about her job is that it's never boring... and neither is she. Despite her intentions of going straight at a job with a little more security and a bit less excitement, an old client won't let her--he keeps leaving her threatening notes, stalking and scaring her, and making sure she needs the protection of the two men in her life--Joe Morelli, the sexy cop who's been bedding her since high school, and Ranger, the even sexier tough guy who can take down the meanest fugitive around but has a tender spot in his heart for the plucky Ms. Plum. All Evanovich fans' favorite characters people this sprightly caper novel, including Lula, the fast-food-chomping former hooker who's hot to take over Stephanie's job but really belongs in a WWE Takedown; Grandma Mazur, who'd rather go to a wake than a fancy-dress ball; Grandma Bella, the matriarch of the Morelli family whose evil eye frightens even the indomitable Stephanie; and Valerie, Stephanie's sister, who's about to embark on another trip to the altar.

Now, in <i>The Godfather Returns</i>, acclaimed novelist Mark Winegardner continues the story&#x2013;the years not covered in Puzo&#x2019;s bestselling book or in Francis Ford Coppola&#x2019;s classic films. <br><br>It is 1955. Michael Corleone has won a bloody victory in the war among New York&#x2019;s crime families. Now he wants to consolidate his power, save his marriage, and take his family into legitimate businesses. To do so, he must confront his most dangerous adversary yet, Nick Geraci, a former boxer who worked his way through law school as a Corleone street enforcer, and who is every bit as deadly and cunning as Michael. Their personal cold war will run from 1955 to 1962, exerting immense influence on the lives of America&#x2019;s most powerful criminals and their loved ones, including <br><br>Tom Hagen, the Corleone Family&#x2019;s lawyer and consigliere, who embarks on a political career in Nevada while trying to protect his brother;<br><br>Francesca Corleone, daughter of Michael&#x2019;s late brother Sonny, who is suddenly learning her family&#x2019;s true history and faces a difficult choice;<br><br>Don Louie Russo, head of the Chicago mob, who plays dumb but has wily ambitions for muscling in on the Corleones&#x2019; territory;<br><br>Peter Clemenza<b>,</b> the stalwart Corleone underboss, who knows more Family secrets than almost anyone;<br><br>Ambassador M. Corbett Shea, a former Prohibition-era bootlegger and business ally of the Corleones&#x2019;, who wants to get his son elected to the presidency&#x2013;and needs some help from his old friends;<br><br>Johnny Fontane, the world&#x2019;s greatest saloon singer, who ascends to new heights as a recording artist, cozying up to Washington&#x2019;s power elite and maintaining a precarious relationship with notorious underworld figures;<br><br>Kay Adams Corleone, who finally discovers the truth about her husband, Michael&#x2013;and must decide what it means for their marriage and their children and<br><br>Fredo Corleone, whose death has never been fully explained until now, and whose betrayal of the Family was part of a larger and more sinister chain of events.<br><br>Sweeping from New York and Washington to Las Vegas and Cuba, <i>The Godfather Returns </i>is the spellbinding story of America&#x2019;s criminal underworld at mid-century and its intersection with the political, legal, and entertainment empires. Mark Winegardner brings an original voice and vision to Mario Puzo&#x2019;s mythic characters while creating several equally unforgettable characters of his own. <i>The Godfather Returns </i>stands on its own as a triumph&#x2013;in a tale about what we love, yearn for, and sometimes have reason to fear . . . family.</p><p>MARK WINEGARDNER received a master of fine arts degree in fiction writing from George Mason University and published his first book at age twenty-six, while still in graduate school. His books have been chosen as among the best of the year by The New York Times Book Review, Chicago Sun-Times, Los Angeles Times, USA Today, and the New York Public Library.

He is now a professor and director of the creative writing program at Florida State University in Tallahassee, Florida.Chapter 1<br><br>ON A COLD spring Monday afternoon in 1955, Michael Corleone summoned Nick Geraci to meet him in Brooklyn. As the new Don entered his late father&#x2019;s house on Long Island to make the call, two men dressed like grease monkeys watched a television puppet show, waiting for Michael&#x2019;s betrayer to deliver him and marveling at the tits of the corn-fed blond puppeteer.<br><br>Michael, alone, walked into the raised corner room his late father had used as an office. He sat behind the little rolltop desk that had been Tom Hagen&#x2019;s. The <i>consigliere</i>&#x2019;s desk. Michael would have called from home&#x2013; Kay and the kids had left this morning to visit her folks in New Hampshire &#x2013;except that his phone was tapped. So was the other line in this house. He kept them that way to mislead listeners. But the inventive wiring that led to the phone in this office&#x2013;and the chain of bribes that protected it&#x2013;could have thwarted an army of cops. Michael dialed. He had no address book, just a knack for remembering numbers. The house was quiet. His mother was in Las Vegas with his sister, Connie, and her kids. On the second ring Geraci&#x2019;s wife answered. He barely knew her but greeted her by name (Charlotte) and asked about her daughters. Michael avoided the phone in general and had never before called Geraci at home. Ordinarily, orders were buffered, three men deep, to ensure that nothing could be traced to the Don. Charlotte gave quavering answers to Michael&#x2019;s polite questions and went to get her husband.<br><br>Nick Geraci had already put in a long day. Two heroin-bearing ships, neither of which was supposed to arrive from Sicily until next week, had shown up late last night, one in New Jersey, the other in Jacksonville. A lesser man would be in prison now, but Geraci had smoothed things over by hand-delivering a cash donation to the pension fund of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, whose men in Florida had performed like champs, and by paying a visit (and a sizable tribute) to the Stracci Family <i>capo </i>who controlled the docks in north Jersey. By five, Geraci was exhausted but home in his backyard in East Islip, playing horseshoes with his two girls. A two-volume history of Roman warfare he&#x2019;d just started reading sat next to the armchair in his den, in position for later that night. When the phone rang, Geraci was a few sips into his second Chivas and water. He had T-bones sizzling on his barbecue pit and a Dodgers/Phillies doubleheader on the radio. Charlotte, who&#x2019;d been in the kitchen assembling the rest of the meal, came out on the patio, carrying the phone with the long cord, her face drained of color.<br><br>&#x201c;Hello, Fausto.&#x201d; The only other person who called Nick Geraci by his given name was Vincent Forlenza, who&#x2019;d stood as Geraci&#x2019;s godfather in Cleveland. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like you to be a part of this thing Tessio arranged. Seven o&#x2019;clock at this place called Two Toms, do you know it?&#x201d;<br><br>The sky was blue and cloudless, but anyone watching Charlotte rush to herd the girls inside might have thought she&#x2019;d learned that a hurricane was bearing down on Long Island.<br><br>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; Geraci said. &#x201c;I eat there all the time.&#x201d; It was a test. He was either supposed to ask about <i>this thing Tessio arranged </i>or he wasn&#x2019;t. Geraci had always been good at tests. His gut feeling was to be honest. &#x201c;But I have no idea what you&#x2019;re talking about. What thing?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Some important people are coming from Staten Island to sort things out.&#x201d;<br><br><i>Staten Island </i>meant the Barzinis, who had that place sewn up. But if Tessio had set up peace talks with Michael and Don Barzini, why was Geraci hearing it from Michael and not Tessio? Geraci stared at the flames in his barbecue pit. Then it came to him what must have happened. He jerked his head and silently cursed.<br><br>Tessio was dead. Probably among many others.<br><br>The meeting place was the tip-off. Tessio loved that place. Which meant that most likely he&#x2019;d contacted Barzini himself and that either he or Barzini had set up a hit on Michael, which Michael had somehow anticipated.<br><br>Geraci poked the T-bones with a long steel spatula. &#x201c;You want me there for protection,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;or at the table or what?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That was a hell of a long pause.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sorry. Had to get some steaks off the grill here.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know what you&#x2019;re worried about, Fausto, but not why.&#x201d;<br><br>Did he mean Geraci had nothing to worry about? Or that he was trying to figure out what if any role Geraci had played in Tessio&#x2019;s betrayal? &#x201c;Well, pilgrim,&#x201d; Geraci answered, in his best John Wayne, &#x201c;I ain&#x2019;t so much worried as I am saddle sore and plum tuckered out.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Excuse me?&#x201d;<br><br>Geraci sighed. &#x201c;Even in the best of times I&#x2019;m a worrier.&#x201d; He felt a tide of gallows humor rise in him, though he spoke flatly: &#x201c;So shoot me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s why you&#x2019;re so good,&#x201d; Michael said. &#x201c;The worrying. It&#x2019;s why I like you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then you&#x2019;ll forgive me if I point out the obvious,&#x201d; Geraci said, &#x201c;and tell you to take a route there you&#x2019;d never ordinarily take. And also to avoid Flatbush.&#x201d;<br><br>Now it was Michael&#x2019;s turn for a long pause. &#x201c;Flatbush, huh? How do you figure that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Bums&#x2019;re home.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; Michael said.<br><br>&#x201c;The Dodgers. Second game of a twin bill with Philadelphia.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Right,&#x201d; Michael said.<br><br>Geraci lit a cigarette. &#x201c;Not a baseball fan, eh?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Used to be.&#x201d;<br><br>Geraci wasn&#x2019;t surprised. Seeing the business side of gambling ruined sports for a lot of the smarter guys. &#x201c;This could be the Bums&#x2019; year,&#x201d; Geraci said.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I keep hearing,&#x201d; Michael said. &#x201c;And of course you&#x2019;re forgiven.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;For what?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;For pointing out the obvious.&#x201d;<br><br>Geraci lifted the steaks off the grill and onto a platter. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a gift I have,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>An hour later, Geraci arrived at Two Toms with four of his men and positioned them outside. He took a seat alone and sipped an espresso. He wasn&#x2019;t afraid. Michael Corleone, unlike his brothers&#x2013;the brutish Sonny and the pathetic Fredo&#x2013;had inherited the old man&#x2019;s deliberate nature. He wouldn&#x2019;t order a hit on a hunch. He&#x2019;d make sure, no matter how long it took. Whatever test was coming, however galling it was to be tested by the likes of Michael Corleone, Nick Geraci would respond with honor. He was confident he&#x2019;d emerge unscathed.<br><br>Though he&#x2019;d never heard Salvatore Tessio say a bad word about Michael, Geraci didn&#x2019;t doubt that Sally had thrown in with Barzini. He <i>had </i>to be angry about the nepotism that made a Don out of a greenhorn like Michael. He <i>had </i>to see the folly of cutting the organization off from its neighborhood roots to move west and become&#x2013;what? Geraci had taken over countless once-thriving neighborhood businesses built by industrious, illiterate immigrant fathers and ruined by American-born sons with business degrees and dreams of expansion.<br><br>Geraci checked his watch, a college graduation gift from Tessio. Michael certainly hadn&#x2019;t inherited the late Don&#x2019;s legendary punctuality. Geraci ordered a second espresso.<br><br>Time and time again, Geraci had proven himself a loyal member of the Corleone organization and, still shy of his fortieth birthday, maybe its best earner. Once he&#x2019;d been a boxer, a heavyweight, both as Ace Geraci (a boy- hood nickname that he let stick, even though it mocked him for acceding to the American pronunciation of his name: <i>Juh-RAY-see </i>instead of <i>Jair- AH-chee</i>) and under numerous aliases (he was Sicilian but fair-haired, able to pass as Irish or German). He&#x2019;d kept his feet for six rounds against a man who, a few years later, knocked the heavyweight champion of the world on his ass. But Geraci had hung around gyms since he was a little kid. He&#x2019;d vowed never to become one of those punch-drunk geezers shuffling around smelling of camphor and clutching a little bag of yesterday&#x2019;s doughnuts. He fought for money, not glory. His godfather in Cleveland (who was also, Geraci gradually learned, <i>the </i>Godfather of Cleveland) had connected him with Tessio, who ran the biggest sports gambling operation in New York. Fixed fights meant fewer blows to the head. Soon Geraci was called on to give out back-alley beatings (beginning with two kids who&#x2019;d assaulted the daughter of Amerigo Bonasera, an undertaker friendly with Vito Corleone). The beatings punished deadbeats and loudmouths who had it coming, and earned Geraci enough money to go to college. Before he was twenty-five, he&#x2019;d finished his degree, left the enforcer racket, and was a rising man of promise in Tessio&#x2019;s <i>regime. </i>He&#x2019;d started out with some dubious qualities&#x2013;he was the only guy hanging out at the Patrick Henry Social Club who hadn&#x2019;t been born in Brooklyn or Sicily; the only one with a college degree; one of the few who didn&#x2019;t want to carry guns or visit whores&#x2013;but the best way to get ahead was to make money for the people above him, and Geraci was such a gifted earner that soon his exotic flaws were forgotten. His most brilliant tactic was to exaggerate his take on every job. He handed over sixty or seventy percent of everything instead of the required fifty. Even if he <i>had </i>been caught, what were they going to do, whack him? It was foolproof. His overpayments were an investment with jackpot-level payouts. The more he made for the men above him, the safer he was and the faster he rose.

All six volumes are highly practical and easy to use; together they form a cornerstone woodworking library.</p><p><i>Fine Woodworking </i>has been publishing the best woodworking information for small shop woodworkers since 1975.These titles, part of Taunton's new six-volume "Essentials of Woodworking" series, consist of articles that originally appeared in Fine Woodworking magazine during the last six years. (Other titles in this series include The Basics of Craftsmanship, Finishes &amp; Finishing, Joinery, and Ingenious Jigs &amp; Shop Accessories.) Authored by such well-known woodworkers as Jim Tolpin and Garrett Hack, the essays cover a specific set of woodworking skills in detail. Practical Design takes a project from concept to finished product, covering the use of scale models, engineering, and construction options for tables, cabinets, and chairs. Woodworking Techniques shows how to build a variety of projects (tables, drawers, and doors) and covers specific techniques (hinge installation, veneering, and inlay). Because they are from Fine Woodworking, the selections are colorful and well written, and the inclusion of an index is helpful. These titles will appeal to woodworkers of all skill levels and are recommended for public libraries.DJonathan Hershey, Akron-Summit Cty.

Known as a &#x201c;modern&#x201d; quilter, she actually draws much of her creative vision from quilts of the past. In <i>Denyse Schmidt: Modern Quilts, Traditional Inspiration</i>, Schmidt pays homage to the quilters and quilts that came before her. Each of the 20 traditional quilt designs she has reinterpreted here (among them are Irish Chain, Mariner&#x2019;s Compass, and Orange Peel, to name a few) is introduced with a lively overview of the pattern&#x2019;s history. Instructions are illustrated, templates are provided at full size on a pullout pattern sheet, and a complete techniques section is included at the back of the book.<br><br>Praise for <i>Denyse Schmidt: Modern Quilts, Traditional Inspiration:</i><br>"Denyse Schmidt's contemporary art quilts are things of enduring style and beauty, but few fans realize her 16-year career as a textile artist began when Schmidt fell in love with tried-and-true, centuries-old traditional quilt patterns . . . <i>Modern Quilts, Traditional Inspiration</i> is the artist&#x2019;s return to this fertile terrain, featuring her colorful and updated take on 20 time-tested designs. Full-page photos of gorgeous quilts full of those bold geometric shapes that first inspired her provide ample motivation, while detailed instructions, a pull-out book of templates, and a section detailing tools and techniques offer plenty of how-to support, even for novice makers." &#x2014;<i>American Craft Magazine</i><br>"The book contains 20 traditional quilt styles that look exceptionally modern, hip, and fresh, with limited color palettes and minimal use of prints. To me, it is the best of both worlds&#x2014;tried-and-true patterns with stories to tell, interpreted by this talented woman who helped define modern quilting. The modern/traditional debate is moot here, which is refreshing and wonderful." &#x2014;<i>Sew Mama Sew!<br></i><br>&#x201c;It's been 7 years since Denyse Schmidt's first book, and believe me, this new volume was well worth the wait...Whether you consider yourself a traditional or modern quilter, there is plenty of inspiration here, in projects that play with the tantalizing pairing of vintage patterns and contemporary colors. Although Denyse explains the origins and alternate names of many of the patterns, she rarely offers them straight: she riffs off old patterns like Mariner's Compass and Wagon Wheel and strips them down to stark basics." --Meg Cox, Journalist, Author, and President of the Alliance for American Quilts<br><br>"Denyse Schmidt never ceases to inspire us . . . We are very excited to announce her latest book, the simply breathtaking <i>Modern Quilts, Traditional Inspiration</i>. Delving back to the traditional styles that first sparked her passion for quilting, Denyse gives these twenty quilt patterns a modern spin with bold, beautiful fabric choices." &#x2014;<i>The Purl Bee<br></i> "In this book, [Denyse] shows off a new gamut of wonderful quilts . . . She writes in such a quiet and contemplative way, reminding me that quilting at its best isn't meant to be done in a hurry to crank something out." &#x2014;Spoonflower.com</p><p><b>Denyse Schmidt</b>&#x2019;s work has been featured in hundreds of publications, including the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>TIME</i>, <i>People</i>, and <i>Martha Stewart Living</i>.

The Hearst estate, formally called <i>La Cuesta Encantada</i> ("the enchanted hill"), overlooks the gorgeous California coast, halfway between San Francisco and Los Angeles. In this unforgettable setting, Hearst, with architect Julia Morgan at his side, built and added onto and reconfigured his estate over a period of nearly three decades, from 1919 to 1947, and in the process collected artwork here in the U.S. and in Europe not only for display purposes but also as integral parts of the design structure. Kastner allows Hearst more credit as a sensitive collector than most critics have usually given him. Two major points are made here; that the relationship between Hearst and Morgan, his architect, was an especially productive and mutually satisfying one, and that Hearst Castle is not a "freak" of a dwelling but very much a "representative example of the American country-house tradition." Kastner proffers a delicious taste of the social life that guests enjoyed under the roof at Hearst Castle in Hearst's heyday, particularly after the advent of Hearst's beloved mistress, actress Marian Davies, who was a loving and lovable hostess. This book's brilliant match of words and illustrations results in a marvelous tour of the premises and an engrossing history. <i>Brad Hooper</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association. All rights reserved</i>Hearst Castle in San Simeon, now a California state park, offers a glimpse of the high life lead by William Randolph Hearst. Though originally planned as a small bungalow at the family's favorite campsite, Hearst's building project grew and grew. Julia Morgan, the renowned San Francisco architect, gracefully coped with the continuous revisions to the project. Hearst had a love of art and style and the money to follow his fancy. Kastner, a member of the Hearst Castle staff and a student of its art, combines the history of the castle with details about its inhabitants and its builders in this splendid book. The pages are peppered with historic photos, architectural drawings, correspondences, and details of the castle's features and its art. You can practically smell the opulence of the place. Strongly recommended for regional collections and large public libraries across the country. (Final photos and index not seen.)DKaren Ellis, Nicholson Memorial Lib.

The winner of the 1942 Caldecott Medal for THE LITTLE HOUSE, Burton's books include heroes and happy endings, lively illustrations, and a dash of nostalgia. She lived with her two sons, Aristides and Michael, and her husband George Demetrios, the sculptor, in a section of Gloucester, Massachusetts, called Folly Cove. Here she taught a class in design and from it emerged the Folly Cove designers, a group of internationally known professional artisans. She is the author of many classic children's picture books, including MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL and KATY AND THE BIG SNOW.</p>This story of Maybelle's fight to remain relevant in a world of progress is a classic. Burton (beloved author of MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL) wrote and illustrated this book in the 1950s to tell the tale of San Francisco's fight to save its cable cars from extinction. The story has an old-fashioned feel, which Peter Kovner's hearty narration does everything to enhance. Kovner enthusiastically produces all the required sounds (clangs, dings, conductor's calls), and the story's brisk pace is further fueled by Burton's rhymes and the pleasant background music that makes you want to hop on and join the ride.

Le Guin's Earthsea is a stunning fantasy world that grabs quickly at our hearts, pulling us deeply into its imaginary realms. Four books (<i>A Wizard of Earthsea</i>, <i>The Tombs of Atuan</i>, <i>The Farthest Shore</i>, and <i>Tehanu</i>) tell the whole Earthsea cycle--a tale about a reckless, awkward boy named Sparrowhawk who becomes a wizard's apprentice after the wizard reveals Sparrowhawk's true name. The boy comes to realize that his fate may be far more important than he ever dreamed possible. Le Guin challenges her readers to think about the power of language, how in the act of naming the world around us we actually create that world. Teens, especially, will be inspired by the way Le Guin allows her characters to evolve and grow into their own powers. <p> In this second book of Le Guin's Earthsea series, readers will meet Tenar, a priestess to the "Nameless Ones" who guard the catacombs of the Tombs of Atuan. Only Tenar knows the passageways of this dark labyrinth, and only <b>she</b> can lead the young wizard Sparrowhawk, who stumbles into its maze, to the greatest treasure of all. Will she?</p>Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea cycle has become one of the best-loved fantasies of our time. The windswept world of Earthsea is one of the greatest creations in all fantasy literature, frequently compared with J.R.R. Tolkien's <i>Middle Earth</i> or C.S. Lewis'<i>Narnia</i>. The magnificent saga begins with <i>A Wizard Of Earthsea</i>, continues in <i>The Tombs Of Atuan</i> and <i>The Farthest Shore</i>, and concludes with <i>Tehanu</i> --each book a treasure of wisdom, wonder, and literary wizardry. When she was still a child, Tenar was stripped of her name and family and dedicated as high priestess to the Nameless Ones, dark powers of <i>The Tombs of Atuan</i>. This is the tale of the young wizard, Ged, who came to the forbidden labyrinth to steal its greatest treasure--the Ring of Erreth-Akbe--and stayed to set Tenar free and lead her out of darkness.</p><h2>Fierce Women: The Power of a Soft Warrior (True Woman)</h2><p><p><b>Can you have a strong personality and still be a godly wife?

I wasn&#x2019;t even curious. It sounded like a waste of time.</p><p>What got me interested, though, was the phrase &#x201c;true happiness lies within.&#x201d; At first I thought it sounded kind of mean, because it doesn&#x2019;t tell you where the &#x201c;within&#x201d; is, or how to get there. But still it had a ring of truth. And I began to think that maybe meditation was a way to go within.</p><p>I looked into meditation, asked some questions, and started contemplating different forms. At that moment, my sister called and said she had been doing Transcendental Meditation for six months. There was something in her voice. A change. A quality of happiness. And I thought, That&#x2019;s what I want.</p><p>So in July 1973 I went to the TM center in Los Angeles and met an instructor, and I liked her. She looked like Doris Day. And she taught me this technique. She gave me a mantra, which is a sound-vibration-thought. You don&#x2019;t meditate on the meaning of it, but it&#x2019;s a very specific sound-vibration-thought.</p><p>She took me into a little room to have my first meditation. I sat down, closed my eyes, started this mantra, and it was as if I were in an elevator and the cable had been cut. Boom! I fell into bliss&#x2014;pure bliss. And I was just in there. Then the teacher said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s time to come out; it&#x2019;s been twenty minutes.&#x201d; And I said, &#x201c;IT&#x2019;S ALREADY BEEN TWENTY MINUTES?!&#x201d; And she said, &#x201c;Shhhh!&#x201d; because other people were meditating. It seemed so familiar, but also so new and powerful. After that, I said the word &#x201c;unique&#x201d; should be reserved for this experience.</p><p>It takes you to an ocean of pure consciousness, pure knowingness. But it&#x2019;s familiar; it&#x2019;s you. And right away a sense of happiness emerges&#x2014;not a goofball happiness, but a thick beauty.</p><p>I have never missed a meditation in thirty-three years. I meditate once in the morning and again in the afternoon, for about twenty minutes each time. Then I go about the business of my day. And I find that the joy of doing increases. Intuition increases. The pleasure of life grows. And negativity recedes.</p><p>suffocating</p><p>rubber clown suit</p><p>It would be easier to roll up the entire sky into</p><p>a small cloth than it would be to obtain true happiness</p><p>without knowing the Self.</p><p>upanishads</p><p>When I started meditating, I was filled with anxieties and fears. I felt a sense of depression and anger.</p><p>I often took out this anger on my first wife. After I had been meditating for about two weeks, she came to me and said, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d; I was quiet for a moment. But finally I said, &#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d; And she said, &#x201c;This anger, where did it go?&#x201d; And I hadn&#x2019;t even realized that it had lifted.</p><p>I call that depression and anger the Suffocating Rubber Clown Suit of Negativity. It&#x2019;s suffocating, and that rubber stinks. But once you start meditating and diving within, the clown suit starts to dissolve. You finally realize how putrid was the stink when it starts to go. Then, when it dissolves, you have freedom.</p><p>Anger and depression and sorrow are beautiful things in a story, but they&#x2019;re like poison to the filmmaker or artist. They&#x2019;re like a vise grip on creativity. If you&#x2019;re in that grip, you can hardly get out of bed, much less experience the flow of creativity and ideas. You must have clarity to create. You have to be able to catch ideas.</p><p>starting out</p><p>I started out just as a regular person, growing up in the Northwest. My father was a research scientist for the Department of Agriculture, studying trees. So I was in the woods a lot. And the woods for a child are magical. I lived in what people call small towns. My world was what would be considered about a city block, maybe two blocks. Everything occurred in that space. All the dreaming, all my friends existed in that small world. But to me it seemed so huge and magical. There was plenty of time available to dream and be with friends.</p><p>I liked to paint and I liked to draw. And I often thought, wrongly, that when you got to be an adult, you stopped painting and drawing and did something more serious. In the ninth grade, my family moved to Alexandria, Virginia. On the front lawn of my girlfriend&#x2019;s house one night, I met a guy named Toby Keeler. As we were talking, he said his father was a painter. I thought maybe he might have been a house painter, but further talking got me around to the fact that he was a fine �artist.</p><p>This conversation changed my life. I had been somewhat interested in science, but I suddenly knew that I wanted to be a painter. And I wanted to live the art life.</p><p>the art life</p><p>In high school, I read Robert Henri&#x2019;s book The Art Spirit, which prompted the idea of the art life. For me, living the art life meant a dedication to painting&#x2014;a complete dedication to it, making everything else secondary.</p><p>That, I thought, is the only way you&#x2019;re going to get in deep and discover things. So anything that distracts from that path of discovery is not part of the art life, in that way of thinking. Really, the art life means a freedom. And it seems, I think, a hair selfish. But it doesn&#x2019;t have to be selfish; it just means that you need time.</p><p>Bushnell Keeler, the father of my friend Toby, always had this expression: &#x201c;If you want to get one hour of good painting in, you have to have four hours of uninterrupted time.&#x201d;</p><p>And that&#x2019;s basically true. You don&#x2019;t just start painting. You have to sit for a while and get some kind of mental idea in order to go and make the right moves. And you need a whole bunch of materials at the ready. For example, you need to build framework stretchers for the canvas. It can take a long time just to prepare something to paint on. And then you go to work. The idea just needs to be enough to get you started, because, for me, whatever follows is a process of action and reaction. It&#x2019;s always a process of building and then destroying. And then, out of this destruction, discovering a thing and building on it. Nature plays a huge part in it. Putting difficult materials together&#x2014;like baking something in sunlight, or using one material that fights another material&#x2014;causes its own organic reaction. Then it&#x2019;s a matter of sitting back and studying it and studying it and studying it; and suddenly, you find you&#x2019;re leaping up out of your chair and going in and doing the next thing. That&#x2019;s action and reaction.</p><p><br></p><p>But if you know that you&#x2019;ve got to be somewhere in half an hour, there&#x2019;s no way you can achieve that. So the art life means a freedom to have time for the good things to happen. There&#x2019;s not always a lot of time for other things.</p></p><h2>Paris in Color: (Coffee Table Books About Paris, Travel Books)</h2><p>Take a journey through the world's most romantic city, traveling from color to magnificent color with this beguiling book.

As therapists Connie Zweig and Steve Wolf show in this landmark book, the shadow can actually be a source of emotional richness and vitality, and acknowledging it can be a pathway to healing and an authentic life. "Romancing the shadow"--meeting your dark side, beginning to understand its unconscious messages, and learning to use its powerful energies in productive ways--is the challenging and exciting soul work that Zweig and Wolf offer in this practical, rewarding guide.<br><br>Drawing on the timeless teachings of Carl Jung and compelling stories from their clinical practices, Zweig and Wolf reveal how the shadow guides your choices in love, sex, marriage, friendship, work, and family life. With their innovative method, you can uncover the unique patterns and purpose of your shadow and learn to defuse negative emotions; reclaim forbidden or lost feelings; achieve greater self-acceptance; heal betrayal; reimagine and re-create relationships; cultivate compassion for others; renew creative expressions; and find purpose in your suffering.<br><br>The shadow knows why good people sometimes do bad things. Romancing the shadow and learning to read the messages it encodes in daily life can deepen your consciousness, imagination, and soul.</p><p>According to authors Connie Zweig and Steve Wolf, each of us has shadows that hold forbidden feelings such as shame, jealousy, greed, lust, and rage. Left to their own devices these shadows will become destructive saboteurs--causing us to betray our loved ones as well as ourselves. It is not within our power to choose whether or not to have these shadows; however, Zweig and Wolf believe that it is within our power to take responsibility for our shadows and put them to productive use. Chapter by chapter Zweig and Wolf reveal the shadow side of love, parenthood, siblings, friendships, midlife, and work. Rather than deny or destroy these shadows, the authors show readers how to confront and &#34;romance&#34; them in order to access the energy, vitality, and creativity that usually lie dormant within our dark sides."True freedom lies in getting in touch with the Self, which is both divine and diabolical, sacred and profane. This book enables you to peel away the layers of your soul and get in touch with the purity of Being that lies within you."<br>--Deepak Chopra, M.D.<p>"At last, a compelling, evocative book that brilliantly elucidates the difficult concept of the shadow in straightforward language. Shadow-work is our greatest challenge to becoming a global village."<br>--Marion Woodman, Jungian analyst and author of <b>Dancing in the Flames: The Dark Goddess in the Transformation of Consciousness</b></p><p>"The secret is out: All of us, no exceptions, have qualities we won't let anyone see, including ourselves--our shadow. If we face up to our dark side, our life can be energized. If not, there is the devil to pay. This is one of life's most uregent projects."<br>--Larry Dossey, M.D., author of <b>Healing Words</b></p></p><h2>Born for Liberty</h2><p>The most concise and comprehensive one-volume history of American women&#x2014;from the indigenous women of the 16th-century wilderness to the dual-role career women and mothers of contemporary times&#x2014;this book brings American womanhood to center stage, exploring the lives of pioneers and slaves, immigrants and factory workers, executives and homemakers.</p><p>Sara M. Evans is McKnight Distinguished University Professor of History at the University of Minnesota.YA-- A fascinating, readable volume that discusses the continual reshaping of the role of women in America from the 17th century to the 1980s. Evans' chapters roughly coincide with standard textbook organization of history (early settlers, Revolutionary era, 1845-1865, etc.), which makes the book useful to students of American history searching for another viewpoint. Unlike earlier histories, which only discuss women in the home, Evans shows the impact husbands, brothers, and sons had on the women's lives and thinking, and the effect of women's actions on men's politics. Although women's place in society remains unchanged in many basic ways, the intervening 300 years have seen great changes in the acceptance of women in public and political spheres. Evans makes these changes understandable to lay readers who may not yet have a sense of the totality of American history. No library should be without this title that offers such unique insight into women's roles and history from early settlers and native Americans to modern CEOs. --Dorcas Hand, Episcopal High School, Bellaire, TX<br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Hellblazer, Vol. 2: The Devil You Know</h2><p>This volume features some of Constantine's earliest adventures by writer Jamie Delano, including his first victory in the long war with the demon Nergal and an encounter with a strange woman who is the embodiment of the world's horrors, painted by <i>V for Vendetta</i> co-creator David Lloyd.

When she uncovers an unusual fossilized skeleton in the cliffs near her home, she sets the religious community on edge, the townspeople to gossip, and the scientific world alight. After enduring bitter cold, thunderstorms, and landslips, her challenges only grow when she falls in love with an impossible man.<br><br> Mary soon finds an unlikely champion in prickly Elizabeth Philpot, a middle-class spinster who shares her passion for scouring the beaches. Their relationship strikes a delicate balance between fierce loyalty, mutual appreciation, and barely suppressed envy, but ultimately turns out to be their greatest asset.<br><br> <i>Remarkable Creatures </i>is a stunning historical novel that follows the story of two extraordinary 19th century fossil hunters who changed the scientific world forever.</p><p>"I was born and grew up in Washington, DC. After getting a BA in English from Oberlin College (Ohio), I moved to London, England in 1984. I intended to stay 6 months; I&#x2019;m still here. <p>"As a kid I&#x2019;d often said I wanted to be a writer because I loved books and wanted to be associated with them. I wrote the odd story in high school, but it was only in my twenties that I started writing &#x2018;real&#x2019; stories, at night and on weekends. Sometimes I wrote a story in a couple evenings; other times it took me a whole year to complete one. </p><p>"Once I took a night class in creative writing, and a story I&#x2019;d written for it was published in a London-based magazine called Fiction. I was thrilled, even though the magazine folded 4 months later. </p><p>I worked as a reference book editor for several years until 1993 when I left my job and did a year-long MA in creative writing at the University of East Anglia in Norwich (England). My tutors were the English novelists Malcolm Bradbury and Rose Tremain. For the first time in my life I was expected to write every day, and I found I liked it. I also finally had an idea I considered &#x2018;big&#x2019; enough to fill a novel. I began <b>The Virgin Blue</b> during that year, and continued it once the course was over, juggling writing with freelance editing. </p><p>"An agent is essential to getting published. I found my agent Jonny Geller through dumb luck and good timing. A friend from the MA course had just signed on with him and I sent my manuscript of <b>The Virgin Blue</b> mentioning my friend&#x2019;s name. Jonny was just starting as an agent and needed me as much as I needed him. Since then he&#x2019;s become a highly respected agent in the UK and I&#x2019;ve gone along for the ride."</p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Chevalier plays to all her strengths in this fascinating fact-based novel about Mary Anning, a working-class girl in early nineteenth-century Lyme Regis who finds dinosaurs fossils in the cliffs along the beach. Elizabeth Philpot, who could have stepped straight out of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, becomes Mary&#39;s friend and champion when her discoveries put her at odds with all-male, class-bound scientific communities that believe, at worst, that the world was created only 6,000 years ago and could not include extinct creatures, and, at best, that women cannot do science. Charlotte Parry creates a gutsy but vulnerable Mary while Susan Lyons gives us a proper and ladylike Elizabeth.

It will also show those who are not ill how they can participate in maintaining their health.<br> &nbsp;<br> We use the word participate to indicate the vital role you play in creating your own level of health. Most of us assume that healing is something done to us, that if we have a medical problem our responsibility is simply to get to a physician who will then heal us. That&#x2019;s true to a degree, but it is only part of the story.<br> &nbsp;<br> We all participate in our own health through our beliefs, our feelings, and our attitudes toward life, as well as in more direct ways, such as through exercise and diet. In addition, our response to medical treatment is influenced by our beliefs about the effectiveness of the treatment and by the confidence we have in the medical team.<br> &nbsp;<br> This book in no way minimizes the role of the physician and other health professionals engaged in medical treatment. Rather, Getting Well Again will describe what you can do in conjunction with medical treatment to gain the health you deserve.<br> &nbsp;<br> Understanding how much you can participate in your health or illness is a significant first step for everyone in getting well. For many of our patients it is the critically important step. It may well be for you, too.<br> &nbsp;<br> We are Carl and Stephanie Simonton, and we operate the Cancer Counseling and Research Center in Dallas, Texas. Carl, the medical director of the center, is a radiation oncologist, a physician specializing in the treatment of cancer. Stephanie is director of counseling and is trained in psychology.<br> &nbsp;<br> Most of our patients, who come to us from all over the country, have received a &#x201c;medically incurable&#x201d; diagnosis from their doctors. According to national cancer statistics, they have an average life expectancy of one year. When these people believe that only medical treatment can help them&#x2014;but their physicians have said that medicine is no longer of much avail and that they probably have only a few months to live&#x2014;they feel doomed, trapped, helpless, and usually fulfill the doctors&#x2019; expectations. But if patients mobilize their own resources and actively participate in their recovery, they may well exceed their life expectancy and significantly alter the quality of life.<br> &nbsp;<br> The ideas and techniques described in this book are the approach we employ at our Cancer Counseling and Research Center to show cancer patients how they can participate in getting well again and live a rewarding and fulfilling life.<br> &nbsp;<br> THE STARTING POINT: THE &#x201c;WILL TO LIVE&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Why do some patients recover their health and others die, when the diagnosis is the same for both? Carl became interested in this problem while he was completing his residency as a cancer specialist at the University of Oregon Medical School. There he noticed that patients who stated they wanted to live would often act as if they did not. There were lung cancer patients who refused to stop smoking, liver cancer patients who wouldn&#x2019;t cut down on alcohol, and others who wouldn&#x2019;t show up for treatment regularly.<br> &nbsp;<br> In many cases, these were people whose medical prognosis indicated that, with treatment, they could look forward to many more years of life. Yet while they affirmed again and again that they had countless reasons to live, these patients showed a greater apathy, depression, and attitude of giving up than did a number of others diagnosed with terminal disease.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the latter category was a small group of patients who had been sent home after minimal treatment, with little expectation that they would live to see their first follow-up appointment. Yet several years later, they were still arriving for their annual or semiannual examinations, remaining in quite good health, and inexplicably beating the statistics.<br> &nbsp;<br> When Carl asked them to account for their good health they would frequently give such answers as, &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t die until my son graduates from college,&#x201d; or &#x201c;They need me too much at work,&#x201d; or &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t die until I&#x2019;ve solved the problem with my daughter.&#x201d; The common thread running through these replies was the belief that they exerted some influence over the course of their disease. The essential difference between these patients and those who would not cooperate was in their attitude toward their disease and their positive stance toward life. The patients who continued to do well, for one reason or another, had a stronger &#x201c;will to live.&#x201d; This discovery fascinated us.<br> &nbsp;<br> Stephanie, whose background was in motivational counseling, had an interest in unusual achievers&#x2014;those people who in business seemed destined to go to the top. She had studied the behavior of exceptional performers and had taught the principles of that behavior to average achievers. It seemed reasonable to study cancer patients in the same way&#x2014;to learn what those who were doing well had in common, and how they differed from those who were doing poorly.<br> &nbsp;<br> If the difference between the patient who regains his health and the one who does not is in part a matter of attitude toward the disease and belief that he could somehow influence it, then, we wondered, how could we influence patients&#x2019; beliefs in that positive direction? Might we be able to apply techniques from motivational psychology to induce and enhance a &#x201c;will to live&#x201d;? Beginning in 1969, we began looking at all the possibilities, exploring such diverse psychological techniques as encounter groups, group therapy, meditation, mental imagery, positive thinking, motivational techniques, &#x201c;mind development&#x201d; courses like Silva Mind Control and Mind Dynamics, and biofeedback.<br> &nbsp;<br> From our study of biofeedback, we learned that certain techniques were enabling people to influence their own internal body processes, such as heart rate and blood pressure. An important aspect of biofeedback, called visual imagery, was also a principal component of other techniques we had studied. The more we learned about the process, the more intrigued we became.<br> &nbsp;<br> Essentially, the visual imagery process involved a period of relaxation, during which the patient would mentally picture a desired goal or result. With the cancer patient, this would mean his attempting to visualize the cancer, the treatment destroying it and, most importantly, his body&#x2019;s natural defenses helping him recover. After discussion with two leading biofeedback researchers, Drs. Joe Kamiya and Elmer Green, of the Menninger Clinic, we decided to use visual imagery techniques with cancer patients.<br> &nbsp;<br> THE FIRST PATIENT: A DRAMATIC EXAMPLE<br> &nbsp;<br> The first patient with whom an attempt was made to apply our developing theories was a sixty-one-year-old man who came to the medical school in 1971 with a form of throat cancer that carried a grave prognosis. He was very weak, his weight had dropped from 130 to 98 pounds, he could barely swallow his own saliva, and was having difficulty breathing. There was less than a 5 percent chance that he would survive five years. Indeed, the medical school doctors had seriously debated whether to treat him at all, since it was distinctly possible that therapy would only make him more miserable without significantly diminishing his cancer.<br> &nbsp;<br> Carl went into the examining room determined to help this man actively participate in his treatment. This was a case that justified using exceptional measures. Carl began treating the patient by explaining how the patient himself could influence the course of his own disease. Carl then outlined a program of relaxation and mental imagery based on the research we had been accumulating. The man was to set aside three, five-to-fifteen-minute periods during the day&#x2014;in the morning on arising, at noon after lunch, and at night before going to bed. During these periods he was first to compose himself by sitting quietly and concentrating on the muscles of his body, starting with his head and going all the way to his feet, telling each muscle group to relax. Then, in this more relaxed state, he was to picture himself in a pleasant, quiet place&#x2014;sitting under a tree, by a creek, or anywhere that suited his fancy, so long as it was pleasurable. Following this he was to imagine his cancer vividly in whatever form it seemed to take.<br> &nbsp;<br> Next, Carl asked him to picture his treatment, radiation therapy, as consisting of millions of tiny bullets of energy that would hit all the cells, both normal and cancerous, in their path. Because the cancer cells were weaker and more confused than the normal cells, they would not be able to repair the damage, Carl suggested, and so the normal cells would remain healthy while the cancer cells would die.<br> &nbsp;<br> Carl then asked the patient to form a mental picture of the last and most important step&#x2014;his body&#x2019;s white blood cells coming in, swarming over the cancer cells, picking up and carrying off the dead and dying ones, flushing them out of his body through his liver and kidneys. In his mind&#x2019;s eye he was to visualize his cancer decreasing in size and his health returning to normal. After he completed each such exercise, he was to go about whatever he had to do the rest of the day.<br> &nbsp;<br> What happened was beyond any of Carl&#x2019;s previous experience in treating cancer patients with purely physical intervention. The radiation therapy worked exceptionally well, and the man showed almost no negative reaction to the radiation on his skin or in the mucous membranes in his mouth and throat. Halfway through treatment he was able to eat again. He gained strength and weight. The cancer progressively disappeared.<br> &nbsp;<br> During the course of treatment&#x2014;both the radiation therapy and the mental imagery&#x2014;the patient reported missing only one mental imagery session on a day when he went for a drive with a friend and was caught in a traffic jam. He was most upset, both with himself and with his friend, for in missing just that one session he felt his control over his condition was slipping away.<br> &nbsp;<br> Treating this patient in this way was very exciting, but it was also somewhat frightening. The possibilities for methods of healing that seemed to be opening up before us went beyond anything that Carl&#x2019;s formal medical education had prepared him for.<br> &nbsp;<br> The patient continued to progress until finally, two months later, he showed no signs of cancer. The strength of his conviction that he could influence the course of his own illness was evident when, close to the end of his treatment, he said to Car): &#x201c;Doctor, in the beginning I needed you in order to get well. Now I think you could disappear and I could still make it on my own.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Anne Frank: The Diary Of A Young Girl</h2><p><p>A young girl's journal records her family's struggles during two years of hiding from the Nazis in war-torn Holland.

Turtleback books are ideal for any reader, or for use in schools or libraries.</p></p><p>A beloved classic since its initial publication in 1947, this vivid, insightful journal is a fitting memorial to the gifted Jewish teenager who died at Bergen-Belsen, Germany, in 1945. Born in 1929, Anne Frank received a blank diary on her 13th birthday, just weeks before she and her family went into hiding in Nazi-occupied Amsterdam. Her marvelously detailed, engagingly personal entries chronicle 25 trying months of claustrophobic, quarrelsome intimacy with her parents, sister, a second family, and a middle-aged dentist who has little tolerance for Anne's vivacity. The diary's universal appeal stems from its riveting blend of the grubby particulars of life during wartime (scant, bad food; shabby, outgrown clothes that can't be replaced; constant fear of discovery) and candid discussion of emotions familiar to every adolescent (everyone criticizes me, no one sees my real nature, when will I be loved?). Yet Frank was no ordinary teen: the later entries reveal a sense of compassion and a spiritual depth remarkable in a girl barely 15. Her death epitomizes the madness of the Holocaust, but for the millions who meet Anne through her diary, it is also a very individual loss. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>The diary as Anne Frank wrote it. At last, in a new translation, this definitive edition contains entries about Anne's burgeoning sexuality and confrontations with her mother that were cut from previous editions. Anne Frank's <i>The Diary Of A Young Girl</i> is among the most enduring documents of the twentieth century. Since its publication in 1947, it has been a beloved and deeply admired monument to the indestructible nature of the human spirit, read by millions of people and translated into more than fifty-five languages. Doubleday, which published the first English translation of the diary in 1952, now offers a new translation that captures Anne's youthful spirit and restores the original material omitted by Anne's father, Otto -- approximately thirty percent of the diary. The elder Frank excised details about Anne's emerging sexuality, and about the often-stormy relations between Anne and her mother. Anne Frank and her family, fleeing the horrors of Nazi occupation forces, hid in the back of an Amsterdam office building for two years. This is Anne's record of that time. She was thirteen when the family went into the "Secret Annex," and in these pages, she grows to be a young woman and proves to be an insightful observer of human nature as well. A timeless story discovered by each new generation, <i>The Diary Of A Young Girl</i> stands without peer. For young readers and adults, it continues to bring to life this young woman, who for a time survived the worst horrors the modern world had seen -- and who remained triumphantly and heartbreakingly human throughout her ordeal.</p><h2>Saint Joseph Bible-NABRE</h2><p><p>The Full-Size Student Edition of the St. Joseph New American (Catholic) Bible from Catholic Book Publishing includes the complete Old and New Testaments in large, easy-to-read 11-pt. type.

His works include <i>Disidentifications: Queers of Color and the Performance of Politics </i>(1999), <i>Cruising Utopia: The Then and There of Queer Futurity</i> (2009), as well as the forthcoming <i>The Sense of Brown</i>. He was co-editor of <i>Pop Out: Queer Warhol</i> (1996) and <i>Everynight Life: Culture and Dance in Latin/o America</i> (1997) and founding co-editor of the Sexual Cultures series at NYU Press."Gay liberation's activist past and pragmatic present are merely prologue to a queer cultural future, Mu�oz suggests in this critical condemnation of the political status quo. Casting his vision of a radical gay aesthetic through the prisms of literature, photography and performance, the author dismisses commonplace concerns like same-sex marriage as desires for "mere inclusion" in a "corrupt" mainstream. More defiantly, he exalts the persistence of commercial sex spaces in the face of &#x2018;antisex and homphobic policings,&#x2019; and celebrates the overlay of punk and queer in performance spaces." (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>"Brilliant, extraordinary, and necessary, Mu�oz&#x2019;s critical refusal of queer pragmatism, his commitment to the utopian force of the radical attempt&#x2015;the radical aesthetic, erotic, and philosophical experiment&#x2015;is indispensable in an historical moment characterized by political surrender and intellectual timidity passing itself off as boldness."</p><h2>The Country Girls: Three Novels and an Epilogue: (The Country Girl; The Lonely Girl; Girls in Their Married Bliss; Epilogue) (FSG Classics)</h2><p><p><b>A treasure of world literature back in print, featuring a new introduction by Eimear McBride</b></p><p>The country girls are Caithleen &#x201c;Kate&#x201d; Brady and Bridget &#x201c;Baba&#x201d; Brennan, and their story begins in the repressive atmosphere of a small village in the west of Ireland in the years following World War II.

She knows the exact number because she keeps a list. Like #95: Because her skin is so dark, people call her charcoal and eggplant&#x2014;even her own family. And #61: Because her family is always being put out of their house, belongings laid out on the sidewalk for the world to see. When your dad is a gambling addict and loses the rent money every month, eviction is a regular occurrence.<br> <br>What&#x2019;s not so regular is that this time they all don&#x2019;t have a place to crash, so Genesis and her mom have to stay with her grandma. It&#x2019;s not that Genesis doesn&#x2019;t like her grandma, but she and Mom always fight&#x2014;Grandma haranguing Mom to leave Dad, that she should have gone back to school, that if she&#x2019;d married a lighter skinned man none of this would be happening, and on and on and on. But things aren&#x2019;t all bad. Genesis actually likes her new school; she&#x2019;s made a couple friends, her choir teacher says she has real talent, and she even encourages Genesis to join the talent show.<br> <br>But how can Genesis believe anything her teacher says when her dad tells her the exact opposite? How can she stand up in front of all those people with her dark, dark skin knowing even her own family thinks lesser of her because of it? Why, why, why won&#x2019;t the lemon or yogurt or fancy creams lighten her skin like they&#x2019;re supposed to? And when Genesis reaches #100 on the list of things she hates about herself, will she continue on, or can she find the strength to begin again?</p><p>Alicia Williams is a graduate of the MFA program at Hamline University.

Even though I couldn&#x2019;t determine the correct term of equality in math, shanked the nearly airless volleyball in PE, and truly didn&#x2019;t care to discuss the effects of the Civil War in social studies, I was unshook, &#x2019;cause today my girls finally agreed to hang out with me&#x2014;at my house!<br> <br>And with Regina to my right cracking jokes, Fatima and Tasha and Angela to my left laughing insanely loud, shoot, every eye is on us. Boys jockin&#x2019; us&#x2014;well, actually jockin&#x2019; them. Regardless, they&#x2019;re grinning like we&#x2019;re all a bag of M&amp;M&#x2019;s. I&#x2019;m so amped that I actually yell this to the guys. And don&#x2019;t you know&#x2014;Regina uses my line as a jump off, cracking, &#x201c;And y&#x2019;all ain&#x2019;t &#x2019;bout to taste none of us either!&#x201d; We all slap hands and keep it moving.<br> <br>Regina&#x2019;s going on about her plans for us to watch music videos, &#x2019;cause Tasha&#x2019;s crushing on some new hot singer. And in my mind, we&#x2019;re all sitting on the couch debating which rapper is the finest. Then, we&#x2019;ll drink Sprite and eat the chips that Mama went out to buy especially for us.<br> <br>But as soon as we round the corner of my block, my heart skips like a scratched CD. Not again. Please, not again. But yes, again. All our furniture sits in the front yard&#x2014;but this time it&#x2019;s laid out exactly like it had been inside the house, as if the movers are playing a cruel joke. Our glass living room table sits in front of the couch with a cocktail table on each side. The kitchen chairs are properly placed with the dining table. Even our beds are still made with the blankets and pillows.<br> <br>&#x201c;This your house?&#x201d; Regina says, flicking her long braids.<br> <br>&#x201c;Uh, no.&#x201d; Dad. Didn&#x2019;t he know today was epic for me? &#x201c;I live over there,&#x201d; I say, pointing to a house where the metal bars on the security door swirl in an elegant design.<br> <br>&#x201c;She lying,&#x201d; Fatima butts in. &#x201c;I saw her go in this one the other day.&#x201d; &#x201c;This one&#x201d; is a small brick house with peeling green trim, chipped up cement steps, and straight metal bars on the door and windows like a prison.<br> <br>Now I understand what Grandma means when she says, &#x201c;There&#x2019;s always one.&#x201d; Regina snorts, &#x201c;Hey, y&#x2019;all, Genesis gotta pee outside!&#x201d; Then she throws back her head and bursts out laughing. The other three start laughing too. A bunch of copycats.<br> <br>I open my mouth, but nothing comes out. They&#x2019;re whispering and pointing, and my family&#x2019;s STUFF IS SITTING IN THE YARD! &#x201c;You know what?&#x201d; I finally come up with. &#x201c;I forgot, my mama said we were getting new furniture.&#x201d;<br> <br>Angela raises an eyebrow. High. &#x201c;Not with that big ol&#x2019; metal thing covering the doorknob, you ain&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br> <br>They all swivel their heads at the same time and mutter, &#x201c;Danggggg.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nobody&#x2019;s getting through that door besides the landlord,&#x201d; Angela jabs.<br> <br>Regina turns to me, smirking. &#x201c;Just admit your folks are bums.&#x201d;<br> <br>I search their faces, hoping at least one of them will stick up for me. But no one, not even Tasha&#x2014;whose mama&#x2019;s car was repossessed in the middle of the night just the other week!&#x2014;says a peep. Yes, I know a repossessed car ain&#x2019;t as serious as finding your stuff spread out in the yard for everybody to see, but still. &#x201c;No, uhm&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; I&#x2019;m out of lies. Dad. Dad. Dad. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just that&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just that it is what it is, ain&#x2019;t that right, y&#x2019;all?&#x201d; They all &#x201c;yep&#x201d; as Regina now roams around the couch and tables, stalking. &#x201c;Furniture so busted even the Goodwill don&#x2019;t want it.&#x201d;<br> <br>The copycats &#x201c;hee-hee-hee&#x201d; again. This time I force myself to laugh right along with them. &#x201c;I know, right!&#x201d; I agree, trailing her.<br> <br>&#x201c;I knew you were poor, but dang&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Regina struts past our kitchen set, pokes at a wobbly chair. &#x201c;This is pitiful, Char.&#x201d;<br> <br>I try hard to not visibly wince. Char. Short for Charcoal. Since I started at this school, I&#x2019;ve laughed at their jokes and sucked it all up to make friends. And I&#x2019;d made progress; just this last week they stopped calling me Eggplant. And then they&#x2019;d agreed to come over.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>Regina beelines toward a cluster of furniture that had clearly been in my bedroom. &#x201c;Y&#x2019;all wanna see some of Char&#x2019;s hand-me-downs?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t!&#x201d; I slip in front of my dresser, stretching my arms across it protectively.<br> <br>Regina shoves at me, but I&#x2019;m not budging. &#x201c;Move it, CharCOAL!&#x201d;<br> <br>And now I&#x2019;m mad. And when I get mad, my mouth shoots off before it can connect to my brain. And now my mouth&#x2019;s dishing out a response faster than I can stop it, because how could she? How dare she?!<br> <br>&#x201c;You know what?&#x201d; I shoot back. &#x201c;Forget you! You&#x2019;re not all that with yo&#x2019; ratchet Black Barbie wannabe self.&#x201d;<br> <br>Silence.<br> <br>Dead silence.<br> <br>Now I&#x2019;ve done it. Good-bye, Regina. Good-bye, Tasha, Fatima, and Angela. Good-bye, any chance at&#x2014;stop it! I tell myself. Maybe she won&#x2019;t take too much offense to my clap-back.<br> <br>No chance. Regina stands rigid, her hands ball into fists. Her posse rallies closer. &#x201c;What did you say?&#x201d; she says, her voice low, dangerous. All four of them edge toward me. Slow. Steady. &#x201c;Say it again.&#x201d;<br> <br>No way am I saying it again.<br> <br>Regina narrows her eyes. One fist starts coming up. And then, oh merciful Lord, a screen door slams. My neighbor. My neighbor who&#x2019;s never said two words to me since we moved in now stands, wide-legged, on her porch. She sizes up the furniture, me, Regina, and the girls. Regina glowers back, maybe waiting for her to leave so they can pummel the living daylights out of me. My neighbor doesn&#x2019;t leave. She stares us down.<br> <br>Finally, Regina raises her chin. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t let me catch you around, Eggplant. Come on, y&#x2019;all,&#x201d; and in unison the other three turn and march out of my yard. Down the sidewalk.<br> <br>Bang! The screen door closes as my neighbor goes back into her house.<br> <br>And now I&#x2019;m left with, well, with this! I fall on my bed&#x2014;which is OUTSIDE&#x2014;and pray I don&#x2019;t ever have to see Regina and &#x2019;em again. Then I curse Dad for not paying the rent. Again. I curse him for making me wait out here while passing spectators stare stupidly, like maybe I don&#x2019;t realize furniture is supposed to be inside a house.<br> <br>Then I curse myself. For believing someone like Regina would even be friends with me.<br> <br>But I&#x2019;m not gon&#x2019; cry. I&#x2019;m not. Especially &#x2019;cause even though our neighbor might be back inside, she&#x2019;s watching from her window. It&#x2019;s getting chilly now, so I reach over and dig in my drawer for a sweatshirt. But my hand first finds a sheet of paper&#x2014;The List. I pull it out.<br> <br><br> <br>The List. Even though the paper&#x2019;s wrinkled and worn, I review and add to it all the time. Back in fifth grade, Chyna and Porsche slid a note onto my desk. Gullible me thought it was an invitation. And then I read the title: 100 REASONS WHY WE HATE GENESIS.<br> <br>Stupid girls. Couldn&#x2019;t even count. They only listed sixty reasons; and they were stretching it, too, because some were really dumb, like #1: She smiles too much, or #39: She thinks she got pretty writing, and even #46: She bumped into me and acted like she didn&#x2019;t know it.<br> <br>Shoot, they should&#x2019;ve just asked me for the rest. Because I&#x2019;ve already added twenty-four others, like #73: Because she&#x2019;s always getting put out of her house. Or, what I&#x2019;ll add now, #85: Because her friends dump her when they see her stuff on the curb like a Salvation Army pickup.<br> <br>After reading over the entire list, my fingers refuse to fold the paper back up. Thoughts of how badly I wanted to strut down the halls with Regina and her girls keep needling me. Of course I&#x2019;d never actually be one of them, but just being with them was good enough, you know? When I&#x2019;m with them, someone else is on the sidelines admiring me, no clue I&#x2019;m fronting like my life&#x2019;s all that. But now I picture Regina&#x2019;s face from fifteen minutes ago and how I laughed at myself to prove I could take a joke, because yes, I really could. Except none of that was a joke. So, I guess I proved I&#x2019;m great at frontin&#x2019;. Now, my fingers tremble as I add #86:<br> <br>Because she let them call her Charcoal, Eggplant, and Blackie.<br> <br>I bury the note back in my dresser and pull out that sweatshirt. Then I patrol around the yard like a security guard. On my third round, a cab pulls up. Mama jumps out wearing pink scrubs, and the cab speeds off. &#x201c;You all right?&#x201d; she calls, immediately wading through the &#x201c;rooms,&#x201d; inspecting each item.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m cold, and I gotta go,&#x201d; I say, nodding at that big device covering the doorknob.<br> <br>&#x201c;Anybody bother our stuff?&#x201d; Mama rummages through her dresser drawer.<br> <br>&#x201c;Not since I&#x2019;ve been here. Why we get put out again?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not now, Genesis.&#x201d; Mama removes some papers from the drawer and shoves them into her purse, picks up her jewelry box and tucks it under her arm. &#x201c;Well, this is a first.&#x201d; Mama&#x2019;s surveying the yard, turning in a complete circle. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think we&#x2019;ve ever been put out so neatly before.&#x201d;<br> <br>After what seems like forever, but actually is only five minutes later, a silver Cadillac parks in front of the house. Mama checks her watch and says, &#x201c;Right on time, thank God.&#x201d;<br> <br>An old man climbs out. &#x201c;Mrs. Anderson&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Mr. Myers, thank you so much for meeting me.&#x201d; Mama blinks her big brown eyes.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ordinarily, I wouldn&#x2019;t because it&#x2019;s your husband&#x2019;s name that&#x2019;s on the lease, and&#x2014;&#x201d; His eyes meet Mama&#x2019;s and just like that, his clenched jaw softens. &#x201c;I hate to do this, Mrs. Anderson, I really do, but you all haven&#x2019;t paid in months.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know, cutbacks at the plant. My husband lost half his hours, half his paycheck.&#x201d; Mama gives that same reason every time, but never confesses where the other half of Dad&#x2019;s paycheck goes. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re awfully sorry.&#x201d;<br> <br>We follow him to the porch and up the cracked steps. Mr. Myers gives Mama a gentle smile as he unbolts the metal lockout device. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do this favor&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. only for you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m truly grateful,&#x201d; says Mama, stepping inside. &#x201c;I really am.&#x201d;<br> <br>I race to the bathroom and my bladder&#x2019;s grateful that the movers left behind the tissue. When I come out, Mama&#x2019;s searching the kitchen cabinets. She turns to me, instructing, &#x201c;Genesis, do a final sweep of your room, just to make sure the movers got everything. Okay?&#x201d;<br> <br>In my room, a mirror hangs on the other side of the closet door. No matter how many times I shut it, that door cracks back open. Now, as I check inside to make sure nothing&#x2019;s been left behind, the mirror faces me. It hates me too.<br> <br>We stand in a stare-off like Celie did in The Color Purple, this old movie that Mama watches every dang time it comes on TV. In the movie, gorgeous Shug Avery makes Celie face herself in the mirror to convince her she&#x2019;s beautiful, even though Shug called Celie ugly in the first place. &#x201c;You sho&#x2019; is ugly.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s exactly how Shug said it too. And here I am, facing myself like Celie. &#x201c;Well?&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;Get on with it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Look at you, with that wide nose, my reflection says.<br> <br>I pinch my nostrils down.<br> <br>And those big lips.<br> <br>I smash my lips tight.<br> <br>And that nappy head.<br> <br>I finger the tangles loose.<br> <br>Don&#x2019;t get me started on how black you are.<br> <br>I want to say something, but what? That I think I&#x2019;m cute? &#x2019;Cause I&#x2019;m not. That I have good hair? &#x2019;Cause I don&#x2019;t. That I&#x2019;m not dark? &#x2019;Cause I am.<br> <br>Who you think&#x2019;s gonna love you with the way you look? Cackling echoes through the mirror so loud it could shatter.<br> <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t stand you,&#x201d; I say to my reflection.<br> <br>I slam the door, trapping the voices inside.<br> <br><br> <br>When we&#x2019;re done, Mr. Myers ushers us back outside, then covers the door handle with the lockout device. Mama holds a box full of spices and canned foods that she found in the kitchen. My search came up empty. She apologizes again for the inconvenience, and for not paying the rent. Mr. Myers kindly shakes his head. He feels bad for us, I can tell. He doesn&#x2019;t have steely eyes like the last three landlords. They looked at us like we were dirt, even though they&#x2019;re probably only mad about being cheated out of their money. Which is fair, I guess. But Mr. Myers&#x2019;s eyes are sad, even as he drives away from the curb. I wave good-bye, but he doesn&#x2019;t see it.<br> <br>Mama finds the trash bags and hands me one. &#x201c;Get your clothes out of the drawers and put &#x2019;em in these.&#x201d; She does the same. When we&#x2019;re done, we both sink onto the couch and wait for Dad. I shiver and Mama takes the couch&#x2019;s throw blanket and wraps it around my shoulders. She checks her watch again.<br> <br>&#x201c;What time is it?&#x201d; I ask.<br> <br>&#x201c;Almost five.&#x201d; Mama rubs the chill from her legs. Her scrubs are no match for the cold. I take the throw from my shoulders and cover us both. She digs her cell phone from her purse and checks it. More cars drive past, folks looking at us like we&#x2019;re crazy.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mama&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;,&#x201d; I say hesitantly. She looks at me, confused, so I add, &#x201c;Did you forget? Today my friends were coming over.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mama slaps her forehead. &#x201c;Oh, Genesis, I&#x2019;m so sorry. I&#x2019;m so sorry.&#x201d; She asks what happened, and I tell her everything besides the confrontation part. She apologizes again and promises to make it up to me when things get back to normal. Things are never &#x201c;normal,&#x201d; but I make a mental note to remind her, if they ever are.<br> <br>For another half hour we sit on the couch, cuddled up. Mama calls Dad twice, and each time he says he&#x2019;s on his way. She&#x2019;s about to hit his number for a third time when he drives up, followed by a U-Haul truck.<br> <br>Before Dad can step a foot on the curb, Mama&#x2019;s already up, fussing. &#x201c;What took you so long? You know how cold it is? Guess you want us to catch the death of pneumonia, huh?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Calm down! I told you I had to pick up Dwight and Mike.&#x201d; Dwight and Mike stand next to the U-Haul and nod when Dad says their names. &#x201c;Then we had to go back &#x2019;cross town to get the truck.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;From the looks of your red eyes, you been doing more than that,&#x201d; Mama says, all sly. Then she points a finger at him saying, &#x201c;You told me the rent was taken care of, then you have me leave my job to cover your mess&#x2014;YOURS.&#x201d;<br> <br>Dad opens and closes his mouth. I wait a few seconds for his reaction, and when he doesn&#x2019;t go off, then I get up too.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, you did say this wasn&#x2019;t gon&#x2019; happen again,&#x201d; I echo, wrapping the throw around me, and standing next to Mama. Just to think, Dad was off somewhere drinking while Regina and her crew were tryna&#x2019; drag me. So I add, &#x201c;And we were called bums, and I almost got into a fight.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mama turns to me. &#x201c;A fight?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Almost,&#x201d; I cover. Now I&#x2019;m mad all over again. &#x201c;How would you like to be called a bum?&#x201d;<br> <br>For a second time, Dad seems at a loss for words. But he recovers and finally says, &#x201c;But you okay, right?&#x201d;<br> <br>I nod, but Mama&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. if her eyes were lasers, she&#x2019;d surely roast Dad with the look she&#x2019;s giving him.<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; he says, acting clueless. &#x201c;She said she was okay.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Your child is out here about to fight over this mess? Is this what you want for Genesis?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I hope not,&#x201d; I mumble under my breath.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on, Gen. Let&#x2019;s get you warm.&#x201d; Mama holds out a hand. &#x201c;Give me the keys, so I can start the car.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So, you mad? You lookin&#x2019; at me like this is all my fault!&#x201d; Dad&#x2019;s left eye squints, like a tick. Here it comes. This is when the alcohol usually starts talking. Mama doesn&#x2019;t respond, and I take two steps back. But Dad, he just reaches into his pocket, pulls out the keychain, and drops it into Mama&#x2019;s hand. Then he jogs over to Dwight and Mike, gestures to the yard, and they get to work loading the truck.<br> <br>Whaaa? Whew, Dad&#x2019;s response was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. chill. Then I think, Dang, the night ain&#x2019;t over....</p><h2>Fundamentals of Musical Composition</h2><p><i>Fundamentals of Musical Composition</i> represents the culmination of more than forty years in Schoenberg's life devoted to the teaching of musical principles to students and composers in Europe and America. For his classes he developed a manner of presentation in which 'every technical matter is discussed in a very fundamental way, so that at the same time it is both simple and thorough'.<br><br>This book can be used for analysis as well as for composition. On the one hand, it has the practical objective of introducing students to the process of composing in a systematic way, from the smallest to the largest forms; on the other hand, the author analyses in thorough detail and with numerous illustrations those particular sections in the works of the masters which relate to the compositional problem under discussion.</p><p>Arnold Schoenberg (1874-1951) was an Austrian composer, later moving to the United States, and was leader of the Second Viennese School. In the 1920s, Schoenberg developed the twelve-tone technique, and his approach, both in terms of harmony and development, is among the major landmarks of twentieth-century musical thought. The extraordinary scope of Schoenberg&#39;s intelligence, and the often prophetic character of his insights, make his writings on music an indispensable source for anyone interested in the complex history of twentieth-century music.</p><h2>The Lavender Lover&#39;s Handbook: The 100 Most Beautiful and Fragrant Varieties for Growing, Crafting, and Cooking</h2><p><p><b>&#x201c;The best recent all-around lavender book with something for gardeners, crafters, and cooks alike.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Library Journal</i></b><br><br> Lavender is beloved for its and culinary and medicinal uses.

In 2000 she purchased a five-acre farm south of Portland, Oregon, and after visiting the Sequim Lavender Festival in Washington and seeing rows and rows of this wondrous herb, decided to create a test plot of 365 plants despite knowing nothing about planting lavender. She learned through trial and error, helped by a little-known society of lavender pioneers who had dedicated their careers to cultivating, growing, and preserving the true species of lavender. Soon she purchased many varieties of lavender from a seasoned grower in Oregon who had propagated starts from his own extensive collection acquired over a twenty-year span. </p><p>In 2005 she planted almost 5000 lavender plants with more than ninety cultivars and began propagating her own starts from cuttings. She opened her farm to the public and began holding the classes that inspired this book. Sarah and her farm, Lavender at Stonegate, have been featured in regional publications, on television and radio, and in <i>Grower Talks</i> and <i>Country Gardens</i> magazines. </p></p><h2>A Brief History of Vice: How Bad Behavior Built Civilization</h2><p><b>A celebration of the brave, drunken pioneers who built our civilization one seemingly bad decision at a time,&nbsp;<i>A Brief History of Vice</i>&nbsp;explores a side of the past that mainstream history books prefer to hide.&nbsp;History has never been more fun&#x2014;or more intoxicating.</b><br><br> Guns, germs, and steel might have transformed us from hunter-gatherers into modern man, but booze, sex, trash talk, and tripping built our civilization.&nbsp;<i>Cracked</i>&nbsp;editor Robert Evans brings his signature dogged research and lively insight to uncover the many and magnificent ways vice has influenced history, from the prostitute-turned-empress who scored a major victory for women&#x2019;s rights to the beer that helped create&#x2014;and destroy&#x2014;South America's first empire.

Itwas a conundrum. Sure, I knew people who were over twenty-one and willing tobuy me alcohol. But most of them were just as shady as you?d expect based onthe fact that they were willing to buy alcohol for teenagers. Also, I was poorenough that my options for affordable drinking were limited to six-dollarbottles of leaded vodka and, if I was really hard up, Boone's Farm.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; But a goodfriend of mine made beer in his kitchen, and he'd walked me through the basicchemistry of the fermentation process. I knew it started with yeast, theone-celled fungi that live in vast colonies, feast on sugar, and poop outalcohol. Brewers simply trapped yeast, a bunch of rotting sugary plant matter,and water in a container and let it all sit for a while until, eventually, beerhappened.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I couldn'tafford to brew beer, though. A five-gallon batch cost upward of forty dollarsin ingredients, a fortune in teenager money. Thankfully, there was a dirtier,easier, route: I could buy a bunch of cheap fruit, mash it up, toss it into abucket with water and yeast, and let that turn into something foul butintoxicating. My friends and I called the resultant brew "hobo jug wine," andhere is the recipe we used:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ingredients</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1 five-gallon food-grade plastic bucket</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1 length of hose, a finger's width or so</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1 smaller bucket</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Enough pineapples/oranges/apples/whatever fruit to fillup half the bucket</p><p>Instructions</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peel and chopthe fruit and fill the bucket half full of fruit. Mash it into a pulp, and thenadd water, and cane sugar, if you feel like really taking your sobriety totask. If you're as poor as I was, you can make do with grabbing five gallons' worth of fruit juice concentrate from the grocer's freezer in lieu of honest,God-fearing fruit. Drop a packet of yeast (Fleischmann's bread yeast works justfine) into the mixture, stir, and stick the top of the bucket on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This nextpart's critical: Booze gives off a lot of CO2 while it's fermenting. You'llwant to make a little hole in the lid of the bucket and run the hose out of itand into the smaller bucket filled with water. That hose will let enough CO2escape that your large bucket won't explode into shards of painful plastic-yshrapnel. (If you don?t run the hose into water, you'll get some fruit bitsspewed everywhere.) Alternatively, you can buy what's known as an airlock fromyour local brew store, as well as a five-gallon plastic brew bucket with a holealready in place. Either way, let the vile brew sit for two to four weeks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tavia Morra</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; My first batchof hobo jug wine burbled away in the kitchen for three weeks before we pulledthe top off and decanted it into bottles. I won?t pretend the brew smelledgood, but I'll remind you that I was nineteen and living in my first apartment.The smell of fermenting fruit was far from the worst odor to seep out of thatkitchen. All that mattered was that it worked. I'd crafted an alcoholicbeverage.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; It was slightlysour, a little sweet, and tasted more than a bit like bread mold. But it alsogave off the telltale burn of alcohol as it slid down my throat, and by thethird glass I was no longer sober and thus much less judgmental of the flavor.At the time, all I knew was that I'd cracked the code to being a drunk teenagerwithout any money. It was only years later, while researching this book, that Irealized my young self had inadvertently re-created something very close to thefirst booze our primate ancestors ever swigged.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ancient Alcohol in the</p><p>Animal Kingdom</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Humans aren't the only species with an appreciation foralcohol, or even the only ones with a tendency to take that appreciation toofar. In 2002, a pack of elephants (young and male, of course) tramped into avillage in Assam, India, stole a bunch of wine, and went on a violent, drunkenbender that cost six people their lives. So alcohol problems aren't unique toHomo sapiens, but we're certainly the species that's taken alcohol thefurthest.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; It's easy toimagine some starving ancient human shoveling a handful of decomposing marulafruit down his throat and, a few seconds later, realizing he felt fuckingexcellent. But the story of humankind's introduction to alcohol actually startsmuch earlier, before men or women or anything remotely human ever existed. Ourability to metabolize alcohol, and thus get drunk, originated in some of thevery first primates on earth. The enzyme ADH4 is what lets us (and gorillas andmonkeys) digest alcohol, and the variation of this enzyme that lets our speciesappreciate the ethanol in a whiskey sour first showed up around ten millionyears ago.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; This means therehave been hominids drinking much longer than there have been human beings. Theobvious question is: Why did we hold on to this adaptation? The primates who firststarted using alcohol must've been rewarded for their ability to tolerate itand their desire to seek it out. And reward in that last sentence means "theyhad lots of tiny, drunken animal sex." A casual look at your city's main dragon a Friday night illustrates the most confusing part of this story: Drunkenpeople aren't good at anything but starting fistfights, puking out of carwindows, and having trouble with their erections.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet alcoholis the one drug we know our primate grand-daddies and -mommies were doingmillions of years ago. So have we always loved drinking to excess? The mostlikely answer lies in the most aptly named theory in scientific history . . .</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Drunken Monkey Hypothesis</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>According to the "Drunken Monkey Hypothesis," there's adamn good reason our ancestors started drinking well before the evolutionarytime line's equivalent of five P.M. The Drunken Monkey Hypothesis (yes, that?sthe real name) states that regular drinking carried substantial benefits forour adorable, furry forbearers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; By the timefruit starts fermenting, it's gotten absolutely as ripe as it's going to get.Ripe also means "full of sugar" and thus full of calories. You need a lot ofcalories when your whole day is spent swinging from trees and fleeing fromjaguars. After all, one of alcohol's most well known side effects is the beerbelly. Beer and wine and liquor are all dense with calories. A regular drinkinghabit combined with a regular eating habit leads to a much fatter animal.Humans today aren't huge fans of all those extra calories, but that's onlybecause whole gas stations full of them assault our waistlines on an hourlybasis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the greatchallenges for any species in the wild is simply not starving to death. Whenyou can travel from points A to B only by walking or running and have to huntand gather all your food, you burn a lot more fuel just staying alive. Alcoholguaranteed our ancestors more precious, life-giving calories. The telltalescent of fermentation was an easy way for them to know when a food was at itsmost caloric. Keeping a solid buzz was enough of an advantage that our simiangreat-[X]-grandparents developed noses specifically attuned to the odor ofethanol.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Scientists haveeven gone so far as to confirm that drinking alcohol while eating food makesyou take in more calories than if you just did one after the other. Mixingbooze and food is such a good survival strategy that the only monkeys whofucked enough to pass on their genes were the ones who drank. And yes, there'shard scientific evidence to support that claim.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Frank Wiens andAnnette Zitzmann, animal physiologists from the University of Bayreuth,Germany, noted in 2008 that pen-tailed tree shrews really seemed to prefergetting their calories from fermented fruit nectar than from anything else.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Pen-tailed treeshrews are significant, because in addition to looking like the result of araccoon mating with a pear, they're considered to be the spitting image of thefirst preprimates, genetically speaking. And while these guys have a lot incommon with our earliest ancestors, they also share something with Russiandockworkers; namely, the ability to put away nine or more drinks in a nightwithout feeling it. The pen-tailed tree shrew lives its life like one giant barcrawl, with tree branches as its taps and fermenting palm nectar in lieu ofcraft beer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; That nectar,colonized by naturally occurring air yeasts, can hit 3 to 4 percent alcohol bythe time a shrew starts slurping it up. Nine beers seem like more than a tinylittle rat-monkey should be able to handle without being too fucked-up to avoiddanger. But the pen-tailed tree shrew takes its alcohol like a Yeltsin. Thefact that the jungles of Malaysia aren't filled with drunken shews falling fromthe sky and splattering on the ground is proof that alcohol doesn't affect themquite the same way it affects us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Again,scientists suspect the pen-tailed tree shrew is very close to our early primateancestors. This suggests that our ability to enjoy alcohol's intoxicatingeffects came after our desire to seek out and consume it. We started ourrelationship with alcohol because it made us less likely to starve to death.Over time we gained the ability to stand upright and, eventually, inventNetflix. Somewhere along that time line we also started getting drunk fromalcohol, and not just fat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Today alcohol isthe most widely consumed intoxicant on earth. We spend well over a trilliondollars a year, worldwide, to get our buzz on, and for more sacred purposesthan mere drunkenness; Christian churches across the world use wine torepresent the blood of their god. The ancient Greeks and Romans took theopposite tack, and turned their alcohol into a god, Dionysus. There'sabsolutely no drug on earth that our species has carried further or investedmore creativity into than alcohol. And it all started with fermented palmnectar.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Curious History of Palm</p><p>Trees and Alcohol</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Palm trees are almost enough to make one believe in theexistence of a booze-loving God. The bertam palm, favored by the pen-tailedtree shrew, is essentially a living bar. It secretes a constant flow of nectarinto hundreds of little flowers during the month and a half when its pollen isripening. These flowers are colonized by a special sort of yeast, whichferments the nectar immediately. Small animals, like the tree shrew, are drawnby the smell of sugar and the irresistible allure of an open bar.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Visits to thebertam palm tavern benefit both the fuzzy little alcoholics and the treeitself. The tree shrews get open taps to binge on, and the palm gets a small,drunken army to help spread its pollen far and wide. The arrangement isdizzyingly complex: Yeasts feed off sugars in the nectar, and the brewery-likearoma of those fermenting sugars draws in tree shrews, sloths, and otheranimals. While each bertam palm gives off nectar for only a short time eachyear, individual members of the species are all fertile at different timesthroughout the year, ensuring a regular supply of free sugar beer for thesundry lushes of Malaysia.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The bertam palmisn't the only species of palm tree with a penchant for providing hooch toprimates. Phoenix dactylifera, the date palm tree, is believed to be one of humankind'searliest sources of alcohol. The syrup produced by palm trees is so high insugar, and the plants themselves so friendly to yeast, that each plant isbasically its own self-contained brewery.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Fermenting beerof any worthwhile strength can take two to three weeks, and usually a fair bitlonger. Once tapped and exposed to the air, palm syrup can reach 4 percentalcohol by volume (ABV) in just two hours. In parts of Sri Lanka and Malaysia,a lot of "wine" is still prepared this way today. It's not uncommon for peopleto drink upward of a liter in a day. This palm wine is nearly always consumedwithin a day or so of being fermented (evidently the taste doesn't age well).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I spoke to Dr.Brian Hayden, an archaeologist who's dedicated much of his life to the noblepursuit of studying ancient humans' drinking habits. He pointed out that theease with which palm sap ferments makes it a perfect solution for Muslims whowant to drink and still maintain plausible deniability.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;"I was workingin Northern Africa for a while, and the palm sap they used to sell in themarkets . . . well, Muslims aren't supposed to drink alcohol but this stuff wasfermenting as you bought it. Just bubbling away."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Palm syrup islike the opposite of honey. Humans have used both to make alcoholic beveragessince time immemorial. But honey takes a very long time to ferment: Most meads(honey-based wines) take many months to properly prepare. Even modern quickmead, loaded with other fruits to provide the yeast with more easilyfermentable sugars, takes a good six weeks to brew. Meanwhile, palm syrup turnsinto booze almost immediately, but gets only worse with time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Palm treesclearly want us to get drunk, fast. On the opposite side of things, I imaginebees would be pretty pissed at us if they knew we were turning their precioushoney into bad-decision fuel. But the relative difficulty of fermenting honey,and the dangers involved in acquiring it, made honey wine far more prized byancient drinkers. Palm wine never really took off on a global scale, but youcan probably stroll down the aisles of your local liquor store and find meadtoday.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't help butfeel a little sad at that. We've forgotten our roots. Primates weren'tintroduced to the wonders and terrors of alcohol by honeybees. The bertam palmdidn't exist ten million years ago, but the odds are good that something verymuch like the date palm tree was one of the earth's first bartenders.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And just howwould its drinks have tasted? Well . . .</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>HOW TO: Brew Ur-Booze</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I'm going to answer the question right now, before we getto a recipe. Ur-booze tastes fucking awful. Unless you've got an absolutelyunquenchable sweet tooth or a borderline sexual obsession with the flavor ofcough syrup, you will not enjoy ur-booze. You'll struggle to finish a cup ofthe stuff. But if what I've described sounds good, or if you just hate yourtaste buds, here's what you'll need . . .</p></p><h2>The Dot and the Line: A Romance in Lower Mathematics</h2><p>Once upon a time there was a sensible straight line who was hopelessly in love with a beautiful dot.

To live is to hurt, and we all have the wounds to prove it. Regardless of how we've been hurt, we all face a common question: What should we do with our pain? Should we stoically ignore it? Should we just "get over it"? Should we optimistically hope that everything will work out in the end? <br><br>If we fail to respond appropriately to the wounds that life and relationships inflict, our pain will be wasted; it will numb us or destroy us. But suffering doesn't have to mangle our hearts and rob us of joy. It can, instead, lead us to life--if we know the path to healing.<br><br>Healing is not the resolution of our past; it is the use of our past to draw us into deeper relationship with God and his purposes for our lives. If you're ready to shape a future characterized by love, service, and joy, now is the time to step out onto The Healing Path.</p><p>"Powerful truths which heal the heart are not always easy to grasp, especially when you're hurting.

After living with his unhappy and uptight aunt and uncle for eight years, he decides to run--and not just run away, but run. This is where the myth of Maniac Magee begins, as he changes the lives of a racially divided small town with his amazing and legendary feats.</p><p>Maniac Magee is a folk story about a boy, a very excitable boy. One that can outrun dogs, hit a home run off the best pitcher in the neighborhood, tie a knot no one can undo. "Kid's gotta be a maniac," is what the folks in Two Mills say. It's also the story of how this boy, Jeffrey Lionel "Maniac" Magee, confronts racism in a small town, tries to find a home where there is none and attempts to soothe tensions between rival factions on the tough side of town. Presented as a folk tale, it's the stuff of storytelling. "The history of a kid," says Jerry Spinelli, "is one part fact, two parts legend, and three parts snowball." And for this kid, four parts of fun. <b>Maniac Magee</b> won the 1991 Newbery Medal.Read by S. Ephatha Merkerson<br>Approx. 3.75 hours<br>3 cassettes<br>He wasn?t born with the name Maniac Magee. He came into this world named Jeffrey Lionel Magee, but when his parents died and his life changed, so did his name. And Maniac Magee became a legend. Even today kids talk about how fast he could run; about how he hit an inside-the-park ?frog? homer; how no knot, no matter how snarled, would stay that way once he began to untie it. But the thing Maniac Magee is best known for is what he did for the kids from the East Side and those from the West Side.</p><h2>People Who Eat Darkness: The True Story of a Young Woman Who Vanished from the Streets of Tokyo--and the Evil That Swallowed Her Up</h2><p><p>Lucie Blackman&#x2015;tall, blond, twenty-one years old&#x2015;stepped out into the vastness of Tokyo in the summer of 2000, and disappeared forever.

THE WORLD THE RIGHT WAY ROUND</b><br>&nbsp;<br>Even later, when she found it difficult to see any good in her husband, Lucie&#x2019;s mother, Jane, always acknowledged that Tim Blackman had saved their daughter&#x2019;s life.<br>Lucie had been twenty-one months old at the time, cared for by her father and mother in the cottage they rented in a small village in Sussex. Since infancy, she had been stricken with fierce bouts of tonsillitis, which drove up her temperature and swelled her throat. Her parents sponged her with water to cool her down, but the fevers lingered, and when one had passed another would seize hold within a few weeks. One day, Tim had come home early from work to help Jane care for the needy child. That night, he was awakened by a cry from his wife, who had gone in to look at her.<br>By the time he entered the nursery, Jane was already running downstairs.<br>&#x201c;Lucie was motionless at the bottom of the cot, and she was clammy,&#x201d; Tim said. &#x201c;I picked her out and put her on the floor, and she was turning gray in front of me, just the most sickly, blacky-gray color. Quite clearly the lifeblood wasn&#x2019;t being pumped round her body. I didn&#x2019;t know what to do. I was cuddling her on the floor, and Jane had run down to phone an ambulance. Lucie was completely quiet, wasn&#x2019;t breathing. I tried to force open her mouth. It was tightly shut, but I forced it open with two hands and held it open with the thumb of one hand and put my fingers in and pulled her tongue forward. I didn&#x2019;t know whether I was doing any good or not, but I did it, and then I put her head to one side, and then I breathed into her and then pushed the air out, breathed into her and pushed it out, and she started to breathe on her own again. I was sick with anxiety and worry, and then I saw the pink coming back to her skin, and by that time the ambulance had arrived, and the ambulance blokes were rushing up the tiny, weeny stairs, these great big blokes with all this huge, noisy kit on, big beefy chaps who were as big as the cottage. And they got their stretcher out and strapped her on and carried her downstairs and put her in the back of the ambulance. And after that she was fine.&#x201d;<br>Lucie had experienced a febrile convulsion, a muscle spasm caused by fever and dehydration that had caused her to swallow her own tongue, blocking off her breathing. A few moments longer, and she would have died. &#x201c;I knew at that moment that I could not only have one child,&#x201d; Tim said. &#x201c;I knew. I&#x2019;d thought about it before, when Lucie was born. But at that moment, I knew that if anything had happened to her, and we didn&#x2019;t have any other children, it would be an absolutely terrible disaster.&#x201d;<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>Lucie had been born on September 1, 1978. Her name was from the Latin word for &#x201c;light,&#x201d; and even in adulthood, her mother said, she craved brightness and illumination, and was uncomfortable in the dark, switching on all the bulbs in the house and going to sleep with a lamp turned on in her room.<br>Jane&#x2019;s labor had to be induced, and it lasted sixteen hours. Lucie&#x2019;s head was positioned against her mother&#x2019;s back, a &#x201c;posterior presentation&#x201d; that caused her great pain during the delivery. But the eight-pound baby was healthy, and her parents experienced deep, but complicated, happiness at the birth of their first child. &#x201c;I was delighted, absolutely delighted,&#x201d; said Jane. &#x201c;But I think when you become a mother, you&nbsp;... I just wanted my mother to be there, because I was so proud I&#x2019;d had a baby. But she wasn&#x2019;t there, so it was sad as well.&#x201d;<br>Jane remembered little but sadness from her own childhood. Her adult life, too, had been marked by clusters of crushing, overwhelming loss, which had bred in her a dry, dark humor, alternately self-deprecating and indignantly defensive. She was in her late forties when I first met her, a thin, attractive woman with short dark blond hair and sharp, vigilant features. Her outfits were tidy and demure. Long, delicate lashes ringed her eyes, but the girlishness that they might have suggested was dispelled by a fierce sense of rightness and a scathing intolerance of fools and snobs. Pride and self-pity were at war within Jane. She was like a fox, a stubborn, elegant fox in a navy blue skirt and jacket.<br>Her father had been a manager at the Elstree film studios, and she and her younger brother and sister had grown up in the outer London suburbs, a strict and rather drab middle-class life of homework and good table manners and the annual summer holiday in a gusty English seaside resort. When Jane was twelve, the family moved to south London. Before her first morning at her new school, Jane went in to kiss her mother goodbye and found her asleep after a night of headaches and insomnia. &#x201c;I felt that something awful was going to happen,&#x201d; Jane said. &#x201c;And I said to my father, &#x2018;She&#x2019;s not going to die, is she?&#x2019; and he said, &#x2018;Oh no, don&#x2019;t be silly, of course not.&#x2019; And then I came home from school that day, and she&#x2019;d died. She&#x2019;d had a brain tumor. And from then on my father was distraught. He was broken, a broken man, and I just had to be brave. That was the end of my childhood.&#x201d;<br>Jane&#x2019;s mother was forty years old at the time of her death. &#x201c;My grandmother looked after us during the week, and at weekends it was Daddy,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I remember him just crying all the time.&#x201d; Fifteen months after his wife&#x2019;s death, he married a woman in her mid-twenties. Jane was appalled. &#x201c;But he had three children, and he just couldn&#x2019;t function. It was terrible. The truth is that I can&#x2019;t remember much of my childhood. When you&#x2019;ve had a shock, and been through a time as painful as that, your brain makes you forget.&#x201d;<br>Jane left school at fifteen. She took a secretarial course and found a job at a big advertising agency. When she was nineteen, she traveled to Mallorca with a girlfriend and stayed there for six months, cleaning cars for a living. It was before the age of mass British tourism to Spain, and the Balearic Islands were still a select and exotic destination. The famous Manchester United footballer George Best was a visitor. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t meet him, but I remember seeing him in these bars, surrounded by beauties,&#x201d; said Jane. &#x201c;But I was very sensible, I was very careful. I&#x2019;ve got the word &#x2018;sensible&#x2019; running through my body like a stick of rock. Everyone else might have been swinging but I wasn&#x2019;t. I was just very boring.&#x201d;<br>In Mallorca, Jane&#x2019;s virtue was tested by a young man, a nodding acquaintance, who appeared at her front door one day and attempted to kiss her. &#x201c;I was absolutely mortified, because I hardly knew him, and it was the middle of the afternoon. He was Swedish, I think. I hadn&#x2019;t given him any provocation, and it made me very wary after that. I liked the sun and the sea, I liked being in the outdoors, but I can&#x2019;t say it was a wild time, because I&#x2019;m sensible. I never slept with anyone until I slept with my husband.&#x201d;<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>She was twenty-two when she met Tim, and living with her father and stepmother in Chislehurst in the London borough of Bromley. He was the older brother of a friend, and Jane had already heard all about him. &#x201c;People said to me, &#x2018;That Tim&#x2019;s a right one,&#x2019;&#x201d; she remembered. &#x201c;&#x2018;A right one for the women.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br>Tim had just returned from the south of France, where he had been staying with a French girlfriend. &#x201c;But he started flirting with me anyway, and I gave him one of my icy stares,&#x201d; said Jane. &#x201c;I think I was the first person in his life who hadn&#x2019;t fallen for him just like that, so I was a challenge. But I had no confidence, if I&#x2019;m honest. I had lots of very beautiful girlfriends who had men flocking round them, but at discos I was always the custodian of the handbags. Tim couldn&#x2019;t understand why I hadn&#x2019;t fallen for him hook, line, and sinker, and I couldn&#x2019;t understand why anyone would fancy me, and I think that&#x2019;s why I ended up marrying him.&#x201d; The wedding was eighteen months later, on Tim&#x2019;s twenty-third birthday, July 17, 1976.<br>Tim managed a shoe shop in the nearby town of Orpington, a relic of the dwindling chain of businesses that his father had once owned across the southeast. But the shop failed, and Tim found himself claiming the dole for six months. He ended up supporting his young family with odd jobs for friends and as a freelance painter and decorator. &#x201c;We were living hand to mouth,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;They were very tricky, very tricky times in the early 1980s, and we didn&#x2019;t know where the next fifty pounds was coming from. But we were in this lovely place with our baby, this Laura Ashley&#x2013;style cottage, and it was a very beautiful life. I loved that time when Lucie was little.&#x201d;<br>In May 1980, less than two years after the first baby, Jane gave birth to Sophie, and, three years after that, to Rupert. Tim found a business partner and moved from decorating into property development; in 1982 the family moved a few miles north to the genteel commuter town of Sevenoaks, in Kent. Here, their period of hardship at an end, Jane was able to create for her own family the childhood she had always wanted for herself, an idyll of flowers and pretty dresses and the laughter of little children.<br>The house where they lived, which Jane christened Daisy Cottage, overlooked a private prep school&#x2014;Granville School, or <i>the</i> Granville School, as it insisted on being known. It was the fulfillment of all her fantasies, a place of such self-conscious tweeness that everyone who went there remembers it with a smile. The girls, as young as three years old, wore a uniform of blue-checked dresses and gray woolly bobble hats; at the spring festival, t...</p><h2>Pull Up a Chair: The Vin Scully Story</h2><p>In 1950, Vin Scully broadcast his first major league baseball game for the then&#x2013;Brooklyn Dodgers. Nearly sixty years later he still invites a listener to &#x201c;pull up a chair,&#x201d; completing a record fifty-ninth consecutive year of play-by-play. Recruited and mentored by the legendary Red Barber, the New York&#x2013;born Scully moved with the Dodgers to Los Angeles in early 1958. His instantly recognizable voice has described players from Duke Snider to Orel Hershiser to Manny Ramirez, with hundreds in between.At one time or another, Scully has aired NBC Television&#x2019;s Game of the Week, twelve All-Star Games, eighteen no-hitters, twenty-five World Series, and network football, golf, and tennis. He has made every sportscasting Hall of Fame; received a Lifetime Emmy Achievement award and a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame; and been voted &#x201c;most memorable [L.A. Dodgers] franchise personality.&#x201d; In 2000, the American Sportscasters Association named Scully the Sportscaster of the 20th Century.The first biography of Vin Scully is long overdue. Curt Smith&#x2015;to <i>USA Today</i>, &#x201c;The voice of authority on baseball broadcasting&#x201d;&#x2015;is the ideal man to write it. Scully opens each broadcast by wishing listeners, &#x201c;A very pleasant good afternoon.&#x201d; <i>Pull Up a Chair</i> will provide a reader with the same.</p><p><b>Curt Smith</b> is the author of seventeen books, including the classic history of baseball broadcasting, <i>Voices of The Game</i>. His other books include: <i>Pull Up a Chair: The Vin Scully Story </i>(Potomac Books, 2009), <i>Mercy! A Celebration of Fenway Park&#x2019;s Centennial</i>&nbsp;(Potomac Books, 2012), and most recently, <i>George H. W. Bush: Character at the Core</i> (Potomac Books, 2014). Smith is a senior lecturer of English at the University of Rochester, a Gate House Media columnist, and a contributor to publications from <i>Newsweek</i> to the <i>New York Times</i>. The host of the &#x201c;Voices of The Game&#x201d; series at the Smithsonian Institution and the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, he has been named to the Judson Welliver Society of former presidential speechwriters.Vin Scully&#39;s career as the voice of the Dodgers--from Brooklyn to Los Angeles--covers more than half-a-century. The award-winning, often-emulated announcer, in his gentle way, has been a consistent companion for generations of baseball fans. Smith&#39;s book is a career-encompassing look at Scully and other broadcasters over the years. His writing style can be a bit jarring at times, but by the end you come to realize a bit more about the venerable broadcaster. Don Leslie is as gentle in his narration as Scully is in his profession. He doesn&#39;t try to imitate Scully and only subtly mimics a few voices. Mostly, he, too, is a companion, guiding the listener through the story.

In the process, he stumbles upon the Inner Self. While lucid (consciously aware) in the dream state and able to act and interact with dream figures, objects, and settings, dream expert Robert Waggoner experienced something transformative and unexpected. He was able to interact consciously with the dream observer -- the apparent Inner Self -- within the dream. At first this seemed shocking, even impossible, since psychology normally alludes to such theoretical inner aspects as the Subliminal Self, the Center, the Internal Self-Helper in vague and theoretical ways. Waggoner came to realize, however, that aware interaction with the Inner Self was not only possible, but actual and highly inspiring. He concluded that while aware in the dream state, one has both a psychological tool and a platform from which to understand dreaming and the larger picture of man&#39;s psyche as well. Waggoner proposes 5 stages of lucid dreaming and guides readers through them, offering advice for those who have never experienced the lucid dream state and suggestions for how experienced lucid dreamers can advance to a new level. Lucid Dreaming offers exciting insights and vivid illustrations that will intrigue not only avid dreamworkers but anyone who is interested in consciousness, identity, and the definition of reality.</p><p>Robert Waggoner is President-Elect of the International Association for the Study of Dreams (IASD) and a summa cum laude graduate of Drake University with a degree in psychology. He is also the co­founder and editor of the online journal, The Lucid Dream Exchange (dreaminglucid.com), the only ongoing publication devoted speci?cally to lucid dreaming. He is a frequent speaker at national and international dream conferences.In this remarkable book, Robert Waggoner has brought lucid dreaming to a level that is simultaneously higher and deeper than any previous explorer has taken the topic. Both autobiographical and historical, theoretical and practical, psychodynamic and transpersonal, as well as adventurous and cautionary, Lucid Dreaming offers its readers instructions and insights that they will find nowhere else in the literature. They will learn how they can become awake and aware while asleep, and how this talent can change their lives. --Stanley Krippner, Ph.D., Professor of Psychology, Saybrook Graduate School and Research Center, San Francisco, Coauthor of Extraordinary Dreams and How To Work With Them<br><br>Lucid Dreaming IS a gateway to the Inner Self. Robert Waggoner s unique storytelling style is compelling reading an impressive exploration of the subject. The work is scholarly, fascinating, and, most of all, practical. --Christine Lemley, Executive Producer, DREAMTIME Series, WFYI/PBS-TV Indianapolis<br><br>Robert Waggoner admirably fulfills his aim of bringing lucidity to lucid dreaming. His book is distinguished by its wealth of first-hand experience, and his clear recognition that, instead of seeking to control and manipulate our dreams, we should use the gift of lucidity to navigate a deeper reality and grow into connection with a deeper and wiser self. He offers practical techniques and fascinating travelers tales to encourage us to experiment with interactive and precognitive dreaming and to explore the process of reality creation inside the dream matrix. This is an invitation to high adventure. --Robert Moss, Author of Conscious Dreaming and The Three ONLY Things: Tapping the Power of Dreams, Coincidence, and Imagination</p><h2>The Story of George Washington Carver (Scholastic Biography)</h2><p>Relates the early life, struggles, and achievements of the Black botanist who became a pioneer in agricultural research</p><p>Eva Moore has been writing and editing children's books for more than forty years.

Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, voluminous notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.<br></p><p>In this influential two-volume edition, first published in 1902, the Scottish classicist James Adam examines the text of Plato&#39;s monumental political and philosophical dialogue. Volume 2 focuses on Books 6-10, which discuss the place of the philosopher and questions of governance.<p>This celebrated philosophical work of the fourth century B.C. contemplates the elements of an ideal state, serving as the forerunner for such other classics of political thought as Cicero's <i>De Republica</i>, St. Augustine's <i>City of God</i>, and Thomas More's <i>Utopia</i>.<br>Written in the form of a dialog in which Socrates questions his students and fellow citizens, <i>The Republic</i> concerns itself chiefly with the question, "What is justice?" as well as Plato's theory of ideas and his conception of the philosopher's role in society. To explore the latter, he invents the allegory of the cave to illustrate his notion that ordinary men are like prisoners in a cave, observing only the shadows of things, while philosophers are those who venture outside the cave and see things as they really are, and whose task it is to return to the cave and tell the truth about what they have seen. This dynamic metaphor expresses at once the eternal conflict between the world of the senses (the cave) and the world of ideas (the world outside the cave), and the philosopher's role as mediator between the two.</p><p></p></p><h2>Getting to Know ArcGIS Desktop</h2><p><p><em>Getting to Know ArcGIS</em>, fourth edition, is a comprehensive introduction to the features and tools of ArcGIS for Desktop.

Brands, as well as his personal life.</b><br><br>When was the last time you told your colleagues how much you value them? It sounds like a trivial thing in the middle of a busy work day. But as Novak discovered during his years as a hard charging executive, there&#x2019;s nothing trivial about recognition. It can make a life-or-death difference to any organization, when people see that someone important really notices and appreciates their contributions. <br>&nbsp;<br>The story of <i>O Great One</i>! opens when Jeff Johnson becomes the third-generation CEO of his family business, after the sudden death of his father. The Happy Face Toy Company had many hits in the 1950s and 60s, including Crazy Paste, but its results have been declining for more than a decade. The board has given Jeff just one year to turn the business around, or else they&#x2019;ll have to sell it to the highest bidder. <br>&nbsp;<br>As Jeff races to save his family&#x2019;s legacy by getting the company back on track, he meets downtrodden factory workers and an uninspired executive team. Then a birthday gift from his grandson gives Jeff an important insight into why Happy Face lost its culture of innovation and excitement, along with its profitability. He comes up with an idea that seems crazy... But is it crazy enough to work?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Whether you&#x2019;re trying to lead a small department, a Fortune 500 company, a non-profit, or your own family, the story and lessons of <i>O Great One!</i> can help you make everyone around you happier and more effective.</p></p><p><p><b>David Novak</b>&nbsp;is the co-founder and former CEO of Yum! Brands. He has been recognized as &#x201c;CEO of the Year&#x201d; by <i>Chief Executive</i>, one of the &#x201c;30 Best CEOs&#x201d; by <i>Barron&#x2019;s</i>, one of the &#x201c;Top People in Business&#x201d; by <i>Fortune,</i> and one of the &#x201c;100 Best Performing CEOs in the World&#x201d; by <i>Harvard Business Review</i>. He created Lead2Feed (the largest privately funded leadership service program in middle schools and high schools) and won the Horatio Alger Award for his commitment to philanthropy and higher education. He is the author of two acclaimed books,&nbsp;<i>The Education of an Accidental CEO&nbsp;</i>and the&nbsp;<i>New York</i>&nbsp;<i>Times&nbsp;</i>bestseller <i>Taking People With You.&nbsp;</i>He is currently launching a new company, OGO Enterprises.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Christa Bourg</b> is a writer, editor, and book packager who lives in Los Angeles.</p><b>Introduction<br>O Great One!: The Story</b><br>&nbsp;<br>OGO&#x2014;short for O Great One&#x2014; is the name my grandkids have called me ever since they could talk. It may sound over the top to some, but it came about because when my daughter was pregnant with her first child, I didn&#x2019;t want to be called grandpa, poppy, or any of the usual names. I wanted something a bit more fun and different. How OGO finally came to me is something I will tell in the coming story, but over the years, people always laughed when they heard the name. It was also easy for my grandkids to say, so it stuck.<br>&nbsp;<br>Since then, OGO has become much, much more than just a nickname my family calls me. It has come to represent something I&#x2019;ve practiced and encouraged throughout my entire life: the awesome power of recognition.<br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>O Great One! </i>is a story about that powerful force. It centers on a guy named Jeff Johnson, who becomes CEO of the Happy Face Toy Company, an organization that&#x2019;s in dire shape when he arrives. Because he&#x2019;s new to the job, and even new to the industry, he&#x2019;s left scrambling and not sure what to do about the company&#x2019;s ever- sinking sales. That is, until a surprise gift from his grandson helps him discover that in his organization, recognition has been the missing ingredient that will turn things around&#x2014; for him, for his team, and for Happy Face Toys as a whole.<br>&nbsp;<br>I wanted to tell this story because I&#x2019;ve seen how impactful recognition can be. I&#x2019;ve also witnessed how devastating it can be when it&#x2019;s absent from the life of an individual, a team, and even a large organization. Often people think of recognition as the kind of fluffy feel- good stuff that businesses talk about to try to make their employees happy. But if used right, it does a whole lot more than that. Simply put: if you give people the recognition they&#x2019;ve <i>earned, </i>if you show <i>genuine </i>appreciation and acknowledge the unique things people have to offer, then you will drive real results. And at the same time, you will lift the spirits of everyone involved. It really does feel good to receive recognition, and it feels every bit as good to give it&#x2014; often even better.<br>&nbsp;<br>Considering that recognition can have such a hugely positive effect, it&#x2019;s amazing to me that it&#x2019;s still vastly underused in business, and also in life. I think that&#x2019;s a crime. As you&#x2019;ll see in this story, making use of recognition is not hard, it&#x2019;s not expensive, and you don&#x2019;t need an MBA or even a position of authority to do it.<br>&nbsp;<br>I know this is true because I&#x2019;ve seen it in action as my team and I built Yum! Brands into one of the world&#x2019;s largest restaurant companies. It operates in 125 countries and employs nearly 1.5 million people. So I&#x2019;ve not only seen recognition work, I&#x2019;ve also seen it work on a grand scale<br>with people from different walks of life all around the world. In fact, the story you are about to read is based on real-world experiences I&#x2019;ve had throughout my career as the leader of this mammoth organization.<br>&nbsp;<br>This story comes from my personal experience, but that doesn&#x2019;t mean you have to be the leader of a big company to reap the benefits. Recognition works for the leader of a small team just as well as it does for the chairman of a large enterprise. It works for an individual who isn&#x2019;t in a leadership position at all. It works outside of business for parents, teachers, community groups, sports teams, and everyone else. The important thing to understand about recognition is that it&#x2019;s simply good for people&#x2014; <i>all</i> <i>people</i>&#x2014; no matter who they are, what they do, or where they come from.<br>&nbsp;<br>If there&#x2019;s one message I hope you will take away from this book it&#x2019;s that no matter who you are or what you do, <i>you </i>have the power to use recognition to make a difference in people&#x2019;s lives each and every day. You have the power to show people that someone is watching, that someone cares, and that what they do really matters. You have the power to help individuals, teams, and organizations reach their potential. Whether you&#x2019;re trying to affect the bottom line of a Fortune 500 company or the quality of life of your children, the prescription is the same. If you use recognition on a regular basis, you can inspire people to do great things. And the personal satisfaction you&#x2019;ll receive as a result, when you see others reach their full potential with your help . . . well, that&#x2019;s when the real magic kicks in.<br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>O Great One! </i>is for anyone who wants to motivate people, get results, and feed the soul. And really, who wouldn&#x2019;t want to do all that? Especially because it all comes down to something that&#x2019;s relatively simple to implement and use.<br>&nbsp;<br>As far as I&#x2019;m concerned, the only real question is: <i>Why aren&#x2019;t people using recognition more?</i></p><h2>On the Threshold of Transformation: Daily Meditations for Men</h2><p>For men, pain is very real.<br> So is the power to transform it.In one of the opening meditations of this book, male spirituality expert Richard Rohr writes, &#x201c;We need to fail, to fall, to jump into the central mystery of our own existence, or we&#x2019;ll have no way of finding our true path.&#x201d; Those words serve as the starting point for a potentially transformative experience, one in which men come to grips with the fact that some form of suffering or letting go is essential to achieving wholeness, holiness, and happiness.<br> With nearly every man dealing with some form of hurt in his life, On the Threshold of Transformation acknowledges the pain and deals with it directly and redemptively. While much of our culture today would have us believe that failure and suffering are inherently bad, Fr. Rohr helps men see that pain&#x2014;in whatever form it takes&#x2014;is a primary doorway through which they can pass to reach their authentic, best selves, which is where they will truly encounter God.<br> Ultimately, this book of 366 daily meditations helps men learn how to transform their pain so they don&#x2019;t pass it on. With Fr. Rohr as their guide, the path to male spiritual transformation can be found and followed.</p><p><p>365 meditations to help men navigate their way to greater wholeness and holiness</p><p>In one of the opening meditations of On the Threshold of Transformation, male spirituality expert Richard Rohr writes, &#x201c;We need to fail, to fall, to jump into the central mystery of our own existence, or we&#x2019;ll have no way of finding our true path.&#x201d; Those words summarize the central idea of all 365 meditations in this daily guide for men: that wholeness and holiness can be found only through some form of suffering or letting go.<br> With nearly every man dealing with some form of darkness&#x2014;of hurt&#x2014;in his life, this book readily acknowledges the pain and deals with it directly, unapologetically, and redemptively. While much of our culture today would have us believe that failure and suffering are inherently bad, Fr. Rohr helps men see that pain&#x2014;in whatever form it takes&#x2014;is inevitably the only doorway through which they can pass to reach their authentic, best selves, which is where they will truly encounter God.<br> Ultimately this book helps men, over the manageable timeline of one year, learn how to transform their pain so they don&#x2019;t transmit it. The meditations in this book clearly reveal that neither taking a pass on pain nor passing pain along to others is an option; to become a better man, in the deepest sense of that phrase, requires that each man deal with his own darkness and allow that darkness to give way to total transformation.<br> &nbsp;</p>Richard Rohr is a Franciscan priest and the founder of the Center for Action and Contemplation in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

This is their story, told in full for the first time&#x2014;a searing and unforgettable chronicle of terror, courage, defiance, survival, and the power of friendship. Caroline Moorehead, a distinguished biographer, human rights journalist, and the author of <em>Dancing to the Precipice</em> and <em>Human Cargo</em>, brings to life an extraordinary story that readers of Mitchell Zuckoff&#x2019;s <em>Lost in Shangri-La</em>, Erik Larson&#x2019;s <em>In the Garden of Beasts</em>, and Laura Hillenbrand&#x2019;s <em>Unbroken</em> will find an essential addition to our retelling of the history of World War II&#x2014;a riveting, rediscovered story of courageous women who sacrificed everything to combat the march of evil across the world.</p></p><p><p>They were teachers, students, chemists, writers, and housewives; a singer at the Paris Opera; a midwife; a dental surgeon. They distributed anti-Nazi leaflets, printed subversive newspapers, hid resisters, secreted Jews to safety, transported weapons, and conveyed clandestine messages. The youngest was a schoolgirl of sixteen, who scrawled "V" (for victory) on the walls of her lyc�e; the eldest, a farmer's wife in her sixties who harbored escaped Allied airmen. Strangers to one another, hailing from villages and cities across France&#x2014;230 brave women united in defiance of their Nazi occupiers&#x2014;they were eventually hunted down by the Gestapo. Separated from home and loved ones, imprisoned in a fort outside Paris, they found solace and strength in their deep affection and camaraderie.</p><p>In January 1943, they were sent to their final destination: Auschwitz. Only forty-nine would return to France.</p><p>Drawing on interviews with these women and their families, and on documents in German, French, and Polish archives, <em>A Train in Winter</em> is a remarkable account of the extraordinary courage of ordinary people&#x2014;a story of bravery, survival, and the enduring power of female friendship.</p><p>Caroline Moorehead is the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>Village of Secrets: Defying the Nazis in Vichy France</em>; <em>A Train in Winter: An Extraordinary Story of Women, Friendship, and Resistance in Occupied France</em>; and <em>Human Cargo: A Journey Among Refugees</em>, which was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award.

They used a language composed of gestures made almost entirely with the hands and fingers, probably the most highly developed gesture language to be found in any part of the world.<br>With this book, you will find it simple to use this language, which the author learned in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, principally from Sioux Indians in Wyoming. Drawings and short descriptions make clear the proper positions and motions of the hands to convey the meaning of over 870 alphabetically arranged common words &#x2014; hungry, camp, evening, angry, fire, laugh, owl, cat, many times, brave, cold, heart, rain, spotted, together, river, etc. The words are then used in sample sentences. There are also brief sections on the pictography and ideography of the Sioux and Ojibway tribes, and on smoke signals.<br>This is a book for anyone who wants to learn or teach Indian sign language &#x2014; scouts, school teachers, camp counselors, scout leaders, parents, linguists, and students of Indian culture. To help counselors and teachers, the last chapters give instructions on how to conduct the Indian ceremony for opening a council fire, an Indian initiation ceremony, and suggestions for sign language tests and exercises.</p><p>Text: English, French, German</p><h2>Many Moons</h2><p>A wise tale of a little princess who wanted the moon and got it. &#x201c;Grown-ups themselves will find the book hilariously funny. . . .

But most of us have never learned how to think effectively. I&#x2019;m not talking about IQ or other measures of intelligence, which matter in their own way, of course. I&#x2019;m talking about thinking as a learned skill. We don&#x2019;t teach thinking in schools, and you can see the results of that nearly every day. If you use social media, or you make the mistake of paying attention to other people&#x2019;s opinions in any form, you&#x2019;re probably seeing a lot of absurd and unproductive reasoning that I call loserthink. <br><br> Loserthink isn&#x2019;t about being dumb, and it isn&#x2019;t about being underinformed. Loserthink is about unproductive ways of thinking. You can be smart and well informed while at the same time being a flagrant loserthinker. That is not only possible; it&#x2019;s the normal situation. My observation, after several decades on this planet, is that clear thinking is somewhat rare. And there&#x2019;s a reason for that. No matter how smart you are, if you don&#x2019;t have experience across multiple domains, you&#x2019;re probably not equipped with the most productive ways of thinking. <br><br> For example, a trained engineer learns a certain way of thinking about the world that overlaps but is different from how a lawyer, a philosopher, or an economist thinks. Having any one of those skill sets puts you way ahead in understanding the world and thinking about it productively. But unless you have sampled the thinking techniques across different fields, you are missing a lot. And again, to be super clear, I am not talking about the facts one learns in those disciplines. I am only talking about the techniques of thinking that students of those fields pick up during the process of learning. <br><br> The good news is that you don&#x2019;t need to master the fields of engineering, science, economics, philosophy, law, or any other field in order to learn the basics of how to think the way experts in those areas think. <br><br> For example, if you didn&#x2019;t know what the concept of sunk costs is all about, I could explain it in thirty seconds and you would fully understand it. <br><br> Sunk costs: Money you already spent shouldn&#x2019;t influence your decision about what to do next, but for psychological reasons, it often does. <br><br> I wrote this book to get you acquainted with (or remind you of) the most productive thinking techniques borrowed from multiple domains. Collectively, they will help you avoid unproductive loserthink.<br><br></p></p><h2>Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco</h2><p><p>&#x201c;One of the finest, most compelling accounts of what happened to corporate America and Wall Street in the 1980&#x2019;s.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>New York Times Book Review</i><br><br></p><p>A #1 <i>New York Times </i>bestseller and arguably the best business narrative ever written, <i>Barbarians at the Gate </i>is the classic account of the fall of RJR Nabisco. An enduring masterpiece of investigative journalism by Bryan Burrough and John Helyar, it includes a new afterword by the authors that brings this remarkable story of greed and double-dealings up to date twenty years after the famed deal. The <i>Los Angeles Times</i> calls <i>Barbarians at the Gate</i>, &#x201c;Superlative.&#x201d; The <i>Chicago Tribune</i> raves, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s hard to imagine a better story...and it&#x2019;s hard to imagine a better account.&#x201d; And in an era of spectacular business crashes and federal bailouts, it still stands as a valuable cautionary tale that must be heeded.</p></p><p><p>A book that stormed both the bestseller list and the public imagination, a book that created a genre of its own, and a book that gets at the heart of Wall Street and the '80s culture it helped define, <em>Barbarians at the Gate</em> has emerged twenty years after the tumultuous deal it so brilliantly recounts as a modern classic&#x2014;a masterpiece of investigatory journalism and a rollicking book of corporate derring-do and financial swordsmanship.</p><p>The fight to control RJR Nabisco during October and November of 1988 was more than just the largest takeover in Wall Street history. Marked by brazen displays of ego not seen in American business for decades, it became the high point of a new gilded age and its repercussions are still being felt. The tale remains the ultimate story of greed and glory&#x2014;a story and a cast of characters that determined the course of global business and redefined how deals would be done and fortunes made in the decades to come.</p><p><em>Barbarians at the Gate</em> is the gripping account of these two frenzied months, of deal makers and publicity flaks, of an old-line industrial powerhouse (home of such familiar products a Oreos and Camels) that became the victim of the ruthless and rapacious style of finance in the 1980s. As reporters for <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, Burrough and Helyar had extensive access to all the characters in this drama. They take the reader behind the scenes at strategy meetings and society dinners, into boardrooms and bedrooms, providing an unprecedentedly detailed look at how financial operations at the highest levels are conducted but also a richly textured social history of wealth at the twilight of the Reagan era.</p><p>At the center of the huge power struggle is RJR Nabisco's president, the high-living Ross Johnson. It's his secret plan to buy out the company that sets the frenzy in motion, attracting the country's leading takeover players: Henry Kravis, the legendary leveraged-buyout king whose entry into the fray sets off an acquisitive commotion; Peter Cohen, CEO of Shearson Lehman Hutton and Johnson's partner, who needs a victory to propel his company to an unchallenged leadership in the lucrative mergers and acquisitions field; the fiercely independent Ted Forstmann, motivated as much by honor as by his rage at the corruption he sees taking over the business he cherishes; Jim Maher and his ragtag team, struggling to regain credibility for the decimated ranks at First Boston; and an army of desperate bankers, lawyers, and accountants, all drawn inexorably to the greatest prize of their careers&#x2014;and one of the greatest prizes in the history of American business.</p><p>Written with the bravado of a novel and researched with the diligence of a sweeping cultural history, <em>Barbarians at the Gate</em> is present at the front line of every battle of the campaign. Here is the unforgettable story of that takeover in all its brutality. In a new afterword specially commissioned for the story's 20th anniversary, Burrough and Helyar return to visit the heroes and villains of this epic story, tracing the fallout of the deal, charting the subsequent success and failure of those involved, and addressing the incredible impact this story&#x2014;and the book itself&#x2014;made on the world.</p><p>Bryan Burrough is a special correspondent at <em>Vanity Fair</em> and the author of five books.</p><br><br><p>John Helyar is a columnist for <em>Bloomberg News</em>.

Yet they wish they could. In this insightful and alternately amusing guide, Professor Mark Yarbrough shows how easy and gratifying it is to unlock the hidden truths of God's Word and to discover a world where reading the Bible doesn't just satisfy our curiosity, but changes our life. <br><br> To do this, the reader will step into the seminary classroom and observe the practical principles-the tricks of the trade-for becoming a more effective student of the Bible. But Yarbrough has made sure that his writing style and general approach will be appealing to both academic students and those involved in lay-level Bible study. <br><br> Real life is whacky and in-your-face. Studying Scripture should be too.</p><p>Mark M. Yarbrough serves as Vice President for Academic Affairs and Academic Dean, and as a professor in the Bible Exposition at Dallas Theological Seminary - as well as part of the pastoral teaching team at Centerpoint Church in Mesquite, Texas. A native Texan, Mark is a graduate of Dallas Christian College (DCC) and Dallas Theological Seminary (DTS). Prior to joining the faculty and administration of DTS in 2001, he served in several ministries. For 10 years he served at a church in southeast Dallas as youth and preaching pastor. After graduating from DTS, he spent several years at DCC, serving in the Bible department and part of the presidential leadership team. After transitioning to DTS and upon the completion of his Ph.D., he was appointed as Vice President for Communications. That role included an active engagement with the local and national media.

He has been married to Jennifer, his high school sweetheart, for over 20 years. They reside just east of Downtown Dallas in Forney, Texas and have four children: Kayla, Jacob, Kayci, and Joseph.Following in the footsteps of Howard Hendricks, Mark Yarbrough's insightful, relevant, and many times humorous book is a Kingdom tool for comprehending-and applying-God's great Word.

As a teenager Debi was actively involved in witnessing and ministering to the sick and wounded veterans. About twenty five years ago, Debi and her husband Mike moved to rural Tennessee where they continued in the work by holding Bible studies in local homes, which eventually led to regular meetings of the local body of believers, and the starting of the prison ministry where Mike ministered every Saturday for twenty three years. God eventually led Mike and Debi into the ministry of writing on child training and family relationships, which they now feel is their life s work and calling. The result of this work led to the formation of No Greater Joy Ministries (NGJ), a 501(c)(3). To date over 1,200,000 of her books have been sold in over ten languages.

These three remarkable men-of-arms who rose from the gruesome hell of the First World War to become the finest generals of their generation during World War II redefined America's ideas of military leadership and brought forth a new generation of American soldier. Their efforts revealed to the world the grit and determination that would become synonymous with America in the post-war years.<br>&nbsp;<br> Filled with novel-worthy twists and turns, and set against the backdrop of the most dramatic moments of the twentieth century, <i>The Generals</i> is a powerful, action-packed book filled with marvelous surprises and insights into the lives of America's most celebrated warriors.</p><p>Winston Groom is the beloved author of 14 previous books, including <i>Forrest Gump</i>; <i>The Aviators</i>; <i>Conversations with the Enemy</i> (nominated for a Pulitzer Prize); <i>1942: The Year That Tried Men's Souls</i>; <i>Vicksburg, 1863</i>; and <i>Shiloh, 1862</i>.

And the One who began the Story is at work today, in your life, in the midst of your meetings and bills and family activities that make the days rush by and blur together. In these pages Bobby Gross opens to you--and opens you to--the liturgical year, helping you <em>inhabit</em> God's Story every day. <ul><li>Remembering God's work, Christ's death and resurrection, and the Spirit's coming will change you, drawing you into deeper intimacy with God and pointing your attention to the work of the Father, Son and Spirit right now, in and around you.</li><li>You'll be reminded daily that your life is bigger than just you, that you are part of God's huge plan that started before time and will continue into eternity.</li></ul> Whether you're familiar or unfamiliar with following the liturgical year, this book makes it easy to do, offering here the significance and history of each season, ideas for living out God's Story in your own life, and devotions that follow the church calendar for each day of the year. "The power that overshadowed Mary and raised Jesus from the dead also guarantees the final redemption of all things in him; that same power is at work in us now," Gross writes. "Keeping liturgical time, making it sacred, opens us further to this power as, year after year, we rehearse the Story of God--<em>remembering</em> with gratitude, <em>anticipating</em> with hope--and over time live more deeply the Story of our lives."</p><p>&#34;Only occasionally does a book come along which will become a steady companion in my own journey of discipleship.?Bobby Gross has engagingly written that kind of book.?It both points the way to a fuller understanding of God&#39;s great story in Christ, and simultaneously provides guidance and tools to help me weave my life into God&#39;s story as I enter the steady rhythms of the Christian calendar.?I have never seen a book quite like this.&#34;Bobby Gross is director of Graduate and Faculty Ministries for InterVarsity Christian Fellowship (IVCF).

Twain&#x2019;s encounters with tarantulas and donkeys, vigilantes and volcanoes, even Brigham Young, the Mormon leader, come to life with his inimitable mixture of reporting, social satire, and rollicking tall tales.<br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> With an Introduction by Elizabeth Frank*<br> And a New Afterword by Mark Dawidziak</p><p>There is no nicer surprise for a reader than to discover that an acknowledged classic really does deliver the goods. Mark Twain's <i>Roughing It</i> is just such a book. The adventure tale is a delight from start to finish and is just as engrossing today as it was 125 years ago when it first appeared. <p> <i>Roughing It</i> tells the true-ish escapades of Twain in the American West. Although he clearly "speaks with forked tongue," <i>Roughing It</i> is informative as well as humorous. From stagecoach travel to the etiquette of prospecting, the modern reader gains considerable insight into that much-fictionalized time and place. Do you know about sagebrush, for example? </p><blockquote> Sage-brush is very fair fuel, but as a vegetable it is a distinguished failure. Nothing can abide the taste of it but the jackass and his illegitimate child, the mule. But their testimony to its nutritiousness is worth nothing, for they will eat pine knots, or anthracite coal, or brass filings, or lead pipe, or old bottles, or anything that comes handy, and then go off looking as grateful as if they had had oysters for dinner. </blockquote> <i>Roughing It</i> is informally structured around the narrator's attempts to strike it rich. He meets a motley, colorful crew in the process; many mishaps occur, and it shouldn't surprise you that Twain does not emerge a man of means. But he withstands it all in such a relentless good humor that his misfortune inspires laughter. <i>Roughing It</i> is wonderful entertainment and reminds you how funny the world can be--even its grimmer districts--when you're traveling with the right writer.12 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>A Fortune for Your Disaster</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;When an author&#x2019;s unmitigated brilliance shows up on every page, it&#x2019;s tempting to skip a description and just say, Read this! Such is the case with this breathlessly powerful, deceptively breezy book of poetry.&#x201d; &#x2015;<em>Booklist</em>, Starred Review</strong></p> In his much-anticipated follow-up to&nbsp;<em>The Crown Ain't Worth Much</em>, poet, essayist, biographer, and music critic Hanif Abdurraqib has written a book of poems about how one rebuilds oneself after a heartbreak, the kind that renders them a different version of themselves than the one they knew. It's a book about a mother's death, and admitting that Michael Jordan pushed off, about forgiveness, and how none of the author's black friends wanted to listen to "Don't Stop Believin'." It's about wrestling with histories, personal and shared. Abdurraqib uses touchstones from the world outside&#x2015;from Marvin Gaye to Nikola Tesla to his neighbor's dogs&#x2015;to create a mirror, inside of which every angle presents a new possibility.</p><p>Hanif Abdurraqib is a poet, essayist. and cultural critic from Columbus, Ohio. His first poetry collection, The Crown Ain&#39;t Worth Much, was named a finalist for the Eric Hoffer Book Prize and was nominated for a Hurston-Wright Legacy Award. His collection of essays, They Can&#39;t Kill Us Until They Kill Us, was named a best book of 2017 by Buzzfeed, Esquire, NPR, Oprah Magazine, and Pitchfork, among others. His most recent book, a New York Times bestseller, is Go Ahead in the Rain, a biography of A Tribe Called Quest.&#x201c;It's brilliant and dizzying, but no matter how lost you get within its powerful lines, you'll finish this book having a stronger sense of orientation within this world, and within yourself.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>NYLON</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;This resonant second collection from cultural critic, essayist, and poet Abdurraqib grapples with physical and emotional acts of violence and their political context.&nbsp;&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Publishers Weekly (Starred Review)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s real energy in this book, and there&#x2019;s also a compelling sense of love, longing, and loss. ... A deft collection.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Devastatingly beautiful ... a book born of blood, of heartache, of isolation, of history, of forging new paths and new endings. ... a rare accomplishment of poetic language, of music, of heart, of resilience.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Nashville Review</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;What Abdurraqib has built here is a dazzling tapestry of poems.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>American Microreviews &amp; Interviews</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;This is the kind of poetic stand that helps us stay alive, even in our late empire that moves to its own truth and dread. Abdurraqib is&nbsp;the voice to live with.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Ilya Kaminsky</strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>A Fortune for Your Disaster</em> proves that, if you pay attention, Black people have defined and still define themselves for themselves amid roses and dandelions, cardinals and violets, the blues of music and police uniforms, prayer and swagger, Kehinde Wiley paintings and too many funerals, the streets of bleak cities and the fraught histories of "a kill or be killed / nation." The disaster is not us or ours but what we endure, forced and as a matter of course, whether our presence is acknowledged or not, on our terms or not. As death insists on invading our lives, we keep making more and more beauty in order to survive it. If "memory is a field / with endless graves" as disasters of the past bleed relentlessly into present and thus menace the future, Hanif Abdurraquib&#x2019;s poems encompass the quiet and often lonely genius of our creativity as a means to "imagine that anything / can become us." The beauty of our excellence is soundtracked by love and violence, the "agony threaded together by the same chorus" of what we fight for and how we continue, visibly or secretly garlanded, heralded by our own painfully ecstatic voices "making [our] own ending." The fortune is us and it is ours. With a music as richly profound as we are, Abdurraquib makes it undeniably so.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Khadijah Queen</strong></p><h2>Writing about Writing</h2><p><p>Since its initial publication, <em>Writing about Writing</em> has empowered tens of thousands of students to investigate assumptions about writing and to explore how writing works. It does so by making writing itself the subject of inquiry. Unique to Wardle and Downs&#x2019; approach, the text presents &#x201c;threshold concepts&#x201d; about writing&#x2015;central ideas that writers need to understand in order to progress. As they come to a deeper understanding of these threshold concepts, students are able to transfer their understanding to any writing situation they encounter. </p><br><p>This new edition has been refined and improved based on input from instructors using the text. Now with more explicit instruction to support academic writers, a new Part One explains the value of investigating writing, introduces threshold concepts and the notion of transfer, details the elements of genre and rhetorical reading, and offers a guide for conducting writing studies research at a level appropriate for undergraduates. The readings chapters have been updated and streamlined, and as in past editions they are supported with introductions, scaffolded questions, and activities.&nbsp; An extensive Instructor&#x2019;s Manual by teacher-trainer Matt Bryan provides support for teaching with a writing-about-writing approach.&nbsp; <br></p></p><p></p><h2>A Christmas Carol and Other Christmas Writings (Penguin Clothbound Classics)</h2><p>Part of Penguin&#39;s beautiful hardback Clothbound Classics series, designed by the award-winning Coralie Bickford-Smith, these delectable and collectible editions are bound in high-quality colourful, tactile cloth with foil stamped into the design. After reading Christmas Carol, the notoriously reculsive Thomas Carlyle was &#34;seized with a perfect convulsion of hospitality&#34; and threw not one but two Christmas dinner parties. The impact of the story may not always have been so dramatic but, along with Dickens other Christmas writings, it has had a lasting and significant influence upon our ideas about the Christmas spirit, and about the season as a time for celebration, charity, and memory.</p><p>In the history of English literature, Charles Dickens's <i>A Christmas Carol</i>, which has been continuously in print since it was first published in the winter of 1843, stands out as the quintessential Christmas story. What makes this charming edition of Dickens's immortal tale so special is the collection of 80 vivid illustrations by Everett Shinn (1876-1953). Shinn, a well-known artist in his time, was a popular illustrator of newspapers and magazines whose work displayed a remarkable affinity for the stories of Charles Dickens, evoking the bustling street life of the mid-1800s. Printed on heavy, cream-colored paper stock, the edges of the pages have been left rough, simulating the way in which the story might have appeared in Dickens's own time. Though countless editions of this classic have been published over the years, this one stands out as particularly beautiful, nostalgic, and evocative of the spirit of Christmas.<p>Traditional cover with this full-color gift edition in a slipcase.</p></p><h2>Never Bet Against Occam: Mast Cell Activation Disease and the Modern Epidemics of Chronic Illness and Medical Complexity</h2><p>In 2008 Dr. Afrin started coming to understand that a newly recognized type of mast cell disease, now called mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), was the underlying diagnosis in many patients he was seeing who were each suffering large assortments &#x2014; quite different from one patient to the next &#x2014; of chronic multisystem inflammatory illnesses of unclear cause.&nbsp; Dr. Afrin soon gained experience that MCAS is far more prevalent than the only mast cell disease previously known to medicine (the rare disease of mastocytosis) and that most MCAS patients, once accurately diagnosed, can eventually find significantly helpful medications targeted at the disease.&nbsp; The frequency and magnitude of the improvements Dr. Afrin has seen &#x2014; even the relief that comes from finally having a unifying diagnosis other than "psychosomatism" &#x2014; have spurred him to focus in this area, not only tending to the needs of his patients but also pursuing research to advance our understanding of the disease and helping to educate other professionals who in turn can help even more of the many people who have long been suffering not only the symptoms of the disease but also the natural concern of not understanding why one would be so "unlucky" to have acquired so many medical problems.&nbsp; As it turns out, such patients are not so unlucky and truly have just one root issue (and a very common one at that), which has the biological capability to develop, directly or indirectly, into most or all of their previously diagnosed problems.&nbsp; There is a great deal yet to learn about this, but even with just the present very limited understanding, the opportunity to diagnose and help patients with MCAS seems to be enormous and Dr. Afrin felt a description of the disease, written for the general public, might help lead some MCAS patients on a journey to diagnosis and improvement sooner rather than later.&nbsp; Dr. Afrin hopes this book will help people who might have, or do have, MCAS.&nbsp; A portion of the proceeds of purchases of this book will go to support research and education in this area.</p><p>Dr. Afrin earned a B.S. in computer science at Clemson University in 1984 and then an M.D. at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) in 1988, where he also pursued internal medicine residency and hematology/oncology clinical and research fellowships.&nbsp; While on faculty at MUSC from 1995-2014, he was active in undergraduate and graduate medical education, educational and information technology administration, and practice and research in hematology/oncology and medical informatics.&nbsp; Since the mid-&#x2019;00s, his clinical work has increasingly focused in hematology, especially mast cell disease.&nbsp; He joined the University of Minnesota in 2014 to further his interests in this area.&nbsp; He has an extensive record of peer-reviewed publications and has spoken widely in his areas of interest.A long overdue book competently written by one of the worldwide leading hematologists in the field of systemic mast cell diseases. In addition to the current state of knowledge about systemic mast cell activation disease, the author vividly illustrates a selection of possible clinical phenotypes of this disease by means of patient cases, emphasizing the many pitfalls in diagnosis and therapy. The book is an absolute must for all physicians (the frequency of systemic mast cell activation disease in the population amounts to about 10%) and affected patients. The author s brilliant style of writing makes reading a pleasure. --GERHARD J. MOLDERINGS, M.D., Associate Professor of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Molecular Geneticist, Mast Cell Immunologist, University Hospital of Bonn, Germany<br><br>Dr. Afrin's case studies illustrate how a single underlying disease process can explain a multitude of seemingly unrelated symptoms. This discovery has the potential to unlock some of the most perplexing medical mysteries of our time. His treatment protocols have ended years of patient suffering and offer much needed hope to the chronic illness community. --JENNIFER ROBIN KULIK, Founder, Mast Movement</p><h2>PEMF - The Fifth Element of Health: Learn Why Pulsed Electromagnetic Field (PEMF) Therapy Supercharges Your Health Like Nothing Else!</h2><p>You probably know that food, water, sunlight, and oxygen are required for life, but there is a fifth element of health that is equally vital and often overlooked: The Earth&#x2019;s magnetic field and its corresponding PEMFs (pulsed electromagnetic fields). The two main components of Earth&#x2019;s PEMFs, the Schumann and Geomagnetic frequencies, are so essential that NASA and the Russian space program equip their spacecrafts with devices that replicate these frequencies. These frequencies are absolutely necessary for the human body&#x2019;s circadian rhythms, energy production, and even keeping the body free from pain. But there is a big problem on planet earth right now, rather, a twofold problem, as to why we are no longer getting these life-nurturing energies of the earth. In this book we&#x2019;ll explore the current problem and how the new science of PEMF therapy (a branch of energy medicine), based on modern quantum field theory, is the solution to this problem, with the many benefits listed below:<br><br>� eliminate pain and inflammation naturally <br>� get deep, rejuvenating sleep<br>� increase your energy and vitality<br>� feel younger, stronger, and more flexible<br>� keep your bones strong and healthy<br>� help your body with healing and regeneration<br>� improve circulation and heart health<br>� plus many more benefits</p><p>Bryant Meyers, BS MA Physics, is a former physics professor, TV show host, and leading expert in the field of energy medicine and PEMF therapy. For over eighteen years, he has researched, tested, tried, and investigated well over $500,000 worth of energy medicine and frequency devices, studying with many of the world&#39;s experts. During the past six years he has dedicated his life and research to PEMF (Pulsed Electromagnetic Field) therapy, which he feels is the crown jewel of energy medicine. He has also helped and personally assisted thousands of people in this exciting new field.

As Dickens takes us through the case&#x2019;s history, he presents a cast of characters as idiosyncratic and memorable as any he ever created, including the beautiful Lady Dedlock, who hides a shocking secret about an illegitimate child and a long-lost love; Mr. Bucket, one of the first detectives to appear in English fiction; and the hilarious Mrs. Jellyby, whose endless philanthropy has left her utterly unconcerned about her own family. &amp;&amp;LBR&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LBR&amp;&amp;RAs a question of inheritance becomes a question of murder, the novel&#x2019;s heroine, Esther Summerson, struggles to discover the truth about her birth and her unknown mother&#x2019;s tragic life.

Dickens's tale takes us from the foggy dank streets of London and the maze of the Inns of Court to the peaceful countryside of England. Likewise, the characters run from murderous villains to virtuous girls, from a devoted lover to a "fallen woman," all of whom are affected by a legal suit in which there will, of course, be no winner. The first-person narrative related by the orphan Esther is particularly sweet. The articulate reading by the acclaimed British actor Paul Scofield, whose distinctive broad English accent lends just the right degree of sonority and humor to the text, brings out the color in this classic social commentary disguised as a Victorian drama. However, to abridge Dickens is, well, a Dickensian task, the results of which make for a story in which the author's convoluted plot lines and twists of fate play out in what seems to be a fast-forward format. Listeners must pay close attention in order to keep up with the multiple narratives and cast of curious characters, including the memorable Inspector Bucket and Mr. Guppy. Fortunately, the publisher provides a partial list of characters on the inside jacket. (<i>Running time: 3 hours; 2 cassettes</i>)Founded in 1906 by J.M.

I spoke another language, I no longer knew who I belonged to. The word &#x2018;mama&#x2019; stuck in my throat like a toad. And, nowadays, I really have no idea what kind of place mother is. It is not mine in the way one might have good health, a safe place, certainty.&#x201d;<br><br></p><p>Told with an immediacy and a rare expressive intensity that has earned it countless adoring readers and one of Italy&#x2019;s most prestigious literary prizes, <i>A Girl Returned</i> is a powerful novel rendered with sensitivity and verve by Ann Goldstein, translator of the works of Elena Ferrante. Set against the stark, beautiful landscape of Abruzzo in central Italy, this is a compelling story about mothers and daughters, about responsibility, siblings, and caregiving.<br><br></p><p>Without warning or explanation, an unnamed 13-year-old girl is sent away from the family she has always thought of as hers to live with her birth family: a large, chaotic assortment of individuals whom she has never met and who seem anything but welcoming. Thus begins a new life, one of struggle, tension, and conflict, especially between the young girl and her mother.

The setting is the L.A. funeral industry, where Whispering Glades provides deluxe service to deceased stars and their families, and the Happier Hunting Ground does the same for dead pets. (At Whispering Glades, staff must refer to the corpses only as "Loved Ones.") The industry provides a perfect foil for Waugh's deadpan wit--and an apt metaphor for the movie business.4 1-hour cassettes</p><h2>Organic Chemistry (William H. Brown and Lawrence S.

As Anne Perry writes in her Introduction, the novel &#34;has almost reached its first centenary, and it is as vivid and appealing as ever because the plotting is perfect. It is a classic example of how to construct, pace, and conclude a plot. . . .

Nobody can remember exactly how the case started but many different individuals have found their fortunes caught up in it. Esther Summerson watches as her friends and neighbours are consumed by their hopes and disappointments with the proceedings. But while the intricate puzzles of the lawsuit are being debated by lawyers, other more dramatic mysteries are unfolding that involve heartbreak, lost children, blackmail and murder.<br><br>The fog and cold that permeate Bleak House mirror a Victorian England mired in spiritual insolvency. Dickens brought all his passion, brilliance, and narrative verve to this huge novel of lives entangled in a multi-generational lawsuit&#x2014;and through it, he achieved, at age 41, a stature almost Shakespearean.<br><br>Introduction by Barbara Hardy</p><p><i>Bleak House</i> is a satirical look at the Byzantine legal system in London as it consumes the minds and talents of the greedy and nearly destroys the lives of innocents--a contemporary tale indeed. Dickens's tale takes us from the foggy dank streets of London and the maze of the Inns of Court to the peaceful countryside of England. Likewise, the characters run from murderous villains to virtuous girls, from a devoted lover to a "fallen woman," all of whom are affected by a legal suit in which there will, of course, be no winner. The first-person narrative related by the orphan Esther is particularly sweet. The articulate reading by the acclaimed British actor Paul Scofield, whose distinctive broad English accent lends just the right degree of sonority and humor to the text, brings out the color in this classic social commentary disguised as a Victorian drama. However, to abridge Dickens is, well, a Dickensian task, the results of which make for a story in which the author's convoluted plot lines and twists of fate play out in what seems to be a fast-forward format. Listeners must pay close attention in order to keep up with the multiple narratives and cast of curious characters, including the memorable Inspector Bucket and Mr. Guppy. Fortunately, the publisher provides a partial list of characters on the inside jacket.

What is an apprentice? It is a young person who is learning a skill from a master teacher. Our students will serve as apprentices to the great writers and great stories of history.<p> Students are often expected to write with no clear model before them.Modern composition scolds traditional writing instruction as rote and unimaginative.It takes imitation to task for a lack of freedom and personal expression.And yet, effective communication from writer to reader always requires some sort of form and structure.Many of historys greatest writers learned by imitation.In other words, writing takes the same kind of determined study as ballet or diving.Creativity uses conventional form as a stage or a springboard from which to launch grand jetes and somersaults. Too often students are expected to tackle complex writing assignments without learning the necessary intermediate steps.The assumption is that because most everyone can speak English well enough to be understood, and form letters with a pencil, that everyone should be able to write well. Yet how many of us would expect a child to sit at a piano, without piano lessons, and play a concerto?Writing is never automatic. </p><p> The Writing &amp; Rhetoric series method employs fluent reading, careful listening, models for imitation, and progressive steps.It assumes that students learn best by reading excellent, whole-story examples of literature and by growing their skills through imitation. Each exercise is intended to impart a skill (or tool) that can be employed in all kinds of writing and speaking.The exercises are arranged from simple to more complex. Whats more, the exercises are cumulative, meaning that later exercises incorporate the skills acquired in preceding exercises.This series is a step-by-step apprenticeship in the art of writing and rhetoric. </p><p>Narrative, the second book of twelve in the Writing &amp; Rhetoric series, uses parable, myth, and other tales to continue the recovery of the proven method of teaching writing, using various forms of narrative to teach beginning writers the craft of writing well.This is the second in a series of twelve books that will train students over six years, starting in grades three or four and up. </p><p> Writing &amp; Rhetoric Book 2:Narrative 1 Teachers Editionincludes the complete student text, as well as answer keys, teacher's notes, and explanations. For every writing assignment, this edition also supplies descriptions and examples of what excellent student writing should look like, providing the teacher with meaningful and concrete guidance. </p><p>Classical Academic Press </p><p> Educators will find all curricula by Classical Academic Press to be created with four important attributes.

Osborne, presents the main principles of game theory and shows how they can be used to understand economic, social, political, and biological phenomena. The book introduces in an accessible manner the main ideas behind the theory rather than their mathematical expression. All concepts are defined precisely, and logical reasoning is used throughout. The book requires an understanding of basic mathematics but assumes no specific knowledge of economics, political science, or other social or behavioral sciences. <br>Coverage includes the fundamental concepts of strategic games, extensive games with perfect information, and coalitional games; the more advanced subjects of Bayesian games and extensive games with imperfect information; and the topics of repeated games, bargaining theory, evolutionary equilibrium, rationalizability, and maxminimization. The book offers a wide variety of illustrations from the social and behavioral sciences and more than 280 exercises. Each topic features examples that highlight theoretical points and illustrations that demonstrate how the theory may be used. Explaining the key concepts of game theory as simply as possible while maintaining complete precision, <em>An Introduction to Game Theory</em> is ideal for undergraduate and introductory graduate courses in game theory.<br></p><p>Martin J. Osborne is at University of Toronto.<br>"This is a textbook to be enjoyed both by professors and students, full of clever and often original applications and examples. Serious students who use this text are likely to emerge with a new way of thinking about much of what they see in the real world."--Ted Bergstrom, <em>Professor of Economics,</em> <em>University of California, Santa Barbara</em><p></p><br>"The book is just superb. I anticipate (based both on my own reading of the book, and comments from colleagues at other institutions) that this will be the standard text for introductory courses in game theory in political science departments for the foreseeable future."--Scott Gehlbach, Assistant Professor of Political Science, <em>University of Wisconsin</em><p></p><br>"What distinguishes this book from other texts is its remarkable combination of rigor and accessibility. The central concepts of game theory are presented with the mathematical precision suitable for a graduate course, but with an abundance of wide-ranging examples that will give undergraduate students a concrete understanding of what the concepts mean and how they may be used."--Charles A. Wilson, <em>Professor of Economics, New York University</em><p></p><br>"A great book, by far the best out there in the market in thoroughness and structure."--Dorothea Herreiner, <em>Assistant Professor of Economics, Bowdoin College</em><p></p><br>"The ideal textbook for applied game theory . . . . It teaches basic game theory from the ground up, using just enough clearly defined technical terminology and ranging from traditional basics to the most modern tools."--Randy Calvert, <em>Professor of Political Science, Washington University in St.</em> <em>Louis</em><p></p><br>"The approach is intuitive, yet rigorous. Key concepts are explained through a series of examples to guide students through analysis. The examples are then followed by interesting and challenging questions. The main strength is the impressive set of exercises . . . they are extremely well organized and incredibly broad, ranging from easy questions to those for adventurous students."--In-Koo Cho, <em>William Kinkead Distinguished Professor of Economics, University of Illinois</em><p></p><br>"The gentle pace of the material along with the plethora of examples drawn from economics (mainly) and political science seems to work very well with students."-Branislav L. Slantchev,<em>Assistant Professor of Political Science, University of California, San Diego</em><p></p><br>"The book is excellent. It is chock full of exercises that are both interesting and applicable to real issues, allowing me great flexibility in focusing on specific examples to illustrate the theory."--Christopher Proulx, <em>Assistant Professor of Economics, University of California, Santa Barbara</em><p></p><br>"This book provides a simple yet precise introduction into game theory, suitable for the undergraduate level. Author Martin J. Osborne makes use of a wide variety of examples from social and behavioral sciences to convey game-theoretic reasoning. Readers can expect to gain a thorough understanding without any previous knowledge of economics, political science, or any other social or behavioral science.

In tracing the history of the Church from the time of Christ to the Great Persecution at the beginning of the fourth century and ending with the conversion of the Emperor Constantine, his aim was to show the purity and continuity of the doctrinal tradition of Christianity and its struggle against persecutors and heretics, and he supported his account by extensive quotations from original sources. This edition of G. A.

Paralleling Lucien&#x2019;s disastrously ambitious journey is the story of his friend and brother-in-law, hard-working inventor David S�chard, who is beset by unscrupulous competitors and cheated in his printing business by his own father.&amp;&amp;LBR&amp;&amp;R&nbsp;&amp;&amp;LBR&amp;&amp;RConsidered the founder of French realism, Balzac painted equally faithful pictures of the glittering but superficial world of society and the lonely struggle of impoverished men of genius. The city has a corrosive effect on Lucien&#x2019;s artistic talent and moral strength, while David takes a brave stand against the constraints of provincial small-mindedness. Balzac plays out their contrasting but intertwined stories against the enduring themes of love, ambition, greed, loyalty, vanity, and betrayal.

"He searched and dared everything."<br><br>Written between 1837 and 1843, <b>Lost Illusions</b> reveals, perhaps better than any other of Balzac's ninety-two novels, the nature and scope of his genius. The story of Lucien Chardon, a young poet from Angoul�me who tries desperately to make a name for himself in Paris, is a brilliantly realistic and boldly satirical portrait of provincial manners and aristocratic life. Handsome and ambitious but na�ve, Lucien is patronized by the beau monde as represented by Madame de Bargeton and her cousin, the formidable Marquise d'Espard, only to be duped by them. Denied the social rank he thought would be his, Lucien discards his poetic aspirations and turns to hack journalism; his descent into Parisian low life ultimately leads to his own death.<br><br>"Balzac was both a greedy child and an indefatigable observer of a greedy age, at once a fantastic and a genius, yet possessing a simple core of common sense," noted V. S. Pritchett, one of his several biographers. Another, Andr� Maurois, concluded: "Balzac was by turns a saint, a criminal, an honest judge, a corrupt judge, a minister, a fob, a harlot, a duchess, and always a genius." <br><br>This Modern Library edition presents the translation by Kathleen Raine.<br>The Modern Library of the World's<br>Best Books<br><br>"All Balzac's characters are endowed with the zest for life with which he himself was animated. All his fabrications are<br> as intensely colored as dreams. From the highest ranks of the aristocracy to the lowest dregs of society, all the actors in his<br> Comedie are more eager for life, more energetic and cunning in their struggles, more patient in misfortune, more greedy in pleasure, more angelic in devotion than they are in the comedy of the real world. In a word, everyone in Balzac has genius....Every living soul is a weapon loaded to the very muzzle with will."<br><p><br></p><p>--Charles Baudelaire</p></p><h2>Basic College Mathematics: An Applied Approach, Loose-leaf Version</h2><p>As in previous editions, the focus in BASIC COLLEGE MATHEMATICS remains on the Aufmann Interactive Method (AIM). Students are encouraged to be active participants in the classroom and in their own studies as they work through the How To examples and the paired Examples and You Try It problems. Student engagement is crucial to success. Presenting students with worked examples, and then providing them with the opportunity to immediately solve similar problems, helps them build their confidence and eventually master the concepts. Simplicity is key in the organization of this edition, as in all other editions. All lessons, exercise sets, tests, and supplements are organized around a carefully constructed hierarchy of objectives. Each exercise mirrors a preceding objective, which helps to reinforce key concepts and promote skill building. This clear, objective-based approach allows students to organize their thoughts around the content, and supports instructors as they work to design syllabi, lesson plans, and other administrative documents. New features like Focus on Success, Apply the Concept, and Concept Check add an increased emphasis on study skills and conceptual understanding to strengthen the foundation of student success. The Tenth Edition also features a new design, enhancing the Aufmann Interactive Method and making the pages easier for both students and instructors to follow.

The Eternal Husband and Other Stories is sterling Dostoevsky -- a collection of emotional power and an uncompromising insight into the human condition.</p>ece of this collection , "The Eternal Husband" (1890) is one of Dostoevsky's most perfect works. Classical in form, it presents his most profound exploration of mimetic rivalry and the duality of human consciousness. Told from the point of view of a rich and idle man who is confronted by a younger rival, the husband of his former, and now deceased, mistress, the story portrays the interchanging hatred and love of the two men.<br>Along with "The Eternal Husband" is "A Nasty Anecdote" (1862), a satire on the "reform period of Russia," which portrays a high-ranking official who is convinced that "humaneness" will unite all people in a regenerated society. The other three stories, "Bobok" (1873), "The Meek One" (1876) and "The Dream of A Ridiculous Man" (1877), are taken from <i>The Diary of a Writer,</i> which Dostoevsky published between the completion of <i>Demons</i> and <i>The Brothers Karamazov.</i></p><h2>A Survey of the Old Testament (Second Edition)</h2><p>A Survey of the Old Testament goes far beyond simply rephrasing biblical material to provide balanced insights on the literary, historical, and theological issues of each Old Testament book and of the Old Testament as a whole.

Lee, M.D., "but there is scant evidence for any of these claims and reams of evidence that synthetic estrogens are highly toxic and carcinogenic." Lee has studied the research and concludes that estrogen is not the magic bullet for protection against heart disease and osteoporosis, nor does it retard aging. Natural progesterone, instead, puts postmenopausal women's hormones in balance, says Lee. He cites study after study that indicates that natural progesterone, obtained in cream form, delivers what the usual HRT only promises. <p> "Menopause as a disease has been largely fabricated by physicians and the pharmaceutical industry," says this leader of a "quiet but powerful revolution" regarding HRT. <i>What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Menopause</i> covers the benefits of natural progesterone, the history and politics of the medical and drug establishment, the biochemistry and dynamics of hormones and how they get out of balance, and how to prevent hormone imbalance and stay healthy. Lee empowers you to ask hard questions of your doctor. Highly recommended. <i>--Joan Price</i></p></p><h2>Mexifornia: A State of Becoming</h2><p>This book is part history, part political analysis and part memoir. It is an intensely personal book about what has changed in California over the last quarter century.</p><p>Victor Davis Hanson, a classicist at California State University, Fresno, is author most recently of &#34;Carnage and Culture: Landmark Battles in the Rise of Western Power&#34; and &#34;An Autumn of War: What America Learned from September 11 and the War on Terror.&#34;*Starred Review* Classics professor Hanson is also, like generations of his family before him, a fruit farmer in California's central valley. He has employed immigrants, seen them flood his community during the last 30 years of mass flight from Mexico, and endured the crime associated with illegal immigrants. Hanson is immensely sympathetic to poor Mexicans, however, and the most powerful chapter here outlines the harried life of the illegal alien. But he hates to see the ordered culture in which he grew up drowned by an alien inundation whose undeserving beneficiaries are Mexico's kleptocratic rulers, for whom an open border is a safety valve expelling the potential for democratic change. The four solutions to the mess that Hanson enumerates include continuing de facto open borders but insisting on rapid acculturation; patrolling the border effectively and reducing legal immigration; imposing "sweeping restrictions on immigration" and ending Mexican chauvinism in the U.S.; and allowing present policies to make California increasingly mirror an unreformed Mexico. Hanson thinks that the U.S. "still need not do everything <i>right"</i> to prevent social collapse in the Southwest and that the totalitarian uniformity of valueless mass culture may soften that collapse. He also sees very clearly what has brought this crisis on: the American globalist ideology's lust for cheap labor and emphasis on "raw inclusiveness" instead of "standards and taste." <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Facing heavy competition from similar publications, Franklin took the unusual and controversial approach of injecting witty, unexpected entries between standard tables of tides, planetary motion, weather predictions and other facts. In the debut edition, faithfully reproduced here, he included under the heading Principal Kings of Europe, &#34;&#34;Poor Richard, an American Prince, without subjects, his wife being Viceroy over him, born October 23, 1684, age 49.&#34;&#34; The Almanack went on to become the most popular book of it&#39;s kind in colonial America and was published annually for the next 25 years. This facsimile offers a unique and entertaining look at 18th century American life and humor.Franklin's Autobiography is one of the most famous works in American literature. He started it as a private collection of anecdotes for his son, but soon it was transformed into a work of history, both personal and national, revealing Franklin as the man who, as Herman Melville said, possessed "deep worldly wisdom and polished Italian tact, gleaming under an air of Arcadian unaffectedness. <p>"From the Hardcover edition.</p></p><h2>Swatch Reference Guide for Fashion Fabrics: Bundle Book + Studio Access Card</h2><p><p>Featuring the most current and high-quality fashion fabrics, <i>Swatch Reference Guide for Fashion Fabrics</i>, Fourth Edition, is an all-in-one text and swatch book focused on the needs of fashion students.

You must pardon me if I repeat that remark now and then in these letters; I want you to take seriously the things I am telling you, and I feel that if I were in your place and you in mine, I should need that reminder from time to time, to keep my credulity from flagging.</p><p>In <em>Letters from the Earth, </em>Twain presents himself as the Father of History -- reviewing and interpreting events from the Garden of Eden through the Fall and the Flood, translating the papers of Adam and his descendants through the generations.

Our economy is sluggish, and leaves workers insecure. Income inequality, cultural divisions, and political polarization increasingly pull us apart. Our governing institutions often seem paralyzed. And our politics has failed to rise to these challenges.<br><br> No wonder, then, that Americans--and the politicians who represent them--are overwhelmingly nostalgic for a better time. The Left looks back to the middle of the twentieth century, when unions were strong, large public programs promised to solve pressing social problems, and the movements for racial integration and sexual equality were advancing. The Right looks back to the Reagan Era, when deregulation and lower taxes spurred the economy, cultural traditionalism seemed resurgent, and America was confident and optimistic. Each side thinks returning to its golden age could solve America's problems.<br><br> In <i>The Fractured Republic</i>, Yuval Levin argues that this politics of nostalgia is failing twenty-first-century Americans. Both parties are blind to how America has changed over the past half century--as the large, consolidated institutions that once dominated our economy, politics, and culture have fragmented and become smaller, more diverse, and personalized. Individualism, dynamism, and liberalization have come at the cost of dwindling solidarity, cohesion, and social order. This has left us with more choices in every realm of life but less security, stability, and national unity.<br><br>Both our strengths and our weaknesses are therefore consequences of these changes. And the dysfunctions of our fragmented national life will need to be answered by the strengths of our decentralized, diverse, dynamic nation.<br>Levin argues that this calls for a modernizing politics that avoids both radical individualism and a centralizing statism and instead revives the middle layers of society&#x2014;families and communities, schools and churches, charities and associations, local governments and markets. Through them, we can achieve not a single solution to the problems of our age, but multiple and tailored answers fitted to the daunting range of challenges we face and suited to enable an American revival.<br></p><p>Yuval Levin is the Hertog Fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center and the founder and editor of <i>National Affairs</i>.

He lives in Maryland.<i><b>Wall Street Journal:</b></i><br>"Compelling.... Yuval Levin has written an incisive and irenic critique of contemporary American society, together with a series of reflections that offer a way forward without trafficking in the false hope of 'solutions.' That he has done so in fewer than 250 pages of clear, well-organized prose ought to make the book famous for a generation. Maybe, in time, we can stop asking why the former days were better than these."<br><br><b>J.D. Vance, <i>Wall Street Journal:</i></b><br>"Mr. Levin is among the Republican Party's great intellectual leaders and has proposed a new direction for conservatism. We'll soon learn whether the party's political leaders follow his wise advice."<br><b>Senator Mike Lee, <i>Wall Street Journal:</i></b><br>"Amid the confusion and clamor, Yuval Levin's <i>The Fractured Republic</i> stands out as a penetrating diagnosis of the emerging fault lines in American society."<br><i><b>Commentary:</b></i><br>Superb.... <i>The Fractured Republic</i> is not a manual or blueprint for reform, and it does not offer a checklist of repairs to make America whole again. Instead, it merges a deep philosophic understanding of the American experiment and a conceptual analysis of American history into a practical basis from which we can examine contemporary American problems with crystalline clarity. Levin calls his book an 'essay,' and it provides the bracing shock of illumination that is the hallmark of all great essays."<br><br><i><b>Weekly Standard:</b></i><br>"[This book] couldn't have come out at a better time. <i>The Fractured Republic</i> is half diagnosis and half prescription. And both halves are essential reading, especially as we contemplate what the current election means for our body politic."<br><br><i><b>Commentary:</b></i><br>"In a bleak political year, there comes a shaft of light in the form of an extraordinary new book, <i>The Fractured Republic</i>.... [Levin] is among America's most important and humane conservative thinkers. Yuval Levin's brilliant new book offers social conservatives a more effective approach to social engagement not only because it's more positive but because it's more true, because it appeals to people on a deeper level, because offering people a healing grace and hope is what is likely to be especially attractive and powerful in this time of disorientation, distemper, and confusion."<br><br><i><b>Christian Century:</b></i><br>A gracefully written, big-picture analysis of American society and politics."<br><br><b>Jonah Goldberg</b><b>,</b><i><b> Los Angeles Times:</b></i><br>"Brilliant."<br><br><b>David Brooks, <i>New York Times</i></b><br>"There are just a few essential reads if you want to understand the American social and political landscape today.... Today, I'd add Yuval Levin's fantastic new book, <i>The Fractured Republic</i>...I learned something new on every page."<br><br><b>Michael Gerson, <i>Washington Post:</i></b><br>Instead of desperately trying to go back in time to recover lost unity, Levin urges citizens to look forward as well as downward, to improve the cultural patch around them. This future orientation may seem like an odd message for a conservative, and it is all the more powerful for coming from one. The goal is not to make America great... again. It is to make America great in a distinctly 21st-century way."</p><h2>The Seven Mysteries of Life: An Exploration in Science and Philosophy</h2><p>Mixing science with philosophy, the author contemplates what he perceives to be the seven mysteries of life, ranging from evolution to divinity</p><p>Guy Murchie, the author of Song of the Sky, Music of the Spheres, and The Soul School, won the John Burroughs Medal.</p><h2>Brideshead Revisited (Everyman&#39;s Library)</h2><p><p>(Book Jacket Status: Jacketed)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Evelyn Waugh&#x2019;s most celebrated novel is a memory drama about the intense entanglement of the narrator, Charles Ryder, with a great Anglo-Catholic family. Written during World War II, the novel mourns the passing of the aristocratic world Waugh knew in his youth and vividly recalls the sensuous pleasures denied him by wartime austerities; in so doing it also provides a profound study of the conflict between the demands of religion and the desires of the flesh. At once romantic, sensuous, comic, and somber, <i>Brideshead Revisited</i> transcends Waugh&#x2019;s familiar satiric exploration of his cast of lords and ladies, Catholics and eccentrics, artists and misfits, revealing him to be an elegiac, lyrical novelist of the utmost feeling and lucidity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The edition reprinted here contains Waugh&#x2019;s revisions, made in 1959, and his preface to the revised edition.</p></p><p>A departure from Evelyn Waugh's normally comic theater, <b>Brideshead Revisited</b> concerns the tale of Charles Ryder, a captain in the British Army in post-World War I England. Unlike Waugh's previous narrators, Ryder is an intelligent man, looking back on much of his life from his current post in Oxford. He strikes a special friendship with Lord Sebastian Flyte as the setting moves to the Brideshead estate and a baroque castle that recalls England's prior standing in the world. Ryder falls for Flyte's sister while families, politics and religions collide. What makes the book extraordinary is Waugh's sharp, vivid style and his use of dialect and minor characters. This is one of Waugh's finest accomplishments and a superb book.8 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Electrical Engineering: Principles and Applications</h2><p>For undergraduate introductory or survey courses in electrical engineering.

Pumla Gobodo-Madikizela, a psychologist who grew up in a black South African township, reflects on her interviews with Eugene de Kock, the commanding officer of state-sanctioned death squads under apartheid. Gobodo-Madikizela met with de Kock in Pretoria&#39;s maximum-security prison, where he is serving a 212-year sentence for crimes against humanity. In profoundly arresting scenes, Gobodo-Madikizela conveys her struggle with contradictory internal impulses to hold him accountable and to forgive. Ultimately, as she allows us to witness de Kock&#39;s extraordinary awakening of conscience, she illuminates the ways in which the encounter compelled her to redefine the value of remorse and the limits of forgiveness.</p><p>PUMLA GOBODO-MADIKIZELA served on the Human Rights Violations Committee of South Africa&#x2019;s great national experiment in healing, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.

Before I could make myself ready, a huge sign high above me at the entrance announced the noble agenda: Correctional Services: Pretoria.&#x201d; The reassuringly professional sign was one of many changes, I half noted, that must have been introduced by the new black director of prisons. I slowed down my car, drove up to within a few yards of the prison entrance, and turned the engine off. I sat there, seeing but not seeing the people milling around gloomily after a visit with loved ones, waiting for the taxi vans that would drive them back to the impoverished townships on the outskirts of Pretoria. My anxiety built until I felt as if it could have exploded through the windows of my car.<br> The white guard stationed by the prison entrance was by now looking at me suspiciously. I impulsively turned on the ignition, not sure whether to move the car or, as I then decided, to get out, approach the security checkpoint, and announce myself to the guard. Anticipating that he would ask me to spell my name, I handed him my business card. He went to the telephone in his small observation room and returned to tell me that Doreen Krause, the head of the maximum security section of the prison, was expecting me. This hardly came as a relief; by now I needed something any obstacle that would give me an excuse to abandon my mission. Farther down the road I could see the massive gray concrete walls of the medium and maximum security sections of the prison.<br> The last time I&#x2019;d come here was in 1989 to interview a man on death row for killing a white farmer in the Eastern Cape. There was to be a retrial, and the prisoner&#x2019;s lawyers had asked me to prepare a psychological report on him. That time I had driven straight to the prison without going through Pretoria. Pretoria was a city filled with too many of apartheid&#x2019;s symbols the Union building, the seat of apartheid&#x2019;s parliament, the statues of Afrikaner heroes, prison cells, and buildings of torture where many opponents of apartheid, black and white, had died or disappeared or mysteriously committed suicide. Pretoria was the heart and soul of apartheid, and I had no desire to set foot there. But now, as I returned to the prison eight years later, Pretoria symbolized something new. It was the city where Nelson Mandela had been inaugurated as the first president of a democratic South Africa. A workforce that reflected this new South Africa had replaced many of the white men and women who had been the civil servants of one of the most brutally repressive systems in modern history. This day, on my way to the Central Prison, I&#x2019;d driven into Pretoria to experience the atmosphere that came along with this new phase in my country&#x2019;s existence.<br> I had intended to stop only long enough to pick up some extra batteries for my small tape recorder and to buy coffee before heading for the prison in time for my appointment at noon. Instead, within a few minutes of entering the city, I lost my sense of direction and was driving around in circles through Pretoria&#x2019;s busy streets. It was a surreal scene in which the forbidding architecture of the apartheid era assumed a menacing air and the one-way streets seemed to entangle me in a maze from which I couldn&#x2019;t free myself. Even the jacaranda blooms trademark of Pretoria&#x2019;s beauty lining some of the streets into which I strayed couldn&#x2019;t calm me. I stopped three times in the sweltering heat to ask for directions to the prison, on each occasion getting either inadequate or misleading directions. At last help came. At a set of traffic lights on Schubert Street I rolled down my window to take a chance on a middle-aged white Afrikaner motorist in a van. He offered to lead me to the road that would take me to the prison, and I followed him and his ordinary human goodness on my way.<br><br>Did I have any weapons in the car? the guard asked. I opened the glove compartment and then the trunk of my car for the security check. Within a few minutes I was driving down the road that led to the maximum security section of the prison, where some of South Africa&#x2019;s most hardened murderers were warehoused. I parked my car and walked toward the massive black metal gates. Inside stood a uniformed black guard who spoke to me through a square opening screened by iron bars. He opened this gate, and as it swung out I took a few steps back. Within seconds I had been escorted inside, and I found myself standing in the middle of a small, dark, stuffy passage with no windows a checkpoint before visitors were allowed into the main building of the section. Awed, my heart beating hard, I stared at the blank concrete walls and wondered, as I had during my visit eight years before, where the prison&#x2019;s execution chamber was. South Africa had by now scrapped the death penalty. But I couldn&#x2019;t help wondering which corner of the prison apartheid&#x2019;s hangman had presided over. I could see in an adjacent room a guard in uniform, a semiautomatic assault rifle braced smartly against his hefty shoulder. He stepped out and asked me pleasantly what the purpose of my visit was. Oh, you are the one to see Dikoko.&#x201d; I was indeed very close to seeing Dikoko,&#x201d; Eugene de Kock, the man whom many in the country considered the most brutal of apartheid&#x2019;s covert police operatives. Prime Evil&#x201d; his far less familial-sounding nickname would be more than an abstraction to me within minutes. I was thankful for the presence of the black guard, and amused by his and all the other black guards&#x2019; mispronunciation of de Kock&#x201d; as Dikoko.&#x201d; As behind-the-scenes engineer of apartheid&#x2019;s murderous operations, he had been faceless and nameless. Now that he was exposed, his name was as unpronounceable as unspeakable as his deeds.<br> Another guard was called, and I was escorted out of the reception room and into a paved area with a small patch of green grass a rich green that seemed to have been thrown into the midst of the prison gray to shock. My escort and I approached the main maximum security building, the immaculately polished brass trim of its entrance sparkling in the sun. The journey through the prison gates, a total of nine, was not undramatic. Walking through the maze of passages with brightly polished floors thanks to cheap prison labor I heard excited shouts and whistling from some black prisoners on a balcony above. They seemed to be enjoying the sight of a female visitor navigating the prison&#x2019;s corridors. Trying not to spoil their fun, I looked up and acknowledged their cheers with a smile. At that moment I felt as if I needed to be cheered more than they did. Finally, leaving behind me the shouting prisoners and noisy keys, each sounding its own note of power at each prison gate, I passed through a metal detector and the last entrance to C-Max,&#x201d; the section where de Kock was imprisoned. My jitteriness caused me to seize on a second irony. The covert operations unit from which de Kock had commanded fear and power and crafted apartheid&#x2019;s most brutal schemes was the C&#x201d; section of the security department. Now he had come to lose that power in the C&#x201d; section of the prison, where, as a prisoner categorized as among the most dangerous, he had no privileges, no power.<br> In C-Max I was walking into a world of even more intense grays gray walls, gray ceiling, gray floor. In search of some escape from this dull, depressing grayness, my mind wandered to the patch of green I had seen outside. It was an image I would return to many times in my subsequent trips to the prison; the grass stood out in my mind as an invitation to escape from the world of the living dead to that of the living.<br> The first thing I noticed when I stepped into the room was de Kock&#x2019;s bright orange prison overalls. The color was shocking, so much a part of the scenery I associated with the many prison movies I had seen. Silence of the Lambs immediately came to mind, and there was something about that memory that brought a shiver, though its real significance in my meeting with de Kock would emerge two weeks later. As I entered the tiny room, with gray walls and a disproportionately long table and an old leather chair with wheels, de Kock got up, balancing himself against the wall. His feet were chained to a metal stool bolted to the floor. He smiled politely, making eye contact from behind his black-rimmed thick lenses. I could hear the clattering of his leg chains as he awkwardly steadied himself, extending his hand to greet me. He spoke in a heavy Afrikaans accent: It&#x2019;s a pleasure to meet you.&#x201d; I knew the face; I had seen it in the newspapers, and at public hearings during his first appearance before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, but this was the closest I had ever been to Eugene de Kock. As he smiled shyly, perhaps politely, rising to greet me, I saw a flicker of boyishness, of uncertainty. At the same time, my mind registered Prime Evil,&#x201d; the name that marked him as the surest evidence of all that had happened under apartheid. De Kock had not just given apartheid&#x2019;s murderous evil a name. He had become that evil. The embodiment of evil stood there politely smiling at me.<br> I, like every black South African, have lived a life shaped by the violence and the memories of apartheid. I have three linked stories to share.<br> In 1994 I was completing my doctoral fellowship at Harvard University. On the morning of April 27 I joined the many South Africans assembled at the State House in Boston, where a voting center for South Africans had been created. I was the first person to vote, and my emotions were so intense that I seemed to feel them concretely as something that flooded through me. As I walked to the voting booths, I had an overwhelming sense that I was being transported from one historical moment, where I&#x2019;d been a second-class citizen in my country of birth where my parents and their parents had been sent from this place to that, wherever the mass removals and demolitions of black areas destined them to go, finally settling in the nominally independent homeland&#x201d; of Transkei to another historical moment of power, pride, and affirmation. I remember later that day feeling a deep satisfaction, as if I had just completed a difficult race.<br> When I returned to South Africa in June of that year, on a beautiful clear winter day, I became aware for the first time that in my past travels I could not have described myself as a South African. I could only say that I was from South Africa. I remember thinking as my plane landed that day in Cape Town, This is my country, my home. Driving from the airport, past Langa Township, where I grew up, with its informal settlement&#x201d; sprawl visible from the freeway, I couldn&#x2019;t help recalling that when I was a child living in the township, Cape Town had been out of my reach. As township dwellers, we were Cape Towners in name only. I never truly saw Table Mountain, the epitome of the beauty of this magnificent city, although it is within visual reach of the township; it was part of the world that had tried to strip my people of their dignity and respect, part of the world that had reduced them to second-class citizens in their own country. Langa, like all other South African townships, which were established by the apartheid government as a labor pool for white business, was a world of poverty, where all houses looked alike, each connected to the next like carriages in a long, endless train; where people left their homes to catch early morning trains that took them to the city at dawn; where a history of discrimination, repression, and exclusion from the privileges that citizenship and wealth confer had left its debilitating mark of poverty.<br> The first time I witnessed a scene of violence, I was five.<br> On March 21, 1960, a remarkable event occurred that transformed the nature of the anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa. That day several thousand black people gathered in the township of Sharpeville to protest the notorious pass laws requiring blacks to carry internal passports, thus totally regulating their lives. The police opened fire on the crowd, killing 69 and wounding 186, including women and children. Most of the victims were shot in the back while fleeing. The Sharpeville incident was followed by countrywide demonstrations in black townships, leading to more bloodshed. In the township of Langa, the carnage was worse than in Sharpeville. At least this is how I would remember the events that I witnessed as a little girl of five from behind the hedge of my mother&#x2019;s small garden of our tiny house at 69 Brinton Street.<br> My memory of the 1960 Langa violence is something I still find difficult to shake out of my mind. Yet its accuracy was tested in 1996 when, as a committee member on South Africa&#x2019;s Truth and Reconciliation Commission, I was forced to revisit the events in Langa Township. What I remembered was the commotion in the row of houses on my street all replicas of the matchbox structure that was my home. Men I knew as fathers of the girls and boys I played with were running past looking frightened, jumping fences to be anywhere but in their own homes. These were men I referred to as father,&#x201d; or so-and-so&#x2019;s father.&#x201d; We never called them by their first names. These were the same fathers you would not want to catch you doing anything wrong in the streets, like playing outside in the dark. Countless times I had shared candy with their children, candy already in my mouth, or in theirs, split and broken into bits inside the mouth so that one, two, or three others could have whatever tiny piece could be shared. These were the men who brought us the candy, but now they were scared and running.<br> Men I had never seen in my home came out of the coal shed at the back of our house with blackened faces. Some came into the house, moving beds to hide under them, or in closets. Others wore what I later remembered as a look of defiance or impotent rage. My own father was nowhere in sight, and my mother, heavily pregnant with my youngest sister, Sesi, was frantically calling out to the neighbors to try to establish his whereabouts. To escape this chaos of men scared and defiant men running in and out of my home, I went outside. There I saw what they were all running away from. Army trucks that looked like huge monsters roamed the streets menacingly, some charging furiously over walkways and into the large field in front of our house to fire into scattered groups of people. Vaguely aware of my elder brother standing behind me, I was witnessing something I had until then never seen before: live shooting, blood, and human death. The image that I was to recall many years later was that of a street covered in blood and bodies lined up like cattle in a slaughterhouse.<br> The indelible mark left by this incident returned in a flash on June 16, 1976, when I learned that police had on that day massacred over five hundred black students involved in a peaceful march against the imposition of Afrikaans as a language of instruction. When the youthful uprising broke out into violent protest in the Cape Town townships in August of that year, the memory of those bodies, bloodied and dismembered, on Brinton Street sixteen years earlier cried out inside me. At Fort Hare University (which was later closed for the rest of the year), I packed my bags and with other students abandoned my studies to be part of the protests.<br> Twenty years later, when I was invited to join the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), I was shocked to learn that what in my memory was a massacre&#x201d; had been otherwise. According to archival records, one death had resulted from the police shootings in Langa.<br> What conclusions can be drawn from what is to me a still haunting discre...</p><h2>The Idea of the World: A Multi-Disciplinary Argument for the Mental Nature of Reality</h2><p><p>A rigorous case for the primacy of mind in nature, from philosophy to neuroscience, psychology and physics. The Idea of the World offers a grounded alternative to the frenzy of unrestrained abstractions and unexamined assumptions in philosophy and science today. This book examines what can be learned about the nature of reality based on conceptual parsimony, straightforward logic and empirical evidence from fields as diverse as physics and neuroscience. It compiles an overarching case for idealism - the notion that reality is essentially mental - from ten original articles the author has previously published in leading academic journals. The case begins with an exposition of the logical fallacies and internal contradictions of the reigning physicalist ontology and its popular alternatives, such as bottom-up panpsychism. It then advances a compelling formulation of idealism that elegantly makes sense of - and reconciles - classical and quantum worlds. The main objections to idealism are systematically refuted and empirical evidence is reviewed that corroborates the formulation presented here. The book closes with an analysis of the hidden psychological motivations behind mainstream physicalism and the implications of idealism for the way we relate to the world.</p></p><p>Bernardo Kastrup has a Ph.D. in philosophy and another in computer engineering. He has been a scientist in some of the world&#39;s foremost scientific laboratories. His main interests are metaphysics and philosophy of mind.Tremendous tension is building in the world of neuroscience over the relationship between mind and brain -- just what is the true nature of consciousness? A building consilience from the fields of psychology, physics and neuroscience supports the primacy of consciousness in the universe, or a top-down organizing principle at the heart of all reality. One of the strongest new elements of this bridge comes from the physics perspective of Bernardo Kastrup in support of the reality of ontological or metaphysical idealism. His revolutionary and insightful book, <i>The Idea of the World, </i>connects the dots brilliantly through a series of masterfully-woven articles, making an elegant case for the advantages of idealism over physicalism, especially in the face of contextuality in quantum physics, the 'hard problem' of consciousness, and the subject combination problem in philosophy of mind. The result is a must-read book for anyone seriously interested in the modern neuroscience of consciousness, and its broad implications for humanity. Bravo, Bernardo!<b>Eben Alexander, MD, Neurosurgeon, author of <i>Proof of Heaven, The Map of Heaven</i> and <i>Living in a Mindful Univers</i>e.</b><br><br>A viable pathway to a better world does appear in principle to be opening up. Bernardo Kastrup has contributed at many levels to the development of this emerging vision, and this fine new book gives me real hope that the main barrier to its widespread acceptance is on the verge of collapse. A major inflection point in modern intellectual history is close at hand!<b>Edward F. Kelly, PhD, Professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Neurobehavioral Sciences at the University of Virginia, lead author of <i>Irreducible Mind</i> (2007) and <i>Beyond Physicalism</i> (2015).</b><br><br>It is hard to find a book that would not just repeat works already published but instead build on them and present a coherent whole. <i>The Idea of the World</i> does this marvelously.<b>Menas C. Kafatos, PhD, Fletcher Jones Endowed Chair Professor of Computational Physics at Chapman University, Orange, California, USA.</b><br><br>Bernardo Kastrup is one of the leading thinkers today about the nature of consciousness. In his latest book <i>The Idea of the World,</i> he presents a compelling argument that consciousness is fundamental and causal, that reality arises from consciousness, not consciousness from spacetime. He writes well, and his arguments are well-grounded. This book is worthy of your attention.<b>Stephan A. Schwartz, scientist, futurist, historian, and writer.</b><br><br>In my view, the philosopher-scientist Bernardo Kastrup is one of the most important thinkers of the moment on the crucial subject of the nature of consciousness -- crucial because the way we understand consciousness and reality shapes our outlook on the world, and on life and existence generally. In his latest and most commanding book to date, <i>The Idea of the World: A multi-disciplinary argument for the mental nature of reality,</i> Kastrup consolidates and powers up his argument that, unlike that of physicalism or panpsychism, consciousness is causal and fundamental, that our reality arises from consciousness, is consciousness in effect, and not the other way round; that physical structures are circumscribed by consciousness, and not the other way round. As Kastrup says, most theories of reality that contradict mainstream physicalism are dismissed as not rigorous or plausible enough. Of these, nearly all theories that claim consciousness to be the fundamental substrate of existence 'are pooh-poohed as flaky New Age nonsense'. So, with analytical and critical flair and rigour, on his mission to save us from the morass of ontological misinformation, he has produced an inspiring masterwork to counter such prejudices. The issues and questions Kastrup raises are all of major significance for the world today and deserve wide, serious and continuous discussion.<b>Geoff Ward, writer, poet, tutor and mentor in literature and creative writing (MA and BA Hons degrees in English literature), editor, journalist and musician.</b></p><h2>The American Journey, Student Edition (THE AMERICAN JOURNEY (SURVEY))</h2><p>New Page 1 <p>THE AMERICAN JOURNEY<br> THE COMPLETE STORY OF AMERICAN HISTORY IN ONE COMPREHENSIVE MIDDLE SCHOOL PROGRAM</p> <p>The American Journey is a superb, readable presentation of American history, from pre-exploration to the present.

Many readers were so inspired by Solnit's book that they bought multiple copies to give to friends. This new, significantly expanded edition covers, among other things, the political territory of America and the world after George Bush's re-election. Acclaimed author Rebecca Solnit draws on her life as a writer and activist, on the events of our moment, on our deepest past, to argue for hope&#x2014;hope even in the dark. Solnit reminds us of how changed the world has been by the activism of the past five decades. Offering a dazzling account of some of the least expected of those changes, she proposes a vision of cause-and-effect relations that provides new grounds for political engagement in the present. Counting historic victories&#x2014;from the fall of the Berlin wall to the Zapatista uprising to Seattle in 1999 to the worldwide marches against war in Iraq to Cancun in September 2003&#x2014;she traces the rise of a sophisticated, supple, nonviolent new movement that unites all the diverse and fragmentary issues of the eighties and nineties in our new century.</p><p>Rebecca Solnit&#39;s previous books include River of Shadows, Hollow City, As Eve Said to the Serpent, Savage Dreams and Wanderlust: A History of Walking. An activist and cultural historian, she writes about place, environment, politics and culture. Rebecca Solnit is the recipient of the Lannan literary award and lives in San Francisco. SHe is the winner of the 2003 National Book Critics Circle Award.This slim volume, to quote the author's own reflections on the quincentennial of Columbus's discovery of America, is "a zigzag trail of encounters, reactions, and realizations." Solnit, recent winner of an NBCC award for criticism for <i>River of Shadows: Eadweard Muybridge and the Technological Wild West,</i> rambles from place to place and topic to topic in a discursive examination of the current state of leftist protest and activism. Unwilling to accept the bleak, almost apocalyptic worldview of many of her progressive counterparts, Solnit celebrates the hope and optimism that recent episodes reveal. She points to the resurrection of indigenous causes represented by Zapatismo, the WTO protests in Seattle and Cancun and the worldwide protests against the U.S.-led war in Iraq, and other smaller, more marginal protests. Solnit argues persuasively that engaged, thoughtful dissent is far healthier today than many believe. Activists, who operate by nature on the fringes of hierarchies of economy and power, often fail to recognize the power of activity that seems inconsequential. Her goal, in essence, is "to throw out the crippling assumptions with which many activists proceed." While Solnit's goal is admirable and her prose graceful, this book suffers from the same confusion and disorganization she recognizes as necessarily inherent to activism itself. Her examples are diverse yet disjointed; she is overly reliant on the words of others; and she often wanders into spiritual mumbo-jumbo and platitudes. While these tendencies hamper the clarity of her argument, fans of Solnit and progressives may find much to admire here. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Charles Dickens&#x2019;s famous ghost story is as much a part of the season as plum pudding and mistletoe, and Michael Patrick Hearn, the celebrated annotator of <em>The Wizard of Oz</em> and <em>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</em>, has prepared this sumptuous, thoroughly annotated edition, which has already become the definitive edition of our century. Initially published by Norton in 2004, this is the first edition to combine the original story with Dickens&#x2019;s Public Reading text, published to coincide with his 1867-68 American tour, which has not been reprinted in nearly a century. Included are rare photographs as well as the original Leech wood engravings and hand-colored etchings, supplemented by other contemporary illustrations by George Cruikshank, Gustave Dor�, John Tenniel, and &#x201c;Phiz.&#x201d; <em>The Annotated Christmas Carol</em> will be a literary feast for the whole family for generations. 2-color throughout, 100 black-and-white illustrations, and 8 pages of full color</p><p>In the history of English literature, Charles Dickens's <i>A Christmas Carol</i>, which has been continuously in print since it was first published in the winter of 1843, stands out as the quintessential Christmas story. What makes this charming edition of Dickens's immortal tale so special is the collection of 80 vivid illustrations by Everett Shinn (1876-1953). Shinn, a well-known artist in his time, was a popular illustrator of newspapers and magazines whose work displayed a remarkable affinity for the stories of Charles Dickens, evoking the bustling street life of the mid-1800s. Printed on heavy, cream-colored paper stock, the edges of the pages have been left rough, simulating the way in which the story might have appeared in Dickens's own time. Though countless editions of this classic have been published over the years, this one stands out as particularly beautiful, nostalgic, and evocative of the spirit of Christmas.<p>Traditional cover with this full-color gift edition in a slipcase.</p></p><h2>Grimm&#39;s Complete Fairy Tales (Leatherbound Classic Collection) by Brothers Grimm (2012) Leather Bound</h2><p>Used.

They made it possible for small-town carpenters, who were already skilled in rudimentary carpentry and house construction, to give their buildings sophistication and style. There were instructions for raising and supporting several types of roofs, constructing winding stairs, spacing fluting evenly on columns, modeling and mounting friezes, etc. Carpenters were thus able to plan, build, and decorate complex, ornate structures.<br><i>The American Builder's Companion</i> includes rules and definitions of practical geometry and discussion of methods for drawing basic shapes and cutting them out of solids. There are designs for interior ornament &#x2014; patterns for decorative cornices, moldings, banisters, stucco ceiling ornaments, mantels, etc., as well as designs for doorways and windows. Benjamin also deals with problematic structural elements, and finally provides full plans and elevations for private houses, wooden churches, and a court house.<br>Important as one of the single, major disseminators of a style which became almost ubiquitous in the Northeast, Benjamin's book also contains a rich store of evidence on problems and achievements of early American builders. Direct references to tools, materials, common practices and processes, and unconscious indication of taste and aesthetic values of the time will be invaluable to students of architecture, experts in restoration, and readers interested in American history and culture.

There the 111-year-old, a shade of history who strutted unnoticed through the mythic West, recounted his acquaintances with notables such as George Custer and Wild Bill Hickok, as well as his shuttling between the worlds of whites and Indians. In <i>The Return of Little Big Man</i>, ostensibly a long-lost addendum to these memoirs, we get more of the tale--or more hot air, perhaps. "Just listen to what I tell you, and then check it against the facts if you can," our hero invites.<p> <i>Return</i> has much in common with its predecessor. Once again, Crabb seems to have known everyone and been nearly everywhere, and his many associates--both notorious and anonymous--reappear as if by miracle. Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday, and Annie Oakley all check in; while Crabb himself wanders the globe as Buffalo Bill Cody's right-hand man, witnesses both Hickok's and Sitting Bull's murders, and crouches behind a wagon during the O.K. Corral shootout. Berger's Twain-esque ruminations lend an air of purposefulness to Crabb's meanderings, a sense that separation is merely provisional, that existence only appears haphazard.</p><p> Crabb, however, seems more than occasionally dispirited--friends pass, younger men ascend. Midway through, though, the book gets its real charge, as Crabb confronts a fading world and a future both bright and bewildering. Sustained by an enormous heart, an affinity for exaggeration, and a conscience both weary and sentimental, he acknowledges the best--and worst--in everyone he meets. It's a story you'd like to believe. <i>--Ben Guterson</i></p>Thomas Berger, whom the London Times Literary Supplement has called &#34;one of the century&#39;s most important writers,&#34; is the author of more than twenty novels, a number of which have been made into movies, including LITTLE BIG MAN.

It was a permission Colby was to regret. The CIA would rescind it, making every effort to impede publication of The Phoenix Program, which documented the CIA&#x2019;s elaborate system of population surveillance, control, entrapment, imprisonment, torture and assassination in Vietnam.While researching Phoenix, Valentine learned that the CIA allowed opium and heroin to flow from its secret bases in Laos, to generals and politicians on its payroll in South Vietnam. His investigations into this illegal activity focused on the CIA&#x2019;s relationship with the federal drugs agencies mandated by Congress to stop illegal drugs from entering the United States. Based on interviews with senior officials, Valentine wrote two subsequent books, The Strength of the Wolf and The Strength of the Pack, showing how the CIA infiltrated federal drug law enforcement agencies and commandeered their executive management, intelligence and foreign operations staffs in order to ensure that the flow of drugs continues unimpeded to traffickers and foreign officials in its employ.Ultimately, portions of his research materials would be archived at the National Security Archive, Texas Tech University&#x2019;s Vietnam Center, and John Jay College.This book includes excerpts from the above titles along with subsequent articles and transcripts of interviews on a range of current topics, with a view to shedding light on the systemic dimensions of the CIA&#x2019;s ongoing illegal and extra-legal activities. These terrorism and drug law enforcement articles and interviews illustrate how the CIA&#x2019;s activities impact social and political movements abroad and in the United States.A common theme is the CIA&#x2019;s ability to deceive and propagandize the American public through its impenetrable government-sanctioned shield of official secrecy and plausible deniability.Though investigated by the Church Committee in 1975, CIA praxis then continues to inform CIA praxis now. Valentine tracks its steady infiltration into practices targeting the last population to be subjected to the exigencies of the American empire: the American people.</p><p>Douglas Valentine is an American journalist and author of four works of historical non-fiction: The Hotel Tacloban, The Phoenix Program, The Strength of the Wolf (winner of the Choice Academic Library Award), and The Strength of the Pack.His articles appear regularly in CounterPunch, ConsortiumNews,.. Portions of his research materials are archived at the National Security Archive (both a Vietnam Collection and a separate Drug Enforcement Collection), Texas Tech University&#39;s Vietnam Center, and John Jay College. He provided expert testimony at the King v Jowers trial on MLK assassinationIn the wake of September 11, 2001, my articles about the Phoenix program became more relevant than ever before. The third, "Homeland Insecurity," appeared on October 1, 2001, and predicted that the government would establish Phoenix-style "extra-legal military tribunals that can try suspected terrorists without the ordinary legal constraints of American justice."<br><br>The United States soon established detention centers at Guant�namo in Cuba, Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan, and at the infamous Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. And the CIA established "black sites" around the world. But I was referring to plans by the Bush administration to rob American citizens of their right to due process. And that is exactly what happened in January 2013 when President Obama signed a National Defense Authorization Act that provides for the indefinite detention of Americans.<br><br>These developments were easy to predict, given my back-ground in Phoenix. In the October 2001 article, for example, I explained that Phoenix would become the bureaucratic model for the "homeland security" program that now envelops America and subjects its citizens to the same blanket surveillance that the Phoenix program imposed on the people of South Vietnam. Almost ten years later, in July 2011, the Washington Post published its "Top Secret America" expos�, which outlined America's "heavily privatized military-corporate-intelligence establishment." Lead reporter Dana Priest calls it the "vast and hidden apparatus of the war on terror."<br><br>This Phoenix-style network constitutes America's internal security apparatus, and it is targeting you, under the guise of protecting you from terrorism. And that is why, more than ever, people need to understand what Phoenix is really all about.<br><br>When the CIA created Phoenix in June 1967, it was called ICEX-SIDE: Intelligence Coordination and Exploitation&#x2013;Screening, Interrogation and Detention of the Enemy. The SIDE function is often ignored as journalists and propagandists focus on the sensational aspect that involves the targeted assassination of terrorists and their sympathizers, often by remote-controlled drones.<br><br>But in the first instance, Phoenix was a massive dragnet that packed South Vietnam's prisons, jails, and detention centers to overflowing. The foundation stone of this network was a jerry-rigged judicial system based on Stalinist security courts that did not require evidence to convict a person. People charged with national security violations had no right to legal representation, due process, or habeas corpus.<br><br>As Johan Galtung taught us, "Personal violence is for the amateur in dominance, structural violence is the tool of the professional. The amateur who wants to dominate uses guns; the professional uses social structure."<br><br>It was perfectly clear, following the terror attacks of 9/11, that America's elite were creating exactly this kind of criminally legal social structure. Climate change, overpopulation, income inequality, dwindling resources, and other geopolitical factors are pushing the rich into gated communities in every nation in the world. <br><br>The establishment is preparing for the dystopian future that lies ahead.</p><h2>The Beekeeper&#39;s Handbook</h2><p><p>Since 1973, tens of thousands of first-time and experienced beekeepers alike have relied on <em>The Beekeeper's Handbook</em> as the best single-volume guide to the hobby and profession of beekeeping.

He writes that certain variant genes can increase a person's susceptibility to depression, anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and antisocial, sociopathic, or violent behaviors. But rather than seeing this "risk" gene as a liability, Boyce, through his daring research, has recast the way we think of human frailty, and has shown that while these "bad" genes can create problems, they can also, <i>in the right setting and the right environment</i>, result in producing children who not only do better than before but far exceed their peers. Orchid children, Boyce makes clear, are not failed dandelions; they are a different category of child, with special sensitivities and strengths, and need to be nurtured and taught in special ways. And in <i>The Orchid and the Dandelion</i>, Boyce shows us how to understand these children for their unique sensibilities, their considerable challenges, their remarkable gifts.</p><p>W.

Easy-to-use facing-page format.</p><p>Roger Tory Peterson, one of America's pre-eminent artist-naturalists and arguably the inventor of the field guide, made people love birds like no one since John James Audubon. <i>A Field Guide to the Birds</i>, first published in 1934, remains his most famous and wonderful work. The manual stood instantly apart from the dichotomous keys zoologists used to identify species, since Peterson grouped paintings of related species together and used arrows to, as he explained, "pinpoint the key field marks." This way, watchers could spot birds from a distance and avoid, as he archly put it, "the bird-in-hand characters that the early collectors relied on." Birders could use the guide where they needed it most--outdoors--on living birds flitting quickly by. In addition to detailed illustrations, Peterson offers charming (and useful) descriptions of each avian citizen's appearance, behavior, voice, and range. There is also priceless anecdotal information, based on decades of field experience, as in this description of the common house sparrow (<i>Passer domesticus</i>): "Familiar to everyone. Sooty city birds often bear little resemblance to clean country males with the black throat, white cheeks, chestnut nape." His transliterations of song are just as quietly marvelous. For instance, <i>Pluvialis squatarola</i>, or the black-bellied plover, makes things clear with "a plaintive slurred whistle, <i>tlee-oo-eee</i> or <i>whee-er-ee</i> (middle note lower)."<p> Peterson's original handbook covered birds of Eastern North America, and has since been followed by guides to Western birds, animal tracks, butterflies, and many other natural wonders. He and his team updated "The Birders' Bible" as new species were discovered and classifications modified. Generations of enthusiastic watchers owe Peterson a debt of gratitude for making ornithology accessible. But equally important, he showed scientists that finding beauty in living animals, and not just cataloging the measurements of dead ones, was crucial. Roger Tory Peterson died in 1996. He will be remembered as a passionate naturalist, a keen observer of living things, and a gifted artist and teacher. <i>--Therese Littleton</i></p>Roger Tory Peterson, one of the world&#39;s greatest naturalists, received every major award for ornithology, natural science, and conservation, as well as numerous honorary degrees, medals, and citations, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The Peterson Identification System has been called the greatest invention since binoculars, and the Peterson Field Guides� are credited with helping to set the stage for the environmental movement.</p><h2>101 Textures in Colored Pencil: Practical step-by-step drawing techniques for rendering a variety of surfaces &amp; textures</h2><p><b>Get a feel for your art&#x2014;literally! <i>101 Textures in Colored Pencil</i>&nbsp;teaches you every technique you&#x2019;ll need to give your colored-pencil drawings realistic, palpable texture.</b><br><br> There has never been a better opportunity to master textures.

Spanning from 3,500 B.C.E. to the present, this unique guide is written by an all-star team of architectural experts in their fields who emphasize the connections, contrasts, and influences of architectural movements throughout history. The architectural history of the world comes to life through a unified framework for interpreting and understanding architecture, supplemented by rich drawings from the renowned Frank Ching as well as brilliant photographs.<br> <br> Architecture and art history enthusiasts will find A Global History of Architecture perpetually at their fingertips.</p><p><b>FRANCIS D.K. CHING</b> is Professor of Architecture at the University of Washington. He is the author of numerous architecture and design books, including Architecture: Form, Space, and Order; Architectural Graphics; Interior Design Illustrated; and Building Construction Illustrated, all from Wiley. <p><b>MARK M. JARZOMBEK</b> is Director of History, Theory, and Criticism of Architecture and Art, Professor of the History of Architecture at MIT, and author of several books with university presses.</p> <p><b>VIKRAMADITYA PRAKASH</b> is Chair and Associate Professor of Architecture at the University of Washington and the author of several academic publications.</p>"...the work offers a fresh and engaging outlook for an architectural history survey course. It affords the student an opportunity to view architecture differently and make connections that might not otherwise be apparent." (<i>American Reference Books Annual</i>, 2008) <p>"...it constitutes a wonderful and interesting read in its own right, and because of its exceptionally wide perspective, even architectural historians who do not teach general survey courses are likely to enjoy and appreciate it." (<i>Annali d'architecthura</i>, 2008)</p> <p>"Not only does <i>A Global History of Architecture</i> own the territory [of world architecture], it pulls off this audacious task with panache, intelligence and -- for the most part -- grace. The slices of time in <i>A Global History</i> provide a richer learning experience for an introductory course." (<i>Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians</i>, 2008)</p> <p>"The book's most informative and attractive feature is its illustrations, hundreds of drawings by Ching, a noted author and architectural illustrator." (<i>Choice</i>, March 2007)</p> <p>A decade after the 100th anniversary of Banister Fletcher's venerable and indispensable <i>A History of Architecture</i> (20th ed.) comes this fresh, one-volume historical encyclopedia of world architecture. Ching (architecture, Univ. of Washington; <i>Architecture: Form, Space, and Order</i>), Mark M. Jarzombek (architecture &amp; art, MIT), and Vikramaditya Prakash (architecture, Univ. of Washington) recast the story of the last 5000 years of building into a simple but brilliantly workable chronological schema of "timecuts," flexible time spans growing shorter and denser as we reach the present. These timecuts succeed in facilitating cross-cultural analysis and minimizing Eurocentric bias. Best of all, they prevent yet another rehash of architectural history as a monotonous procession of endless and unconnected styles, periods, and places. Thus, the Forbidden City, Topkapi Palace, and Villa Medici are viewed as phenomena interdependent upon international trade routes and as outgrowths of an emergent "global urbanism." Fifteenhundred elegant and superbly legible hand drawings by Ching, along with 1000 photographs and maps, illustrate a lucid and engaging text. Something of a hybrid, this is as much a solid reference resource as a revisionist textbook. Essential for most collections.<br> &#x2014;David Solt�sz, Cuyahoga Cty.

More manifesto than polite discussion, more call to action than criticism, <i>The Invisible Dragon</i> aims squarely at the hyper-institutionalism that, in Hickey&#x2019;s view, denies the real pleasures that draw us to art in the first place. Deploying the artworks of Warhol, Raphael, Caravaggio, and Mapplethorpe and the writings of Ruskin, Shakespeare, Deleuze, and Foucault, Hickey takes on museum culture, arid academicism, sclerotic politics, and more&#x2014;all in the service of making readers rethink the nature of art. A new introduction provides a context for earlier essays&#x2014;what Hickey calls his "intellectual temper tantrums." A new essay, "American Beauty," concludes the volume with a historical argument that is a rousing paean to the inherently democratic nature of attention to beauty.</p> <p>Written with a verve that is all too rare in serious criticism, this expanded and refurbished edition of <i>The Invisible Dragon</i> will be sure to captivate a new generation of readers, provoking the passionate reactions that are the hallmark of great criticism.</p> <p></p></p><p>This is a pithy collection of essays on the nature, meaning, and destiny of beauty in the late 20th century. For such a slender volume (just 64 pages), the broad scope of these essays covers a lot of ground. Dave Hickey discusses the work of Raphael, Andy Warhol, Caravaggio, and Michel Foucault, traversing centuries of ideas about aesthetics, sexuality, religion, and culture. Hickey, a professor of art criticism and theory at the University of Nevada and the author of a book of short fiction, boldly ventures to compare Robert Mapplethorpe's <i>X Portfolio</i> to Shakespeare's <i>Sonnets</i>. A delight for the mind.<p></p><b>Dave Hickey</b>&nbsp;writes cultural criticism. He is former executive editor of&nbsp;<i>Art in America </i>and the author of <i>Air Guitar</i>.

By the author of DTja Dead. 300,000 first printing.</p><p>Temperance Brennan is a forensic anthropologist with one of the longest commutes in fiction--from North Carolina to Montreal. She works in both places, and in this third outing (after <i>D�j� Dead</i> and <i>Death du Jour</i>) she manages to make a riveting (if a bit too coincidental) connection between a skull in Montreal and the partial skeleton of a teenager--dead since 1984--in North Carolina. Linking them is a 9-year-old girl shot on a Montreal street, the victim of a war among members of an outlaw motorcycle gang in eastern Canada. Another piece of the puzzle is provided by Tempe's visiting nephew, who is fascinated by the biker culture and is drawn into the mystery Tempe's trying to solve:<p> </p><blockquote>"Know anything about Slick?" asked Kit.<p> "He doesn't look like the pick of the litter."</p><p> "Yeah, even from that motley litter." He flipped the picture. "Heck, this guy croaked when I was 3 years old."</p><p> There were two more photos of Slick's funeral, both taken from a distance, one at the cemetery, the other on the church steps. Many of the mourners wore caps riding their eyebrows, and bandannas stretched to cover their mouths.</p><p> "The one you've got must be from a private collection." I handed Kit the other pictures. "I think these two are police surveillance photos. Seems the bereaved weren't anxious to show their faces."</p></blockquote> The science is as accurate as the author can make it. Kathy Reichs's own background--as forensic anthropologist for the chief medical officer of North Carolina and director of forensic anthropology for the province of Quebec--ensures verisimilitude of place and procedure and creates a believable milieu. Fans of Patricia Cornwall will enjoy this solidly written suspense thriller, while those of a less scientific bent, who don't mind a somewhat lagging pace, will skip the details and concentrate on Reichs's fluid writing. All readers will enjoy the way Tempe puts the pieces of the puzzle, as well as the bodies, together. <i>--Jane Adams</i><b>Kathy Reichs</b> is forensic anthropologist for the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, State of North Carolina, and for the Laboratoire de Sciences Judiciaires et de M�decine L�gale for the province of Quebec.

She lives in South Texas.Grade 3-6-It's been 10 years since the queen defeated Rumpelstiltskin by speaking his name, but now he's back to demand repayment for all of the gold he spun for her so many years ago. If she does not oblige, he threatens to increase the pest population and make the kingdom's livestock and other assets disappear by multiplying with fractions. Rumpelstiltskin multiplies the king's nose by six and vows to do the same for the entire royal court, unless Peter, the queen's 10-year-old son, agrees to go with him to work off the debt. It's up to the young prince to take possession of the man's magical multiplying stick and learn how to use it in order to restore normalcy to the kingdom. Calvert has created an interesting vehicle for teaching children about the differences between multiplying with whole numbers and multiplying with fractions. While obviously an educational product, her presentation is creative. Unfortunately, the audience for this book is fairly specific, and, as such, is limited. Children who have not been exposed to these concepts will likely be confused by the math component of the story. In some areas, multiplication of fractions is not taught until the last years of elementary school, but the book's format is unlikely to appeal to them. It's unfortunate, because Calvert has written an enjoyable teaching tool, and Geehan's luminous and expressive paintings are perfect for this fairy-tale world.<i>-Carol L.

His case studies of broken minds offer brilliant insight into the mysteries of consciousness&#34;. (&#34;Guardian&#34;). In his most extraordinary book, Oliver Sacks recounts the stories of patients lost in the bizarre, apparently inescapable world of neurological disorders. These are case studies of people who have lost their memories and with them the greater part of their pasts; who are no longer able to recognize people or common objects; whose limbs have become alien; and, who are afflicted and yet are gifted with uncanny artistic or mathematical talents. In Dr Sacks&#39; splendid and sympathetic telling, each tale is a unique and deeply human study of life struggling against incredible adversity. &#34;Populated by a cast as strange as that of the most fantastic fiction ...Dr Sacks shows the awesome powers of our mind and just how delicately balanced they have to be&#34;. (&#34;Sunday Times&#34;). &#34;This book is for everybody who has felt from time to time that certain twinge of self-identity and sensed how easily, at any moment, one might lose it&#34;. (&#34;The Times&#34;). &#34;A gripping journey into the recesses of the human mind&#34;. (&#34;Daily Mail&#34;).</p><p>Oliver Sacks was born in 1933 in London and was educated at Queen&#39;s College, Oxford. He completed his medical training at San Francisco&#39;s Mount Zion Hospital and at UCLA before moving to New York, where he soon encountered the patients whom he would write about in his book Awakenings. Dr Sacks spent almost fifty years working as a neurologist and wrote many books, including The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat, Musicophilia, and Hallucinations, about the strange neurological predicaments and conditions of his patients. The New York Times referred to him as &#39;the poet laureate of medicine&#39;, and over the years he received many awards, including honours from the Guggenheim Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and the Royal College of Physicians. In 2008, he was appointed Commander of the British Empire. His memoir, On the Move, was published shortly before his death in August 2015.A neurologist who claims to be equally interested in disease and people, Sacks (Awakenings, etc.) explores neurological disorders with a novelist's skill and an appreciation of his patients as human beings. These cases, some of which have appeared in literary or medical publications, illustrate the tragedy of losing neurological facultiesmemory, powers of visualization, word-recognitionor the also-devastating fate of those suffering an excess of neurological functions causing such hyper states as chorea, tics, Tourette's syndrome and Parkinsonism. Still other patients experience organically based hallucinations, transports, visions, etc., usually deemed to be psychic in nature. The science of neurology, Sacks charges, stresses the abstract and computerized at the expense of judgment and emotional depthsin his view, the most important human qualities. Therapy for brain-damaged patients (by medication, accommodation, music or art) should, he asserts, be designed to help restore the essentially personal quality of the individual.

Based on her many years working in schools, professional counselor Phyllis Fagell sees these years instead as a critical stage that parents can't afford to ignore (and though "middle school" includes different grades in various regions, Fagell maintains that the ages make more of a difference than the setting). Though the transition from childhood to adolescence can be tough for kids, this time of rapid physical, intellectual, moral, social, and emotional change is a unique opportunity to proactively build character and confidence. <br>Fagell helps parents use the middle school years as a low-stakes training ground to teach kids the key skills they'll need to thrive now and in the future, including making good friend choices, negotiating conflict, regulating their own emotions, be their own advocates, and more. To answer parents' most common questions and struggles with middle school-aged children, Fagell combines her professional and personal expertise with stories and advice from prominent psychologists, doctors, parents, educators, school professionals, and middle schoolers themselves.</p><p><b>Phyllis Fagell </b>is a licensed clinical professional counselor, a certified professional school counselor, and a journalist. She has worked in both public and private schools with students in grades K-12, focusing on middle school for the last several years. She currently works full time as the school counselor for Sheridan School in Washington, D.C. She also provides therapy to children, teens and families in private practice."[Fagell's] advice is fresh and relevant, welcoming and welcomed."<br>&#x2015;<b><i><i>Chicago Tribune</i><br></i></b><br><br>"No one captures the magic, delight, struggle, and triumphs to be found in middle school like Phyllis Fagell. She knows middle school inside and out, and her advice is some of the best available for students, parents, and teachers."&#x2015;<b><i>Jessica Lahey, author of <i>The Gift of Failure</i></i></b><br><br>"<i>Middle School Matters </i>shines much-needed light on the fascinating -- and fraught -- middle school years. With the wisdom of a seasoned counselor and the relatability of a close friend, Phyllis Fagell offers an unflinching, reassuring, and indispensable guide to a pivotal time in parenting."&#x2015;<b><i>Lisa Damour, PhD, author of <i>Under Pressure </i>and <i>Untangled</i></i></b><br><br>"I love, love <i>Middle School Matters</i>!

This is the book parents have been waiting for since...forever. Parents have long been socialized to fear the middle school years as a time of great turmoil and never-ending drama, but Phyllis Fagell opens our eyes to the modern middle school student by sharing a powerful combination of current research, anecdotes from actual middle schoolers, and her own expertise as a middle school counselor. <i>Middle School Matters </i>is packed with helpful tips and actionable strategies to help your middle school student thrive instead of simply survive."&#x2015;<b><i>Katie Hurley, LCSW, author of <i>No More Mean Girls </i>and <i>The Happy Kid Handbook </i><br></i></b><br><br>"Middle School does matter!

Fagell writes clearly and concisely, offering practical suggestions and engaging anecdotes to illustrate her points. The conversation starters are excellent!"&#x2015;<b><i>Mary K. Alvord, PhD, psychologist and coauthor <i>Conquer Negative Thinking for Teens</i>, and <i>Resilience Builder Program for Children and Adolescence</i></i></b><br><br>"As a lifelong educator and the parent of two teens and a tween, I cannot recommend this book enough! I just wish <i>Middle School Matters</i> had been written when I was a superintendent and led a middle school transformation effort, as the ideas, advice and practical guidance are invaluable. Phyllis Fagell has done us all a great service by breaking down the middle school years into easily-understood concepts that parents and educators can use to work with early adolescents in any setting. Phyllis presents simple strategies and approaches to help students -- and adults -- navigate an amazingly complex and exciting time in their lives. I highly encourage teachers, principals, parents, policy makers and anyone interested in using the middle school years to lay the foundation for success in the teenage years and beyond to read and apply the lessons of this book now!"&#x2015;<b><i>Joshua P.

Inspired by Einstein, Coltrane put physics and geometry at the core of his music. <br><br>Physicist and jazz musician Stephon Alexander follows suit, using jazz to answer physics' most vexing questions about the past and future of the universe. Following the great minds that first drew the links between music and physics-a list including Pythagoras, Kepler, Newton, Einstein, and Rakim-<i>The Jazz of Physics</i> reveals that the ancient poetic idea of the Music of the Spheres," taken seriously, clarifies confounding issues in physics. <i><br><br>The Jazz of Physics</i> will fascinate and inspire anyone interested in the mysteries of our universe, music, and life itself.</p><p><b>Stephon Alexander</b> is a professor of physics at Brown University and the winner of the 2013 American Physical Society Edward A.

The authors, through their dialectical approach, provide a theoretical framework that allows for an efficient, realistic, and parsimonious approach to the core difficulties in multiple health-risk behaviors in youth. Most important, they provide clear guidelines as to how therapists should conduct themselves to be maximally effective with these challenging adolescents, and how to cope with the emotional demands of work with this population. What the reader will learn is that DBT is more than a set of skills and techniques--it is a way of understanding and conceptualizing human behavior.

Brent, MD, Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Services for Teens at Risk, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine<br><br>"I was struck by the discussion of how to conduct therapy with teens on an interpersonal level. I've never read a better, concise description of what it takes to work with adolescents....The treatment described is likely to be useful for a broad range of persistently and emotionally dysregulated adolescents, not just those who are suicidal....An important contribution to the literature on the treatment of self-destructive adolescents and their families." (<i>Psychiatric Services</i> 2008-03-01)<br><br>"Clinicians with and without expertise in dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) will find this book useful because it covers topics ranging from basic principles to details of session content, to treatment protocol modifications for this specialized population....The attention given to the role of families in this book is a feature that is not available in general DBT books....This book's greatest strength is the practical format in which information is presented. The chapters that outline treatment protocols provide detailed information about session process and content. Many practical figures, tables, and checklists are included. The addition of reproducible handouts and checklists that can actually be used in therapy is an added bonus. There is also an appendix of mindfulness exercises that most clinicians will find helpful....A comprehensive and practical book....This book will certainly help to facilitate future research because it provides the comprehensive structure necessary for those who will go on to conduct clinical trials."

(<i>Bulletin of the Menninger Clinic</i> 2007-06-01)<br><br>"This is an exciting and very important book that fills a need in the behavioral literature....The book is clearly written, full of examples and may represent the most comprehensive explanation of dialectical behavior therapy yet written. This book would be a valued addition to any advanced graduate level psychology or social work course in behavior therapy targeting adolescence or where suicidality is part of the curriculum. This book will also be a valued addition to any psychiatry residency or fellowship aligned with an adolescent treatment program. Given the importance of this book, its potential contribution and the high level of need of this targeted population, the price is a bargain!" (<i>Child &amp; Family Behavior Therapy</i> 2007-01-01)<br><br>"A remarkably well-written, comprehensive, theoretically-grounded, integrated treatment manual. It is excellent for researchers and clinicians alike&#x2014;as the most comprehensive and empirically-informed approach to treating suicidal adolescents developed by experts with this population....Notable throughout this manual is the compassionate stance taken by the authors in describing the symptoms and behaviors of the multiproblem adolescents and families served by dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) treatment....I highly recommend this treatment manual for all those working with adolescents." (<i>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Book Reviews</i> 2007-01-01)<br><br>"This book is a creative synthesis of the new and old that offers a useful treatment manual to be applied and further tested with the taxing population of suicidal adolescents....An excellent work....The ideas and tools are well explained, inviting application, skill building, and ultimately analysis of the effectiveness of this approach. This work goes a long way toward moving us forward in treating this most taxing dilemma of treating suicidal adolescents. This is a nice synthesis. Well done."

He is known from his book &#39;Friendly Fascism&#39; from 1980 and as primary author of the Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment Act. Gross was born in Philadelphia. He received his B.A. in English and Philosophy, and his M.A. in English literature from the University of Pennsylvania. In the late 1940s, he started as a federal bureaucrat in Washington. From 1941 to 1945 he was a staff member of a number of Senate committees. Here he wrote the Roosevelt-Truman full employment bills of 1944 and 1945, which led to the Employment Act of 1946. From 1946 to 1952 he was executive secretary of the President&#39;s Council of Economic Advisers. In the 1950s, he moved with his family to Israel, where he served as an economic advisor in the Prime Minister&#39;s Office and as a Visiting Professor at the Hebrew University, where he established their program in Public Administration. He returned to the United States in the 1960s and joined the faculty of Syracuse University in the Maxwell School. In 1961-62, he was a Fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, Palo Alto; and, in 1962-63, he was the Leatherbee Lecturer at the Harvard Business School. In 1970, Bertram Gross was president of the Society for General Systems Research. From 1970 to 1982 he was Distinguished Professor of Political Science and Urban Affairs at Hunter College and the CUNY Graduate Center.<p>At a time of escalating political uncertainty, when the forces of totalitarianism threaten once more to crawl out of the American woodwork, Friendly Fascism is a powerful tool- better yet, a weapon- that can help us avert a distinctly unfriendly future. - Alvin Toffler</p><p>First-rate...a fascinating, provocative job.

He adds detail and emotion about his youth in rural Georgia that he described in his magnificent <i>An Hour Before Daylight</i>. He writes about racism and the isolation of the Carters. He describes the brutality of the hazing regimen at Annapolis, and how he nearly lost his life twice serving on submarines and his amazing interview with Admiral Rickover. He describes the profound influence his mother had on him, and how he admired his father even though he didn&#x2019;t emulate him. He admits that he decided to quit the Navy and later enter politics without consulting his wife, Rosalynn, and how appalled he is in retrospect.<br> <br>In <i>A Full Life</i>, Carter tells what he is proud of and what he might do differently. He discusses his regret at losing his re-election, but how he and Rosalynn pushed on and made a new life and second and third rewarding careers. He is frank about the presidents who have succeeded him, world leaders, and his passions for the causes he cares most about, particularly the condition of women and the deprived people of the developing world.<br> <br>This is a wise and moving look back from this remarkable man. Jimmy Carter has lived one of our great American lives&#x2014;from rural obscurity to world fame, universal respect, and contentment. <i>A Full Life</i> is an extraordinary read.</p><p>Jimmy Carter was the thirty-ninth President of the United States, serving from 1977 to 1981.

My mother was Bessie Lillian Gordy, and I knew all her intimate relatives and many of her distant cousins. We would sometimes drive after church services to Richland, her hometown, to have dinner with her close-knit family, where the table conversation often led to an explosion of emotions and angry departures. My father was James Earl Carter, and I never knew even his close cousins who lived in the county seat just nine miles from our home in Plains. It seemed that the Carters were not interested in each other.<br> <br>During my first year as president, leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints came to the White House and presented me with a genealogical study of my Carter family. The information went back thirteen generations, to the early 1600s, and included birth, death, and marriage records, land deeds, and data from some of the early courthouse proceedings that involved legal disputes. I put it all in a big box and sent it to our home in Plains. After leaving the White House I bought my first computer and entered the Mormon research data when I was sent the first edition of a software program called Family Tree Maker. My wife Rosalynn&#x2019;s family always had three reunions each year (there would have been four if two Smiths hadn&#x2019;t married each other), so in 1998 I decided to have a reunion of the direct descendants of my great-great-grandfather Wiley Carter, on what would have been his two hundredth birthday. More than 950 people came, and I corrected mistakes in my family records and brought them up to date. More recently, I gave the data to our son Jeffrey, and he has published a much more definitive study, Ancestors of Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter, focusing on our time in America.<br> <br>These were rough pioneer days as immigrants struggled for existence or preeminence, and even our more recent family history was, to a surprising degree, shaped by violence. Wiley Carter (1798&#x2013;1864) was deputized in a sheriff&#x2019;s posse in Wilkes County when he shot and killed a man named Usry. There was a routine one-day trial, and the sheriff testified, &#x201c;Usry was evidently preparing to shoot Carter. The two men were cursing each other and both raised their guns about the same time and fired. Usry was killed.&#x201d; Wiley was found not guilty of murder because the victim was armed and threatening. However, it was known that there had been a long history of ill will between the two men, and after the trial a lot of resentment was stirred up in the community by Usry&#x2019;s family and friends. After Wiley&#x2019;s wife, Ann, delivered her eleventh child and died, Wiley remarried and moved to a farm about ten miles north of where the town of Plains is located. He had traded for the land with an original owner, who won it in a lottery that was held in 1833, after Indians had been forced to leave West Georgia in the late 1820s. Wiley&#x2019;s second wife had another son, who moved to Texas.<br> <br>Wiley&#x2019;s fourth son, Littleberry Walker Carter (1829&#x2013;1873), was my great-grandfather. He served with two of his brothers as artillerymen in the Confederate army. They fought in twenty-one battles and finally left the service in Florida, a month after Lee surrendered at Appomattox. He then bought and operated a farm just west of Americus that later became Souther Field (now Jimmy Carter Regional Airport), where Charles Lindbergh made his first solo flight. He was killed &#x201c;in an argument over the proceeds of a flying jenny [merry-go-round]&#x201d; in 1873, as recorded in the county newspaper.<br> <br>Known as Billy, his son and my grandfather William Archibald Carter (1858&#x2013;1903) moved in 1888 about fifty miles south to a rural community known as Rowena, where he was a farmer, operated two sawmills and a winery, and owned a cotton gin. He was small but tough. One time when he was harvesting sugarcane, his machete was deflected into his thigh, inflicting a deep gash. Billy used his belt to stop the flow of blood, sent to the house for a needle and thread, sewed up the wound, and resumed work. He was shot and killed in a fight with a man named Will Taliaferro, in an altercation over a desk stolen by Taliaferro from Billy&#x2019;s cotton gin. After his property was sold, Billy&#x2019;s family moved back to Plains and purchased a farm in nearby Webster County in 1904, which my father, Earl Carter, became responsible for operating as a teenager. I can only imagine the multiple skills needed to perform all the duties of my ancestors, and it may be that my inclination to pursue new ideas and to design and create things in my woodshop is inherited from them.<br> <br>My mother, Lillian Gordy, left her job as a postal clerk in Richland and moved eighteen miles to Plains (population about five hundred) in 1920 to become a registered nurse. She married Earl when she finished her training, in 1923. I was born in October 1924, and our family lived in a house on South Bond Street with Edgar and Allie Smith as next-door neighbors. Edgar was the only automobile mechanic in the community, and directly across the street from his shop my father owned and operated a small general store after completing military service as a first lieutenant in World War I. The Smiths&#x2019; daughter Rosalynn was born in August 1927, and my mother later told me that I was taken to the house next door and peeked into the cradle to see the newest baby on the street. Our families were very close, and Rosalynn&#x2019;s younger sister was named for Mama, who nursed Rosalynn&#x2019;s father during his terminal illness with leukemia. Daddy became a full-time farmer in 1928, when I was four years old. I was raised on a farm he bought about two and a half miles west of Plains in the rural community known as Archery.<br> Archery<p></p> <br>My boyhood home in Archery was a Sears, Roebuck house that had been built six years before our family occupied it. At that time the Sears catalogue offered homes of several sizes, with three basic options: (1) all the components of a complete house and the tools needed to construct it, loaded into a single railroad boxcar with plans and instructions; (2) everything needed for a house except the lumber; and (3) just the plans and instructions, practically free but requiring doors, windows, hardware, and other parts that were sold by Sears. We learned later that our home was one of the second options, since genetic testing showed that its wooden frame and siding had come from trees harvested on the farm.</p><h2>Living With the Dead: Twenty Years on the Bus With Garcia and the Grateful Dead</h2><p>The Grateful Dead&#39;s longtime manager provides an entertaining eyewitness account of the band&#39;s behind-the-scenes history, from the writing of their greatest songs and their legendary encounters with other celebrities to their emergence as cultural icons. 200,000 first printing. $150,000 ad/promo.</p><p>Rock Scully worked for the Grateful Dead for twenty years and lives in Marino del Rey, California. David Dalton, co-author of <i>Faithfull: An Autobiography</i> and <i>Rock 100</i> (both published by Cooper Square Press), lives in Delhi, New York.Scully's 20-year tenure as Grateful Dead manager ended on a sour note, and he is barely mentioned in other books on the band. Nonetheless, in this first in-depth biography of the group, he displays a vivid, unflinching eye for detail, which is surprising considering the prodigious amounts of drugs he (and they) ingested. Highlights include colorful descriptions of Ken Kesey's acid tests (for which the Dead were the house band) and life in the Haight-Ashbury scene of the late 1960s. The reverential depiction of the late Jerry Garcia dominates sketches of the other band members, but Scully's insider status gives readers a rare view into the Grateful Dead inner circle. Recommended for popular music collections. Not as essential but no less interesting is editor Ganz's (Playing in the Band, LJ 7/85) compilation of some of the heartfelt and eloquent Internet postings that started appearing within minutes of the announcement of Garcia's death on August 9, 1995. Lovingly assembled, this book is far more effective than Linda Kelly's recently published Deadheads (LJ 11/1/95) at helping the uninitiated understand the otherworldly bond between the Dead and their fans.

Beyond his psychic gifts, Van Praagh has a gift for simplifying complex spiritual ideas and writing about them in a conversational tone. Most appealing for Van Praagh fans are his detailed theories on death and the afterlife. For example, when people die sudden deaths, Van Praagh reports, spirits of the dead often linger over their bodies, unable to comprehend what has happened (but still able to see and hear everything that is being done and said around the corpse). This is why spirits of the already-deceased are so useful in helping the dead transition to the other side.<p> Speaking of the afterlife, or heaven, Van Praagh writes: </p><blockquote>In the higher realms everyone is on the same level of spiritual understanding, like a symphony of beings in tune with one another. For some this may mean a reunion with members of their earth family. For others it could be a meeting with former friends and lovers from previous incarnations.</blockquote> Finally, Van Praagh returns to his fascinating stories of channeling the deceased to illustrate how the living can stay on task with their raison d'�tre. If we want to help our souls along on their eternal journeys toward enlightenment, then we must remove the emotional obstacles that are blocking their paths, says Van Praagh, who devotes entire chapters to guilt, fear, forgiveness, and love. <i>--Gail Hudson</i><b>James Van Praagh</b>&nbsp;is a world-famous medium who is renowned for conveying messages and conversations between the physical and spiritual realms. He is the author of the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestsellers&nbsp;<i>Reaching To Heaven </i>and&nbsp;<i>Talking To Heaven, </i>which sold close to 600,000 copies in hardcover.&nbsp;Although he was raised a Roman Catholic and even entered a seminary at 14, he soon found that "spirituality" was more compelling than "religion." He graduated from San Francisco State University with a degree in broadcasting and communication, then moved to Los Angeles, where at age 24, he met a medium who told him that within two years, he himself would become clairvoyant.

Olbrechts-Tyteca, and they rely, in particular, for their theory of argumentation on the twin concepts of universal and particular audiences: while every argument is directed to a specific individual or group, the orator decides what information and what approaches will achieve the greatest adherence according to an ideal audience. This ideal, Perelman explains, can be embodied, for example, "in God, in all reasonable and competent men, in the man deliberating or in an elite.&#x201d; Like particular audiences, then, the universal audience is never fixed or absolute but depends on the orator, the content and goals of the argument, and the particular audience to whom the argument is addressed. These considerations determine what information constitutes "facts" and "reasonableness" and thus help to determine the universal audience that, in turn, shapes the orator's approach. The adherence of an audience is also determined by the orator's use of values, a further key concept of the&nbsp;New Rhetoric. Perelman's treatment of value and his view of epideictic rhetoric sets his approach apart from that of the ancients and of Aristotle in particular. Aristotle's division of rhetoric into three genres&#x2013;forensic, deliberative, and epideictic&#x2013;is largely motivated by the judgments required for each: forensic or legal arguments require verdicts on past action, deliberative or political rhetoric seeks judgment on future action, and epideictic or ceremonial rhetoric concerns values associated with praise or blame and seeks no specific decisions. For Aristotle, the epideictic genre was of limited importance in the civic realm since it did not concern facts or policies. Perelman, in contrast, believes not only that epideictic rhetoric warrants more attention, but that the values normally limited to that genre are in fact central to all argumentation. "Epideictic oratory," Perelman argues, "has significant and important argumentation for strengthening the disposition toward action by increasing adherence to the values it lauds.&#x201d; These values are central to the persuasiveness of arguments in all rhetorical genres since the orator always attempts to "establish a sense of communion centered around particular values recognized by the audience.&#x201d;</p><p>Cha�m Perelman (1912&#x2013;1984), a Polish-born philosopher of law, studied, taught, and lived most of his life in Brussels.

From 1881 to 1932, vaudeville was at the heart of show business in the States. Its stars were America's first stars in the modern sense, and it utterly dominated American popular culture. Writer and modern-day vaudevillian Trav S.D. chronicles vaudeville's far-reaching impact in<i> No Applause--Just Throw Money</i>. He explores the many ways in which vaudeville's story is the story of show business in America and documents the rich history and cultural legacy of our country's only purely indigenous theatrical form, including its influence on everything from USO shows to Ed Sullivan to The Muppet Show and The Gong Show. More than a quaint historical curiosity, vaudeville is thriving today, and Trav S.D. pulls back the curtain on the vibrant subculture that exists across the United States--a vast grassroots network of fire-eaters, human blockheads, burlesque performers, and bad comics intent on taking vaudeville into its second century.<br></p><p><b>Trav S.D.</b> is top banana at the American Vaudeville Theatre. His writing has appeared in <i>The Village Voice, American Theatre, Time Out New York</i>, and <i>Reason.</i><br>Excerpted from <i>No Applause&#x2014;Just Throw Money</i> by Trav S.D.

But, as Poe observed, burials can be...premature. My contention is that this quintessentially American form of entertainment, which had been ubiquitous for half a century, only <i>seemed</i> to pass away in the early 1930s, yet in reality kept on kicking.<br><br>First, it lived on in the aesthetics and attitudes of its most successful veterans, some of whom (George Burns, Bob Hope, Milton Berle) continued to influence American pop culture into the 1980s. Certainly the first decade of talkies (as Henry Jenkins has observed in <i>What Made Pistachio Nuts</i>?) was dominated by the vaudevillian sensibility, as were USO shows in the Second World War, television variety shows from the 1940s through the seventies, and&#x2014;eternally, it seems&#x2014;stage shows in Las Vegas. But, second, vaudeville, like a phoenix, appears to be rising from the ashes, with scores, perhaps hundreds, of new variety venues popping up at alternative theaters and nightclubs throughout the nation. For a growing subculture of young people at least, vaudeville is back. So, while vaudeville as an institution may have passed away seventy years ago, its ghost has continued to haunt us thereafter, and has even possessed the souls of the living in order to walk the earth again. Not only do <i>Abbot and Costello Meet the Mummy</i>...but in a certain sense Abbot and Costello (and performers like them) <i>are</i> the mummy!<br><br>And yet as potent as this resurgence is among performers, I suspect that most people in the mainstream of society remain unaware of the historical importance&#x2014;let alone the history&#x2014;of vaudeville. Vaudeville utterly dominated American popular culture during its formative years at the turn of the last century. When Groucho Marx and Charlie Chaplin were born, vaudeville (in the form of its precursors, variety and music hall) had already been going strong for decades. Some of the most popular twentieth-century vaudevillians were alive until quite recently. One could make the argument that the story of American show business <i>is</i> the story of vaudeville...and yet that story is quite forgotten. (Just how utterly it has been covered by the sands of time is manifested to me in the blank and uncomprehending faces of some of the people to whom I have confided my work as master of ceremonies of my own vaudeville show. The telling and terrifying response&#x2014;&#x201c;Vaudeville? What&#x2019;s that?&#x201d;&#x2014;has chilled my blood on occasion, making me feel like Charlton Heston encountering the half-buried Statue of Liberty in the final scene of <i>Planet of the Apes</i>. &#x201c;You fools!&#x201d; I want to scream. &#x201c;You blew it up!&#x201d;)<br><br>Despite our contemporary amnesia, the fact remains that for approximately fifty years&#x2014;the period spanning 1881 to 1932&#x2014;vaudeville was the heart of American show business. Its stars were America&#x2019;s first stars in the modern sense. People all over the country knew their names, read about them in magazines. Children collected their playing cards. If you were beyond the reach of vaudeville, then you were really in the sticks.<br><br>An illustration of just how influential vaudeville was in the popular culture may be obtained by tracing the evolution of a single stage and screen property and marking the number of vaudevillians attached to it. Because it was my favorite movie as a child, and the prime mover of the lifelong journey that led me to this book, I choose <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>. Two years after the publication of L. Frank Baum&#x2019;s children&#x2019;s book, the story was turned into a Broadway vehicle starring vaudeville&#x2019;s premier eccentric dance team, Dave Montgomery and Fred Stone (who played the Tin Man and the Scarecrow, respectively). The latter&#x2019;s performance inspired a young Ray Bolger both to become a dancer and to stop at nothing to play the same role someday. A 1925 film version starred one of the silent screen&#x2019;s biggest comedy stars, Larry Semon, a second-generation vaudevillian. (In this drastically rewritten version, Semon plays a farmhand who disguises himself as a scarecrow. The production also features a pre-Laurel Oliver Hardy.) The 1939 MGM version, however, is the mother lode. Every single principal cast member with the exceptions of Margaret Hamilton (the Wicked Witch of the West) and Clara Blandick (Aunt Em) had been in vaudeville: not only the aforementioned Bolger (who played Scarecrow), but also Jack Haley (Tin Man), Bert Lahr (Cowardly Lion), Judy Garland (Dorothy), Billie Burke (Glinda), Frank Morgan (the Wizard), Charley Grapewin (Uncle Henry), and even Singer&#x2019;s Midgets (the Munchkins, of course). Dancer Buddy Ebsen, cast first as the Scarecrow, then as the Tin Man, then released due to illness, was a vaudeville veteran, as was W. C. Fields, orginally up for the part of the Wizard. (A character who, incidentally, seems not a little based on P. T. Barnum and the many medicine-show hustlers L. Frank Baum no doubt encountered during the years he spent living out west. As we shall see, such &#x201c;humbugs&#x201d; would play a major role in the genesis of vaudeville.) Producer Mervyn LeRoy had been a singer in vaudeville. Edgar Allan Woolf, an important author of vaudeville playlets, was one of the principal screenwriters, and Harold Arlen, who co-wrote the songs, had played in vaudeville jazz bands. Over the years, many attempts have been made to recapture the magic of that 1939 film in sequels. All have failed miserably and the reason why should be obvious. The &#x201c;school&#x201d; that produced those incredible artist is no more.*<br><br>The watchword of vaudeville was variety. The opposite of a variety show, you might say, is a &#x201c;monotony show.&#x201d; Twelve hours of monks chanting the same mantra over and over again&#x2014;that&#x2019;s monotony. Twelve <i>minutes</i> of monks chanting the same mantra, clad in fabulous silken outfits, accompanied by &#x201c;mysterious&#x201d; dry-ice smoke and a very Chinese-sounding gong, preceded by a man who plays the vibes with his toes, and succeeded by a barbershop quartet...that&#x2019;s variety.<br><br>In this post-MTV, post-postmodern, attention-deficit-ridden age of electronics-induced schizophrenia, I make bold to suggest that few of us will have a problem with this &#x201c;fractured&#x201d; aesthetic. Most of us have not only grown comfortable with the idea of watching a singer-followed-by-a-dancer-followed-by a-stupid-pet-trick but can also somehow manage to digest the inclusion of a car wreck, a baseball game, and a panel of old white men arguing about politics. Would it were ever thus. A hundred years ago, when variety entertainment was enjoying a golden age, some critics made the willfully blind error of deploring it for the very features for which it was so beloved. Typical are the observations of social scientist Michael Marks Davis, who wrote the following in a 1911 treatise. <i>The Exploitation of Pleasure: A Study of Commercial Recreations in </i><i>New York City</i>:<br><br>The humorous, sentimental, acrobatic and musical &#x201c;acts&#x201d; pass in succession like the grinning figures at a shooting gallery. Some are wholly crude, a few are decidedly clever; the majority are trite and empty; and as a whole there is no imagination behind their creation, and still less in the manager&#x2019;s mind to enforce their harmonious combination....Vaudeville...may be described as a succession of acts whose stimulus depends usually upon an artificial rather than a natural, human, and developing interest; these acts having no necessary and as a rule no actual connection.<br><br>Davis makes the critical mistake, common for his day, of measuring the variety show against the &#x201c;dramatic&#x201d; theater, with its Aristotelian laws of structure and development. But vaudeville (and the other variety arts) never were, and never claimed to be, any such animal. It is its own form, with its own laws. One minute it is a concert; the next a freak show; the next a one-act play; the next a gymnastics display.

Drawing on folktales and myths from many cultures and spiritual ideas from the East and West, he leads us to an undeniable truth: that the only story we came here to live is our own. Meade shows how the limitations of family and fate form the inner threads from which our individual destiny must emerge. He explains how our wounds can become doorways to our deepest gifts, and how our greatest efforts in the world are intended to lead us to a treasure divinely seeded within us before birth. Fate and Destiny speaks directly to young people looking to find a genuine path in life and trying to awaken to the dream they carry inside. It offers penetrating insights for those caught in life s inevitable struggles and shows how the wisdom of elders depends upon re-membering the spirit of eternal youth. As one story puts it, god has only one question to ask you at the end of life: did you become yourself? Weaving stories within stories, lacing pertinent psychology within cultural analysis, and mixing autobiography with myth, Meade opens the territory of fate and destiny to new interpretations and deeper meanings.</p><p>Weaving stories within stories, lacing pertinent psychology within cultural analysis, and mixing autobiography with myth, Michael Meade opens the territory of fate and destiny to new interpretations and deeper meanings leading us to an undeniable truth: that the only story we came here to live is our own.&#x201c;At the age of thirteen Michael became a lover of myth.

Here is accurate and fascinating information about their lives throughout the year, as they raise their young and look for food. Color photos enrich the text that reveals the unique ecosystem on which the ponies depend. Completely revised Spring 2018.</p><p>Grade 1-4-- In a nature tour format, the authors portray the seasons of this famous island. They present facts about the area's ecology while focusing on the ponies. The tone is conversational, written in an informal style and defining equine terms in context. One or two full-color photos on each page show the animals in their habitat. Scenes show both the natural beauty of the island and the ponies in action, sometimes in humorous poses. Photos and text promote Assateague's wildness while cautioning readers about humankind's effects on the fragile environment.

First published in 1918, and set in Nebraska in the late 19th century, this tale of the spirited daughter of a Bohemian immigrant family planning to farm on the untamed land ("not a country at all but the material out of which countries are made") comes to us through the romantic eyes of Jim Burden. He is, at the time of their meeting, newly orphaned and arriving at his grandparents' neighboring farm on the same night her family strikes out to make good in their new country. Jim chooses the opening words of his recollections deliberately: "I first heard of �ntonia on what seemed to be an interminable journey across the great midland plain of North America," and it seems almost certain that readers of Cather's masterpiece will just as easily pinpoint the first time they heard of �ntonia and her world. It seems equally certain that they, too, will remember that moment as one of great light in an otherwise unremarkable trip through the world.<p> �ntonia, who, even as a grown woman somewhat downtrodden by circumstance and hard work, "had not lost the fire of life," lies at the center of almost every human condition that Cather's novel effortlessly untangles. She represents immigrant struggles with a foreign land and tongue, the restraints on women of the time (with which Cather was very much concerned), the more general desires for love, family, and companionship, and the great capacity for forbearance that marked the earliest settlers on the frontier.</p><p> As if all this humanity weren't enough, Cather paints her descriptions of the vastness of nature--the high, red grass, the road that "ran about like a wild thing," the endless wind on the plains--with strokes so vivid as to make us feel in our bones that we've just come in from a walk on that very terrain ourselves. As the story progresses, Jim goes off to the University in Lincoln to study Latin (later moving on to Harvard and eventually staying put on the East Coast in another neat encompassing of a stage in America's development) and learns Virgil's phrase "<i>Optima dies ... prima fugit</i>" that Cather uses as the novel's epigraph. "The best days are the first to flee"--this could be said equally of childhood and the earliest hours of this country in which the open land, much like <i>My �ntonia</i>, was nothing short of a rhapsody in prairie sky blue. <i>--Melanie Rehak</i></p>Founded in 1906 by J.M.

This is the story of Lin Kong, a man living in two worlds, struggling with the conflicting claims of two utterly different women as he moves through the political minefields of a society designed to regulate his every move and stifle the promptings of his innermost heart.<br><br>For more than seventeen years, this devoted and ambitious doctor has been in love with an educated, clever, modern woman, Manna Wu. But back in the traditional world of his home village lives the wife his family chose for him when he was young--a humble and touchingly loyal woman, whom he visits in order to ask, again and again, for a divorce. In a culture in which the ancient ties of tradition and family still hold sway and where adultery discovered by the Party can ruin lives forever, Lin's passionate love is stretched ever more taut by the passing years. Every summer, his compliant wife agrees to a divorce but then backs out. This time, Lin promises, will be different.<br><br>Tracing these lives through their summer of decision and beyond, Ha Jin vividly conjures the texture of daily life in a place where the demands of human longing must contend with the weight of centuries of custom. Waiting charms and startles us&nbsp;&nbsp;with its depiction of a China that remains hidden to Western eyes even as it moves us with its piercing vision of the universal<br>complications of love.</p><p>"Every summer Lin Kong returned to Goose Village to divorce his wife, Shuyu." Like a fairy tale, Ha Jin's masterful novel of love and politics begins with a formula--and like a fairy tale, <i>Waiting</i> uses its slight, deceptively simple framework to encompass a wide range of truths about the human heart. Lin Kong is a Chinese army doctor trapped in an arranged marriage that embarrasses and repels him. (Shuyu has country ways, a withered face, and most humiliating of all, bound feet.) Nevertheless, he's content with his tidy military life, at least until he falls in love with Manna, a nurse at his hospital. Regulations forbid an army officer to divorce without his wife's consent--until 18 years have passed, that is, after which he is free to marry again. So, year after year Lin asks his wife for his freedom, and year after year he returns from the provincial courthouse: still married, still unable to consummate his relationship with Manna. Nothing feeds love like obstacles placed in its way--right? But Jin's novel answers the question of what might have happened to Romeo and Juliet had their romance been stretched out for several decades. In the initial confusion of his chaste love affair, Lin longs for the peace and quiet of his "old rut." Then killing time becomes its own kind of rut, and in the end, he is forced to conclude that he "waited eighteen years just for the sake of waiting." <p> There's a political allegory here, of course, but it grows naturally from these characters' hearts. Neither Lin nor Manna is especially ideological, and the tumultuous events occurring around them go mostly unnoticed. They meet during a forced military march, and have their first tender moment during an opera about a naval battle. (While the audience shouts, "Down with Japanese Imperialism!" the couple holds hands and gazes dreamily into each other's eyes.) When Lin is in Goose Village one summer, a mutual acquaintance rapes Manna; years later, the rapist appears on a TV report titled "To Get Rich Is Glorious," after having made thousands in construction. Jin resists hammering ideological ironies like these home, but totalitarianism's effects on Lin are clear: </p><blockquote> Let me tell you what really happened, the voice said. All those years you waited torpidly, like a sleepwalker, pulled and pushed about by others' opinions, by external pressure, by your illusions, by the official rules you internalized. You were misled by your own frustration and passivity, believing that what you were not allowed to have was what your heart was destined to embrace. </blockquote> Ha Jin himself served in the People's Liberation Army, and in fact left his native country for the U.S. only in 1985. That a non-native speaker can produce English of such translucence and power is truly remarkable--but really, his prose is the least of the miracles here. Improbably, Jin makes an unconsummated 18-year love affair loom as urgent as political terror or war, while history-changing events gain the immediacy of a domestic dilemma. Gracefully phrased, impeccably paced, <i>Waiting</i> is the kind of realist novel you thought was no longer being written. <i>--Mary Park</i>"Compassionate, earthy, robust, and wise, Waiting blends provocative allegory with all-too-human comedy. The result touches and reveals, bringing to life a singular world in its spectacular intricacy."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>-- Gish Jen, author of <b>Who's Irish?</b><br><br>"A remarkable love story. Ha Jin's understanding of the human heart and the human condition transcends borders and time. <b>Waiting</b> is an outstanding literary achievement." <br>-- Lisa See, author of <b>On Gold Mountain</b><br><br>"A deceptively simple tale, written with extraordinary precision and grace. Ha Jin has established himself as one of the great sturdy realists still writing in a postmodern age."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>-- <b>Kirkus Reviews</b></p><h2>Encyclopedia of Essential Oils: The complete guide to the use of aromatic oils in aromatherapy, herbalism, health and well-being</h2><p><p>This is one of the bestselling aromatherapy books of all time with vital information on plant origins, medical herbalism and the properties and actions of herbs and essential oils.

M. Stern's monumental series of documentary studies of New York City architecture and urbanism. The three previous books in the series, <i>New York 1900</i>, <i>New York 1930</i>, and <i>New York 1960</i>, have comprehensively covered the architects and urban planners who defined New York over the course of the twentieth century.<br><br> In this volume, Stern turns back to 1880 -- the end of the Civil War, the beginning of European modernism -- to trace the earlier history of the city. This dynamic era saw the technological advances and acts of civic and private will that formed the identity of New York City as we know it today. The installation of water, telephone, and electricity infrastructures as well as the advent of electric lighting, the elevator, and mass transit allowed the city to grow both out and up. The office building and apartment house types were envisioned and defined, changing the ways that New Yorkers worked and lived. Such massive public projects as the Brooklyn Bridge and Central Park became realities, along with such private efforts as Grand Central Station.<br><br> Like the other three volumes, <i>New York 1880</i> is an in-depth presentation of the buildings and plans that transformed New York from a harbor town into a world-class metropolis. A broad range of primary sources -- critics and writers, architects, planners, city officials -- brings the time period to life and allows the city to tell its own complex story. The book is generously illustrated with over 1,200 archival photographs, which show the city as it was, and as some parts of it still are.</p><p><b>Robert A. M. Stern</b>, principal partner of Robert A. M. Stern Architects, founded in 1969, is also dean of the Yale School of Architecture. In addition to the series on New York, which includes <i>New York 1900: Metropolitan Architecture and Urbanism, 1890-1915, New York 1930: Architecture and Urbanism Between the Two World Wars,</i> and <i>New York 1960: Architecture and Urbanism Between the Second World War and the Bicentennial,</i> Stern has published numerous books, including monographs on his firm's work, such as <i>Robert A. M. Stern: Houses</i> and <i>Robert A. M. Stern: Buildings and Projects, 1999 -- 2003</i>.<br><br> <b>Thomas Mellins</b> is an architectural historian and writer educated at Columbia University and the City University of New York. He is a coauthor of <i>New York 1930</i>, <i>New York 1960</i>, and a script collaborator on <i>Pride of Place</i>, the PBS documentary series on American architecture hosted by Stern. <br><br> <b>David Fishman</b>, a graduate of Columbia College, collaborated with Stern on <i>New York 1930</i>, <i>New York 1960</i>, <i>Pride of Place</i>, and the exhibition "42nd Street Theaters."Following New York 1900, New York 1930, and New York 1960, this is the fourth in a projected series of five volumes (New York 2000 is still to be written) chronicling the architecture and urbanism of New York City. Produced in the consistently comprehensive and extensively illustrated format, New York 1880 documents the years from 1865 to 1890, an era commonly known as the Gilded Age. At that time, New York City began growing up (thanks to Elisha Otis's hydraulic elevator) and out (as the first segment of the city's network of elevated trains was completed in 1878 and the Brooklyn Bridge opened in 1883). While this book is too prodigious for occasional readers, libraries that had success with previous volumes will want to add it to their collections.<br><i>-Jay Schafer, Bay Path Coll.

We may acknowledge the early Jamestown and Puritan colonists and mourn the dispossession of Native Americans, but we rarely grapple with the complexity of the nation&#x2019;s pre-revolutionary past. In this pathbreaking revision, Daniel Richter shows that the United States has a much deeper history than is apparent&#x2014;that far from beginning with a clean slate, it is a nation with multiple pasts that stretch back as far as the Middle Ages, pasts whose legacies continue to shape the present.</p><p><br></p><p><br>Exploring a vast range of original sources, <i>Before the Revolution</i> spans more than seven centuries and ranges across North America, Europe, and Africa. Richter recovers the lives of a stunning array of peoples&#x2014;Indians, Spaniards, French, Dutch, Africans, English&#x2014;as they struggled with one another and with their own people for control of land and resources. Their struggles occurred in a global context and built upon the remains of what came before. Gradually and unpredictably, distinctive patterns of North American culture took shape on a continent where no one yet imagined there would be nations called the United States, Canada, or Mexico.</p><p><br></p><p><br>By seeing these trajectories on their own dynamic terms, rather than merely as a prelude to independence, Richter&#x2019;s epic vision reveals the deepest origins of American history.</p></p><p>Daniel K. Richter is Roy F. and Jeannette P. Nichols Professor of American History and the Richard S. Dunn Director of the McNeil Center for Early American Studies at the University of Pennsylvania.Once every quarter-century or so, a book of great sweep and synthetic sophistication bursts onto the scene to recast our understanding of early American history. This masterful study, with its startling comparisons of European patterns of conquest, colonization, chaos, and cultural convergence, is a must-read. (Gary Nash, author of <i>The Liberty Bell<i>)<br><br>With breathtaking sweep and profound learning, Daniel K. Richter synthesizes the histories of Europe, North America, and the Atlantic world from the late Middle Ages to the late eighteenth century -- and he does it, in ways that no previous writer has managed, without carving his story into discontinuous regional narratives or succumbing to the teleology of the American Revolution. This book is nothing less than a masterpiece. (Fred Anderson, author of <i>The War That Made America</i>)<br><br>By placing early American history fully in its Atlantic contexts and seeing all participants as historical agents, <i>Before the Revolution</i> allows us to understand the genuine parallels as well as the contrasts in the experience of Americans through their layered pasts. (Karen O. Kupperman, author of <i>The Jamestown Project</i>)<br><br>An astute, thoroughly enjoyable mixture of political, economic and social history that culminates in a turbulent 18th-century North America whose people did not consider themselves on the verge of revolution but knew that things were not right. (<i>Kirkus Reviews (starred review)</i> 2011-03-15)<br><br>[Richter] demonstrates that U.S. history did not begin with the American Revolution, convincingly arguing that the ideas that manifested themselves in the mid-18th century with the rebellious colonists had their origins in such varied locales as the Mississippian Southeast and Europe of the Middle Ages...Any history written by this preeminent historian is an essential read for everyone interested in the deeper history of the United States. (John Burch <i>Library Journal</i> 2011-04-01)<br><br>So far it is one of my two or three favorite non-fiction titles of the year...Definitely recommended. (Tyler Cowen <i>marginalrevolution.com</i> 2011-04-07)<br><br>An elegantly written attempt to see colonial America from the indigenous perspective...In Richter's grand system, the continent's history comprises successive waves of adventurers, one atop another. Although the American Revolution "submerged these earlier strata," he argues that they nonetheless "remained beneath the surface to mold the nation's current contours." Walking atop the topmost strata, in other words, are thee and me, the terrain around us shaped by those who came first. The approach is bold, original and insightful...[A] masterly account...<i>Before the Revolution</i> is a book that by its very boldness invites intelligent argument. Every few decades, historians develop a new way of looking at the past. I am not talking about "revisionism" but unifying conceptual schemes, the sort of mental framework that Frederick Jackson Turner created in his argument for the importance of the frontier to our history or that Bernard Bailyn established in his studies of the American Revolution's ideological origins. Historians debated Turner for a long time and continue to debate Bailyn. I wouldn't be surprised if they were arguing with Richter a decade from today. (Charles C. Mann <i>Wall Street Journal</i> 2011-05-07)<br><br>Ultimately, [Richter's] history is a history of violence, of violence perpetrated by Europeans against Native Americans, by Native Americans against Europeans, and by both peoples against their own kith and kin. It is a dark and brutal story, although one in which the Native Americans are shown as for long holding their own, manipulating Europeans as trading partners and playing off one set of Europeans against another until the overwhelming British victory of 1763 no longer made this possible. There is precious little uplift here, and little sense of the more constructive characteristics of the brave new world that was rising amid the wreckage of the old. But, in patiently uncovering the layers beneath the rubble, Richter forcefully brings home to us that the American past belongs to many peoples, and that none should be forgotten. (J. H. Elliott <i>New York Review of Books</i> 2011-06-09)<br><br>The core of the work is a vivid, well-paced, stimulatingly opinionated and provocatively selective history of colonial Anglo-America...[A] spirited and engaging history of British North America...Richter's trenchant language excites enthusiasm. He evokes picturesque episodes engagingly--the agonies of Roanoke, the role of European goods in Powhatan power structures, the peripeties of indentured servants, the intolerance of Protestant fanatics, the poverty of seventeenth-century colonial home life, and the struggles of proprietors, rebels and crowns. (Felipe Fern�ndez-Armesto <i>Times Literary Supplement</i> 2011-09-23)<br><br>The most important history books make us rethink things we think we know. In <i>Before the Revolution: America's Ancient Pasts</i>, Daniel Richter shows us a land built by successive waves of adventurers, immigrants and merchants, one atop the other. He insists on the primacy of human action in history--something not always popular in academia today.

The most common reason for evictions in the US and a significant risk factor for fatal house fires, compulsive hoarding is a treatable condition related to obsessive-compulsive disorder. It is characterized by the acquisition of possessions that have little or no value, which the sufferer, often referred to as the saver, has great difficulty discarding.</p><p>This book, the first ever written for savers and their families, provides an overview of compulsive hoarding and how it relates to obsessive-compulsive disorder. It discusses hoarding broadly, offering readers perspectives on the physical, behavioral, and value-oriented aspects of the condition. You can use its assessment tools to help decide why you or your loved one hoards. Skill-building exercises help you determine how to beat the hoarding problem by addressing issues that often underlie compulsive saving. Even though this is fundamentally a self-help book, it contains a frank discussion about the need for professional help in some hoarding cases, how to find it, and what medications have been proven effective for savers.</p></p><p>Readers learn to: <p>� Differentiate between hoarding and collecting </p><p>� Recognize their type of hoarder </p><p>� Overcome the fear that causes one to hoard </p><p>� Stop the clutter from taking over </p><p>Three compulsive hoarding experts team up to provide the first research-based cognitive behavioral treatment plan to help compulsive hoarders learn to recognize the problem, understand the treatment options, and learn gentle techniques to free themselves of this life-threatening disorder.

A complete, easy-to-use, fun, travel guide to exploring St. John, Virgin Islands. It tells you exactly where to go, how to get there, and what to do and see when you arrive. It contains everything you need to know about the St. John&#39;s beaches and hiking trails, as well as its confusing system, of roads, foot-paths and goat-trails. Recommended by Caribbean Travel and Life and by many St. Johnians since locals are NOT on vacation and can&#39;t always take time off from work to be a tour guide for their guests. Best Selling St John Guidebook since 1994. Updated in 2013.</p><p>Pam Gaffin has lived on St John since 1989. She is an avid hiker and snorkeler. Not content with hiking the marked trails and swimming in all the bays, Pam is one of the few (only?) people that has both snorkeled and hiked the island's perimeter, along with all the ghutts on the island.<br><br>As an avid world explorer, Pam has used many guidebooks - some great, some terrible. She used that knowledge to write a book that is fun to read as well as informative. Much to her surprise, St John Feet Fins and Four Wheel Drive has been a best seller since 1994!Welcome to St. John <p>You've made it to the island - your long awaited vacation in the American Paradise is about to begin. You're standing on the ferry dock or sitting on your balcony admiring the view. Now what? </p><p>St. John is not large, not very developed, not very populous, and not very sophisticated. If your idea of a dream vacation features glitzy nightlife, tons of shopping, noisy casinos and lots of people - you are on the wrong island. </p><p>However, if you have arrived on St. John in search of natural beauty, friendly people, a vibrant community, and a pristine environment - then you are in exactly the right place. </p><p>Why? Because St. John is unique. It has a distinctly different history than St. Thomas, St. Croix or Tortola. There are subtle reasons for this - cultural, tribal, geographic, and agricultural reasons. St. Johnians have always taken pride in their well-deserved reputation for being fiercely independent, self-sufficient, and community-minded. What other tiny tropic island would refer to its only town as 'Love City?' </p><p>Another reason St. John is so unique is because of the National Park. Over half the island falls within its protective boundaries. No other island in the Caribbean has expended so much money, time, talent, careful thought, and hard labor to ward off the corrosive influence of modern man. </p><p>You say you want beaches? There are 39 of them - big ones, little ones, crowded ones, and lonely ones. There are beaches for sunbathing, beaches for beachcombing, and beaches for snorkeling. We've got sandy bays, rocky bays, mangrove bays and even salt ponds. There are beaches which are only two steps from your car, and beaches that you can only get to by hiking a long way. A few of our beaches have shops, snack bars and facilities - but most are splendidly undeveloped and natural. </p><p>No matter how idealized your expectations of the 'perfect tropical beach' may be - we've got a beach which will meet or exceed them. Guaranteed. </p><p>Hiking? St. John has ten minute and all day trails, easy trails and rather hard trails - and trails to historic ruins, isolated beaches, and salt ponds teeming with birds. There are over 20 miles of trails just in the park alone. </p><p>As for historic sites, there are ruins of five windmills on the island, old sugar cane factories, plantation Great Houses, mysterious petroglyphs, and even the landmarks of one of the most important slave insurrections in the world. </p><p>St. John roads snake alongside some of the most spectacular beaches in the world, and regularly offer breathtaking views of both the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. </p><p>Taxis are available to take you to some of the more popular beaches, but the best way to fully explore St. John is by rental jeep. </p><p>There are many curve-by-curve 'jeep tours' within this book, and one of them is just right for you, whether you're able to spend an active day or a leisurely month exploring the island. </p><p>We do, of course, have night life and shopping - and we certainly know how to party. Cruz Bay has a wide variety of shops, restaurants and bars but you don't need a guide book for that - just wander around town and enjoy. Wednesdays and Fridays are the biggest nights for live bands, but there's usually music somewhere on other nights. Special events, like a fish fry or benefit dance or baseball game or kite flying contest or historical lecture are advertised by posters all over town. </p><p>OK, now where are the beaches, the ruins, the protected forests and the trails? What should you do if you've only got one day? How can you get around the island? </p><p>That's what this book is for - to tell you what's out there, how to get to it, how to find it and how to enjoy it. </p><p>Welcome to St. John. Have fun exploring.</p></p><h2>The Making of the African Queen or How I Went to Africa with Bogart, Bacall and Huston and Almost Lost My Mind</h2><p>The renowned actress recalls her experience of making this popular film, revealing her emotional highs and lows during the filming, her competitiveness, and her insecurities</p><p>YA Young adults who have seen Katharine Hepburn in the film classic will enjoy her pungent recollection. Hepburn's characteristically elliptical, abrupt style enlivens memories of John Huston, Humphrey Bogart, and ``Bet ty'' Bacall as well as the calamities and joys of making a film in the African jun gle. The photosof the Queen plus launch-with-cameras, the camp of mud floors and thatched huts, the dressing room (a mirror propped against a tree)are profuse and captioned with more of the Hepburn dry wit and in sight.

Which is why, when her mother wakes one morning to find that Haley never came home the night before, and three months quickly pass without word from the girl, the community assumes the worst. <br><br> Wendy Tynes is a reporter on a mission, to identify and bring down sexual predators via elaborate&#x2014;and nationally televised&#x2014;sting operations. Working with local police on her news program Caught in the Act, Wendy and her team have publicly shamed dozens of men by the time she encounters her latest target. Dan Mercer is a social worker known as a friend to troubled teens, but his story soon becomes more complicated than Wendy could have imagined. <br><br> In a novel that challenges as much as it thrills, filled with the astonishing tension and unseen suburban machinations that have become Coben&#x2019;s trademark, <i>Caught</i> tells the story of a missing girl, the community stunned by her loss, the predator who may have taken her, and the reporter who suddenly realizes she can&#x2019;t trust her own instincts about this story&#x2014;or the motives of the people around her.<br><br> Praise for <i>Long Lost</i>: <br><br> "Coben is one of the best authors around at writing page-turning suspense, as <i>Long Lost</i> makes clear." <br> -<i>Chicago Sun-Times</i> <br><br> "Roller-coaster plot and savvy dialogue...All the ingredients of a good old- fashioned thriller: murder, action and wit." <br> -<i>New York Daily News</i></p><p><b>Harlan Coben</b> is the bestselling author of sixteen previous novels, including the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers <i>Long Lost</i> and <i>Hold Tight</i>. Winner of the Edgar Award, the Shamus Award, and the Anthony Award, Coben lives in New Jersey with his family.<b>Prologue</b><p>I knew opening that red door would destroy my life.</p><p>Yes, that sounds melodramatic and full of foreboding and I&#x2019;m not big on either, and true, there was nothing menacing about the red door. In fact, the door was beyond ordinary, wood and four-paneled, the kind of door you see standing guard in front of three out of every four suburban homes, with faded paint and a knocker at chest level no one ever used and a faux brass knob. </p> <p>But as I walked toward it, a distant streetlight barely illuminating my way, the dark opening yawning like a mouth ready to gobble me whole, the feeling of doom was unshakeable. Each step forward took great effort as if I were walking not along a somewhat crackled walk but through still-wet cement. My body displayed all the classic symptoms of impending menace: Chill down my spine? Check. Hairs standing up on my arms? Yep. Prickle at the base of the neck? Present. Tingle in the scalp? Right there.</p><p>The house was dark, not a single light on. Chynna warned me that would be the case. The dwelling somehow seemed a little too cookie-cutter, a little too nondescript. That bothered me for some reason. This house was also isolated at the tippy end of the cul-de-sac, hunkering down in the darkness as though fending off intruders. </p><p>I didn&#x2019;t like it. </p><p>I didn&#x2019;t like anything about this, but this is what I do. When Chynna called I had just finished coaching the inner-city fourth-grade Newark Biddy Basketball team. My team, all kids who, like me, were products of foster care (we call ourselves the NoRents, which is short for No Parents&#x2014;gallows humor), had managed to blow a six-point lead with two minutes left. On the court as in life, the NoRents aren&#x2019;t great under pressure.</p><p>Chynna called as I was gathering my young hoopsters for my postgame pep talk, which usually consisted of giving my charges some life-altering insight like &#x201c;Good effort,&#x201d; &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll get them next time,&#x201d; or &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t forget we have a game next Thursday,&#x201d; always ending with &#x201c;Hands in&#x201d; and then we yell, &#x201c;Defense,&#x201d; choosing to chant that word, I suppose, because we play none. </p><p>&#x201c;Dan?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who is this?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Chynna. Please come.&#x201d;</p><p>Her voice trembled, so I dismissed my team, jumped in my car, and now I was here. I hadn&#x2019;t even had time to shower. The smell of gym sweat mixed now with the smell of fear sweat. I slowed my pace.</p><p>What was wrong with me?</p><p>I probably should have showered, for one thing. I&#x2019;m not good without a shower. Never have been. But Chynna had been adamant. Now, she had begged. Before anyone got home. So here I was, my gray T-shirt darkened with perspiration and clinging to my chest, heading to that door. </p><p>Like most youngsters I work with, Chynna was seriously troubled, and maybe that was what was setting off the warning bells. I hadn&#x2019;t liked her voice on the phone, hadn&#x2019;t really warmed to this whole setup. Taking a deep breath, I glanced behind me. In the distance, I could see some signs of life on this suburban night&#x2014;house lights, a flickering television or maybe computer monitor, an open garage door&#x2014;but in this cul-de-sac, there was nothing, not a sound or movement, just a hush in the dark.</p><p>My cell phone vibrated, nearly making me jump out of my skin. I figured that it was Chynna, but no, it was Jenna, my ex-wife. I hit answer and said, &#x201c;Hey.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can I ask a favor?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a little busy right now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I just need someone to babysit tomorrow night. You can bring Shelly if you want.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Shelly and I are, uh, having trouble,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Again? But she&#x2019;s great for you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I have trouble holding on to great women.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t I know it.&#x201d;</p><p>Jenna, my lovely ex, has been remarried for eight years. Her new husband is a well-respected surgeon named Noel Wheeler. Noel does volunteer work for me at the teen center. I like Noel and he likes me. He has a daughter by a previous marriage, and he and Jenna have a six-year-old girl named Kari. I&#x2019;m Kari&#x2019;s godfather, and both kids call me Uncle Dan. I&#x2019;m the family go-to babysitter. </p><p>I know this all sounds very civilized and Pollyanna, and I suppose it is. In my case, it could be simply a matter of necessity. I have no one else&#x2014;no parents, no siblings&#x2014;ergo, the closest thing I have to family is my ex-wife. The kids I work with, the ones I advocate for and try to help and defend, are my life, and in the end I&#x2019;m not sure I do the slightest bit of good. </p><p>Jenna said, &#x201c;Earth to Dan?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be there,&#x201d; I said to her.</p><p>&#x201c;Six thirty. You&#x2019;re the best.&#x201d;</p><p>Jenna made a smooching noise into the mouthpiece and hung up. I looked at the phone for a moment, remembered our own wedding day. It was a mistake for me to get married. It is a mistake for me to get too close to people, and yet I can&#x2019;t help it. Someone cue the violins so I can wax philosophical about how it is better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all. I don&#x2019;t think that applies to me. It is in humans&#x2019; DNA to repeat the same mistakes, even after we know better. So here I am, the poor orphan who scraped his way up to the top of his class at an elite Ivy League school but never really scraped off who he was. Corny, but I want someone in my life. Alas, that is not destiny. I am a loner who isn&#x2019;t meant to be alone.</p><p><i>&#x201c;We are evolution&#x2019;s refuse, Dan. . . .&#x201d;</i></p><p>My favorite foster &#x201c;dad&#x201d; taught me that. He was a college professor who loved to get into philosophical debates. </p><p><i>&#x201c;Think about it, Dan. Throughout mankind, the strongest and brightest did what? They fought in wars. That only stopped this past century. Before that, we sent our absolute best to fight on the front lines. So who stayed home and reproduced while our finest died on distant battlefields? The lame, the sick, the weak, the crooked, the cowardly&#x2014;in short, the least of us. That&#x2019;s what we are the genetic byproduct of, Dan&#x2014;millenniums of weeding out the premium and keeping the flotsam. That&#x2019;s why we are all garbage&#x2014;the worst leftovers from centuries of bad breeding.&#x201d;</i></p><p>I forgo the knocker and rapped on the door lightly with my knuckles. The door creaked open a crack. I hadn&#x2019;t realized that it was ajar. </p> <p>I didn&#x2019;t like that either. A lot I didn&#x2019;t like here.</p><p>As a kid, I watched a lot of horror movies, which was strange because I hated them. I hated things jumping out at me. And I really couldn&#x2019;t stand movie gore. But I would still watch them and revel in the predictably moronic behavior of the heroines, and right now those scenes were replaying in my head, the ones where said moronic heroine knocks on a door and it opens a little and you scream, &#x201c;Run, you scantily clad bimbo!&#x201d; and she wouldn&#x2019;t and you couldn&#x2019;t understand it and two minutes later, the killer would be scooping out her skull and munching on her brain.</p><p>I should go right now. </p> <p>In fact, I will. But then I flashed back to Chynna&#x2019;s call, to the words she&#x2019;d said, the trembling in her voice. I sighed, leaned my face toward the opening, peered into the foyer.</p><p>Darkness.</p><p>Enough with the cloak and dagger.</p><p>&#x201c;Chynna?&#x201d;</p><p>My voice echoed. I expected silence. That would be the next step, right? No reply. I slip the door open a little, take a tentative step forward . . .</p><p>&#x201c;Dan? I&#x2019;m in the back. Come in.&#x201d;</p><p>The voice was muffled, distant. Again I didn&#x2019;t like this, but there was no way I was backing out now. Backing out had cost me too much throughout my life. My hesitation was gone. I knew what had to be done now. </p> <p>I opened the door, stepped inside, and closed the door behind me. </p> <p>Others in my position would have brought a gun or some kind of weapon. I had thought about it. But that just doesn&#x2019;t work for me. No time to worry about that now. No one was home. Chynna had told me that. And if they were, well, I would handle that when the moment came.</p><p>&#x201c;Chynna?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Go to the den, I&#x2019;ll be there in a second.&#x201d;</p><p>The voice sounded . . . off. I saw a light at the end of the hall and moved toward it. There was a noise now. I stopped and listened. Sounded like water running. A shower maybe.</p><p>&#x201c;Chynna?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just changing. Out in a second.&#x201d;</p><p>I moved into the low-lit den. I saw one of those dimmer switch knobs and debated turning it up, but in the end I chose to leave it alone. My eyes adjusted pretty quickly. The room had cheesy wood paneling that looked as if it was made from something far closer to vinyl than anything in the timber family. There were two portraits of sad clowns with huge flowers on their lapels, the kind of painting you might pick up at a particularly tacky motel&#x2019;s garage sale. There was a giant open bottle of no-name vodka on the bar.</p><p>I thought I heard somebody whisper.</p><p>&#x201c;Chynna?&#x201d; I called out.</p><p>No answer. I stood, listened for more whispering. Nothing.</p><p>I started toward the back, toward where I heard the shower running. </p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be right out,&#x201d; I heard the voice say. I pulled up, felt a chill. Because now I was closer to the voice. I could hear it better. And here was the thing I found particularly strange about it:</p><p>It didn&#x2019;t sound at all like Chynna.</p><p>Three things tugged at me. One, panic. This wasn&#x2019;t Chynna. Get out of the house. Two, curiosity. If it wasn&#x2019;t Chynna, who the hell was it and what was going on? Three, panic again. It had been Chynna on the phone&#x2014;so what had happened to her?</p><p>I couldn&#x2019;t just run out now.</p><p>I took one step toward where I&#x2019;d come in, and that was when it all happened. </p> <p>A spotlight snapped on in my face, blinding me. I stumbled back, hand coming up to my face. </p> <p>&#x201c;Dan Mercer?&#x201d;</p><p>I blinked. Female voice. Professional. Deep tone. Sounded oddly familiar.</p><p>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s there?&#x201d; </p> <p>Suddenly there were other people in the room. A man with a camera. Another with what looked liked a boom mike. And the female with the familiar voice, a stunning woman with chestnut brown hair and a business suit.</p><p>&#x201c;Wendy Tynes, <i>Eyewitness News</i>. Why are you here, Dan?&#x201d;</p><p>I opened my mouth, nothing came out. I recognized the woman from that TV newsmagazine . . .</p><p>&#x201c;Why have you been conversing online in a sexual manner with a thirteen year-old girl, Dan? We have your communications with her.&#x201d;</p><p>. . . the one that sets up and catches pedophiles on camera for all the world to see.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you here to have sex with a twelve-year-old girl?&#x201d;</p><p>The truth of what was going on here hits me, freezing my bones. Other people flooded the room. Producers maybe. Another cameraman. Two cops. The cameras come in closer. The lights get brighter. Beads of sweat pop up on my brow. I start to stammer, start to deny. </p><p>But it&#x2019;s over. </p><p>Two days later, the show airs. The world sees. </p><p>And the life of Dan Mercer, just as I somehow knew when I approached that door, is destroyed.</p> <p> ***</p><p>When Marcia McWaid first saw her daughter&#x2019;s empty bed, panic did not set in. That would come later.</p><p>She had woken up at six am, early for Saturday morning, feeling pretty terrific. Ted, her husband of twenty years, slept in the bed next to her. He lay on his stomach, his arm around her waist. Ted liked to sleep with a shirt on and no pants. None. Nude from the waist down. &#x201c;Gives my man down there room to roam,&#x201d; he would say with a smirk. And Marcia, imitating her daughters&#x2019; teenage singsong tone, would say, &#x201c;T-M-I&#x201d;&#x2014;Too Much Information. </p> <p>Marcia slipped out of his grip and padded down to the kitchen. She made herself a cup of coffee with the new Keurig pod machine. Ted loved gadgets&#x2014;boys and their toys&#x2014;but this one actually got some use. You take the pod, you stick it in the machine&#x2014;presto, coffee. No video screens, no touch pad, no wireless connectivity. Marcia loved it.</p><p>They&#x2019;d recently finished an addition on the house&#x2014;one extra bedroom, one bathroom, the kitchen knocked out a bit with a glassed-in nook. The kitchen nook offered oodles of morning sun and had thus become Marcia&#x2019;s favorite spot in the house. She took her coffee and the newspaper and set herself on the window seat folding her feet beneath her. </p> <p>A small slice of heaven.</p><p>She let herself read the paper and sip her coffee. In a few minutes she would have to check the schedule. Ryan, her third grader, had the early Hoops Basketball game at eight am. Ted coached. His team was winless for the second straight season.</p><p>&#x201c;Why do your teams never win?&#x201d; Marcia had asked him.</p><p>&#x201c;I draft the kids based on two criteria.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That being?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How nice the father&#x2014;and how hot the mom.&#x201d;</p><p>She had slapped at him playfully and maybe Marcia would have been somewhat concerned if she hadn&#x2019;t seen the moms on the sideline and knew, for certain, that he had to be joking. Ted was actually a great coach, not in terms of strategy but in terms of handling the boys. They all loved him and his lack of competiveness so that even the untalented players, the ones who were usually discouraged and quit during the season, showed up every week. Ted even took the Bon Jovi song and turned it around, &#x201c;You give losing a good name.&#x201d; The kids would laugh and cheer every basket and when you&#x2019;re in third grade that&#x2019;s how it should be.</p><p>Marcia&#x2019;s fourteen-year-old daughter, Patricia, had rehearsal for the freshman play, an abridged version of the musical <i>Les Miserables</i>. She had several small parts, but that didn&#x2019;t seem to affect the workload. And her oldest child, Haley, the high school senior, was running a &#x201c;captain&#x2019;s practice&#x201d; for the girls&#x2019; lacrosse team. Captain&#x2019;s practices were unofficial, a way to sneak in early practices under the guidelines issued by high school sports. In short, no coaches, nothing official, just a casual gathering, glorified pickup games if you will, run by the captains. </p><p>Like most suburban parents, Marcia had a love-hate relationship with sports. She knew the relative long-term irrelevancy and yet still managed to get caught up in it.</p><p>A half hour of peace to start the day. That was all she needed.</p><p>She finished the first cup, pod-made herself a second, picked up the &#x201c;Styles&#x201d; section of the paper. The house remained silent. She padded upstairs and looked over her charges. Ryan slept on his side, his face conveniently facing the door so that his mother could notice the echo of his father. </p> <p>Patricia&#x2019;s room was next. She too was still sleeping. </p><p>&#x201c;Honey?&#x201d;</p><p>Patricia stirred, might have made a noise. Her room, like Ryan&#x2019;s, looked as if someone had strategically placed sticks of dynamite in the drawers, blowing them open; some clothes sprawled dead on the floor, others lay wounded midway, clinging to the armoire like the fallen on a barricade before the French Revolution.</p><p>&#x201c;Patricia? You have rehearsal in an hour.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m up,&#x201d; she groaned in a voice that indicated she was anything but. Marcia moved to the next room, Haley&#x2019;s, and took a quick peek.</p><p>The bed was empty. </p> <p>It was also made, but that was no surprise. Unlike her siblings&#x2019; abodes, this one was neat, clean, anally organized. It could be a showroom in a furniture store. There were no clothes on this floor, every drawer fully closed. The trophies&#x2014;and there were many&#x2014;were perfectly aligned on four shelves. Ted had put in the fourth shelf just recently, after Haley&#x2019;s team had won the holiday tournament in Franklin Lakes. Haley had painstakingly divided up the trophies among ...</p></p><h2>Memory of Fire V 2: Faces &amp; Masks (Memory of Fire Trilogy)</h2><p>The second volume of Galeano&#39;s dazzling New World trilogy continues his recreation of the experience of Latin America from 1700 to the 20th century.</p><p>olume of Galeano&#39;s dazzling New World trilogy continues his recreation of the experience of Latin America from 1700 to the 20th century.<b>Eduardo Galeano</b>&#x2018;s works, which have been translated into twenty-eight languages, include <i>Memory of Fire</i> (three volumes); <i>Open Veins of Latin America</i>; <i>Soccer in Sun and Shadow</i>; <i>Days and Nights of Love and War</i>; <i>The Books of Embraces</i>; <i>Upside Down</i>; and <i>Mirrors</i>.

A believer and an unbeliever, a socialist and a snob, an unhappy husband and a desolate widower, Hardy challenged the sexual and religious conventions of his time in his novels and then abandoned fiction to reestablish himself as a great twentieth-century lyric poet. In this acclaimed new biography, Claire Tomalin, one of today's preeminent literary biographers, investigates this beloved writer and reveals a figure as rich and complex as his tremendous legacy.</p><p>Claire Tomalin is the author of <i>Samuel Pepys: The Unequalled Self</i>, winner of the Whitbread Book of the Year, the Whitbread Biography Award, the Samuel Pepys Award, and dubbed "invaluable" by <i>The New York Review of Books</i>. She is a trustee of the National Portrait Gallery, London, and the Wordsworth Trust, a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, and a Vice President of English PEN. She lives her husband, the playwright and novelist Michael FraynReviewed by Jonathan Yardley<p>In the summer of 1926, Thomas Hardy was visited at his house in Dorset by Leonard and Virginia Woolf, she being "the daughter of his old editor Leslie Stephen." Hardy, Claire Tomalin reports in this new biography, had read nothing of hers, although she had published several novels, most recently Mrs. Dalloway. Neither of the Woolfs was offended by this. Instead, both came away charmed by "his freedom, ease and vitality," Virginia wrote in her diary, and a year and a half later, not long after Hardy's death, Leonard published a tribute to him and his work, which he summarized as "in the full English tradition, solid works built about a story, in which, on the face of it, character, humour, description of scenery, criticism of life, philosophy, all have their place, but to which they are accessory," a body of work that added up to "a great novel and a great work of art." As to the man himself: </p><p>"This impression of simplicity and of something which is almost the opposite of simplicity was the strongest impression which I got from Hardy personally. At first sight, and when he began to talk to you, you might have thought that he was merely one of many men born in English villages. But he is one of the few people who have left upon me the personal impression of greatness. I saw him . . . in the house which he had built for himself at Dorchester, and which, with its sombre growth of trees, seemed to have been created by him as if it were one of his poems translated into brick, furniture and vegetation. He talked about his poems, and London as he had known it in his youth, and about his dog 'Wessex', all with great charm and extraordinary simplicity. He was a human being, not 'the great man.' "</p><p>It is one of the many strengths of Claire Tomalin's biography that she conveys in full Hardy's simple humanity. Obviously he was not a simple man as the term is ordinarily used -- indeed, the days of his long life were filled with complexity -- but he retained to the end an almost childlike fascination with and love for the quotidian world, which no doubt goes a long way toward explaining why, eight decades after his death, his work remains beloved and widely read. His novels and poems fall in and out of literary fashion, but they never fall out of print. He was not an unduly graceful prose stylist, and he tended to throw more into a novel than it could sustain, but, as Tomalin writes, his work is "full of curious and arresting perceptions, sublime moments, wilful and tragic men and women who impose themselves by their originality and their vivid human presence." </p><p>Hardy's life story has been written many times -- by Michael Millgate and Ralph Pite most recently -- and Hardy himself wrote a two-volume autobiography in collaboration with his second wife, Florence, which was published after his death. Tomalin brings to the task the skills of an experienced and accomplished biographer -- among her previous subjects are Mary Wollstonecraft, Jane Austen and Samuel Pepys -- and the confidence of a deeply informed literary critic. Her prose is fluid, and she can see her subject's strengths and weaknesses clearly but sympathetically. </p><p>Whenever a biographer decides to take on a person whose life has been written many times, invariably and perhaps inevitably an attempt is made to separate oneself from the crowd. Tomalin's attempt to do this -- so at least I interpret it -- is to emphasize Hardy's poetry. She begins with the death of his first wife, Emma, in 1912. She had been ill for some time, and the life had gone out of their marriage years before, but Tomalin argues that her death was "the moment when Thomas Hardy became a great poet." He was "filled with sorrow and remorse for their estrangement" and "began at once to revisit their early love in his mind with an intensity that expressed itself in a series of poems." Tomalin writes: </p><p>"In these poems about Emma he is rediscovering repressed sorrow and forgotten love. He is like an archaeologist uncovering objects that have not been seen for many decades, bringing them out into the light, examining them, some small pieces, some curious bones and broken bits, and some shining treasures. There is a rising excitement in the writing as of someone making discoveries. He has found the most perfect subject he has ever had, and he has the skills to work on it." </p><p>This is a biographical judgment that rings true but a literary judgment with which I must respectfully take issue. To me, Hardy's "most perfect subject" was Wessex, the fictionalized Dorset that is the setting for virtually all of his fiction, most notably his five greatest novels, Far From the Madding Crowd, The Return of the Native, The Mayor of Casterbridge, Tess of the D'Urbervilles and Jude the Obscure. Hardy's poetry, though full of lovely moments, has never resonated with me the way these novels do, so the weight Tomalin accords it strikes me as excessive. </p><p>But this is a literary judgment. Though there are objective ways to measure literary accomplishment, they fall far short of the scientific and ultimately are subjective. What matters most about Tomalin's biography is the care with which she traces all of Hardy's writing to its roots in his own life. Her study reminds us that though a knowledge of a writer's life is unnecessary to an appreciation of his or her work, that knowledge can help us understand that work and its sources. </p><p>Hardy was born in Dorset in 1840 to a husband and wife of modest means. His father was a builder, kind and patient with a frail boy; his mother was "strong-minded and intelligent" and encouraged him to rise above his class at a time when class lines in England were rigidly drawn and almost impossible to cross. As a youth, he was deeply stung in church (a place he disliked) when the minister denounced people who were ambitious to rise in station, and this resentment stayed with him long after he had done precisely that. It is a persistent theme in his writing, the novels especially; other important themes include the ways of life of ordinary people, the injustices to which they regularly are subjected, the natural beauty with which they are surrounded, the country roads along which they walk: "The road became a theatre for action in his imagination and walking a central activity in his writing, used dramatically and to establish or underline character." By the 1870s, with the!</p><p> publication of The Return of the Native, he brought all this together. Henry James called the novel "second rate," but he was wrong: </p><p>"He was wrong because Hardy had found a true voice, sometimes awkward but tuned into experiences and feelings outside the range of Henry James. It is a voice that speaks to readers in many countries and to which successive generations have responded. With this voice Hardy established the territory in which he worked best in fiction, in which rural landscape is drawn with a naturalist's eye and country people are shown playing out their lives 'between custom and education, between work and ideas, between love of place and experience of change'. From now on all his best novels . . . were built on this foundation." </p><p>Those novels made him rich beyond anything he could have imagined and famous around the world. Though he never entered the aristocracy, he was on close terms with many members of it, who scurried to be in his company as the aura of his �clat grew ever brighter and wider. He was well aware, though, of how quickly and cruelly the upper classes could strike against their ostensible inferiors. In 1870, when he began courting Emma Gifford, her parents rejected him out of hand and refused to be present when they finally married four years later. In its early years, the marriage was reasonably happy, but husband and wife gradually drew apart; she enjoyed the fruits of his wealth and fame but thought she should get greater credit for her contributions to his work than she was given (or deserved), and he was so preoccupied with his work that he was frequently inattentive and distant. By the time of her death, he was in love with the much younger Florence Dugdale, though, as Toma!</p><p> lin says, he felt the loss of Emma deeply, which Florence (understandably) came to resent. </p><p>What Hardy lived for was his work. "From very early he began to make life into art, by seeing the special quality of natural occurrences and by dramatizing and embellishing them," but though he clearly had a calling to write he also went about it with supreme professionalism. He usually published serially and "suffered from bowdlerizing editors throughout his writing career," but he "understood the business side of writing, the importance of serialization, and how to deal with the American market, and the Australian, as well as British publishers and magazine editors." </p><p>He was not too proud to write for the market and accede to its demands, though when he prepared serials for book publication he put back material editors had removed and edited to suit his own standards rather than theirs. Among the many useful things his life and work tell us is that professionalism is not the enemy of art, but its agent and handmaiden.</p><p>Copyright 2007, The Washington Post.

My sister, Constance, had married the fall before and moved to Graniteville.<br><br>I was up exploring in the woods, near the Devil&#x2019;s Hand, where Papa had forbidden us to play. The trees were leafing out, making a lush green canopy overhead. The sun had warmed the soil, giving the damp woods a rich, loamy smell. Here and there beneath the beech, sugar maple, and birch trees were spring flowers: trilliums, trout lilies, and my favorite, jack-in-the-pulpit, a funny little flower with a secret: if you lift the striped hood, you&#x2019;ll find the preacher underneath. Auntie had shown me this, and taught me that you could dig up the tubers and cook them like turnips. I had just found one and was pulling back the hood, looking for the tiny figure underneath, when I heard footsteps, slow and steady, moving my way. Heavy feet dragging through the dry leaves, stumbling on roots. I wanted to run, but froze with panic, having squatted down low behind a rock just as a figure moved into the clearing.<br><br>I recognized her at once--Hester Jameson.<br><br>She&#x2019;d died two weeks before from typhoid fever. I had attended her funeral with Papa and Jacob, seen her laid to rest in the cemetery behind the church up by Cranberry Meadow. Everyone from school was there, all in Sunday best.<br><br>Hester&#x2019;s father, Erwin, ran Jameson&#x2019;s Tack and Feed Shop. He wore a black coat with frayed sleeves, and his nose was red and running. Beside him stood his wife, Cora Jameson, a heavyset woman who had a seamstress shop in town. Mrs. Jameson sobbed into a lace handkerchief, her whole body heaving and trembling.<br><br>I had been to funerals before, but never for someone my own age. Usually it was the very old or the very young. I couldn&#x2019;t take my eyes off the casket, just the right size for a girl like me. I stared at the plain wooden box until I grew dizzy, wondering what it might feel like to be laid out inside. Papa must have noticed, because he took my hand and gave it a squeeze, pulled me a little closer to him.<br><br>Reverend Ayers, a young man then, said Hester was with the angels. Our old preacher, Reverend Phelps, was stooped over, half deaf, and none of what he said made any sense--it was all frightening metaphors about sin and salvation. But when Reverend Ayers with his sparkling blue eyes spoke, it felt as if he said each word right to me.<br><br>&#x201c;I am he who will sustain you. I have made you and I will carry you; I will sustain you and I will rescue you.&#x201d;<br><br>For the first time, I understood the word of God, because Reverend Ayers spoke it. His voice, all the girls said, could soothe the Devil himself.<br><br>A red-winged blackbird cried out conk-a-reee from a nearby hazel bush. He puffed up his red shoulders and sang over and over, as loud as he could, his call almost hypnotic; even Reverend Ayers paused to look.<br><br>Mrs. Jameson dropped to her knees, keening. Mr. Jameson tried to pull her up, but did not have the strength.<br><br>I stood right beside Papa, clutching his hand, as dirt was shoveled down on the coffin of poor Hester Jameson. Hester had a crooked front tooth, but a beautifully delicate face. She had been the best in our class at arithmetic. Once, for my birthday, she gave me a note with a flower pressed inside. A violet it was, dried out and perfectly preserved. May your day be as special as you are, she&#x2019;d written in perfect cursive. I tucked it into my Bible, where it stayed for years, until it either disintegrated or fell out, I cannot recall.<br><br>Now, two weeks after her very own funeral, Hester&#x2019;s sleeper caught sight of me there in the woods, crouching behind the rock. I shall never forget the look in her eyes--the frightened half-recognition of someone waking from a horrible dream.<br><br>I had heard about sleepers; there was even a game we played in the schoolyard in which one child would be laid out dead in a circle of violets and forget-me-nots. Then someone would lean down and whisper magic words in the dead girl&#x2019;s ear, and she would rise and chase all the other children. The first one she caught would be the next to die.<br><br>I think I may have even played this game once with Hester Jameson.<br><br>I had heard whispers, rumors of sleepers called back from the land of the dead by grieving husbands and wives, but was certain they only existed in the stories old women liked to tell each other while they folded laundry or stitched stockings--something to pass the time, and to make any eavesdropping children hurry home before dark.<br><br>I had been sure, up until then, that God in his infinite wisdom would not have allowed such an abomination.<br><br>Hester and I were not ten feet apart. Her blue dress was filthy and torn, her corn-silk hair in tangles. She gave off the musty smell of damp earth, but there was something else behind it, an acrid, greasy, burnt odor, similar to what you smell when you blow out a tallow candle.<br><br>Our eyes met, and I yearned to speak, to say her name, but could only manage a strangled-sounding Hss.<br><br>Hester ran off into the woods like a startled rabbit. I stayed frozen, clinging pathetically to my rock like a bit of lichen.<br><br>From down the path leading to the Devil&#x2019;s Hand came another figure, running, calling Hester&#x2019;s name.<br><br>It was her mother, Cora Jameson.<br><br>She stopped when she saw me, face flushed and frantic. She was breathing hard and had scratches on her face and arms, pieces of dry leaves and twigs tangled in her hair.<br><br>&#x201c;Tell no one,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;But why?&#x201d; I asked, stepping out from behind the rock.<br><br>She looked right at me--through me, almost, as if I were a pane of dirty window glass. &#x201c;Someday, Sara,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;maybe you&#x2019;ll love someone enough to understand.&#x201d;<br><br>Then she ran off into the woods, following her daughter.<br><br>I told Auntie about it later.<br><br>&#x201c;Is it really possible?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;To bring someone back like that?&#x201d;<br><br>We were down by the river, picking fiddleheads, filling Auntie&#x2019;s basket with the curled fern tops, as we did each spring. Then we&#x2019;d bring them home and make a creamy soup stuffed full of wild greens and herbs that Auntie had gathered along the way. We were also there to check the traps--Auntie had caught a beaver just two days before and was hoping for another. Beaver pelts were a rarity and brought a high price. They were once nearly as common as squirrels&#x2019;, Auntie said, but trappers had taken all except a handful.<br><br>Buckshot was with us, nosing the ground, ears attentive to every little sound. I never knew if he was all wolf, or only part. Auntie had found him as a pup, when he&#x2019;d fallen into one of her pit traps after being all shot up by someone. She&#x2019;d carried him home, pulled the buckshot pellets out of him, stitched him up, and nursed him back to health. He&#x2019;d been by her side ever since.<br><br>&#x201c;He was lucky you found him,&#x201d; I said after hearing the story.<br><br>&#x201c;Luck had nothing to do with it,&#x201d; Auntie told me. &#x201c;He and I were meant for one another.&#x201d;<br><br>I never saw such devotion in a dog--or any animal, for that matter. His wounds had healed, but the buckshot left him blind in his right eye, which was milky white. His ghost eye, Auntie called it.<br><br>&#x201c;He came so close to death, he&#x2019;s got one eye back there still,&#x201d; she explained. I loved Buckshot, but I hated that milky-white moon that seemed to see everything and nothing all at once.<br><br>Auntie was not related to me by blood, but she cared for me, raised me after my own mother died giving birth to me. I had no memory of my mother--the only proofs of her existence were my parents&#x2019; wedding photograph, the quilt she&#x2019;d sewn that I slept under every night, and the stories my older brother and sister told.<br><br>My brother claimed I had my mother&#x2019;s laugh. My sister said that my mother had been the best dancer in the county, that she was the envy of all the other girls.<br><br>Auntie&#x2019;s people came from up north, in Quebec. Her father had been a trapper; her mother, an Indian woman. Auntie carried a hunting knife, and wore a long deerskin coat decorated with bright beads and porcupine quills. She spoke French, and sang songs in a language I never did recognize. She wore a ring carved from yellowed bone on her right pointer finger.<br><br>&#x201c;What does it say?&#x201d; I asked once, touching the strange letters and symbols on its surface.<br><br>&#x201c;That life is a circle,&#x201d; she answered.<br><br>People in town were frightened of Auntie, but their fear did not keep them away from her door. They followed the well-worn path to her cabin in the woods out behind the Devil&#x2019;s Hand, carrying coins, honey, whiskey--whatever they had to trade for her remedies. Auntie had drops for colic, tea for fever, even a little blue bottle that she swore contained a potion so powerful that with one drop the object of your heart&#x2019;s desire would be yours. I knew better than to doubt her.<br><br>There were other things I knew about Auntie, too. I&#x2019;d seen her sneak out of Papa&#x2019;s bedroom in the early morning, heard the sounds that came from behind his locked door when she visited him there.<br><br>I also knew better than to cross her. She had a fiery temper and little patience with people who did not see things her way. If people refused to pay her for her services, she&#x2019;d call on them, sprinkle their homes with black powder pulled from one of her leather pouches, and speak a strange incantation. Terrible things would befall those families from then on: sicknesses, fires, crop losses, even death.<br><br>I tossed a handful of dark-green fiddleheads into the basket.<br><br>&#x201c;Tell me, Auntie, please,&#x201d; I begged, &#x201c;can the dead come back?&#x201d;<br><br>Auntie looked at me a long time, head cocked to the side, her small, dark eyes fixed on mine.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she told me at last. &#x201c;There is a way. Few know of it, but those who do, pass it down to their children. Because you are the closest I will ever come to a child of my own, the secret will go to you. I will write it all down, everything I know about sleepers. I will fold up the papers, put them in an envelope, and seal it with wax. You will hide it away, and one day, when you are ready, you will open it up.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How will I know I am ready?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>She smiled, showing her small teeth, pointed like a fox&#x2019;s and stained brown from tobacco. &#x201c;You will know.&#x201d;<br><br>I am writing these words in secret, hidden under covers. Martin and Lucius believe I am sleeping. I hear them downstairs, drinking coffee and discussing my prognosis. (Not good, I&#x2019;m afraid.)<br><br>I have been going back in my mind, thinking over how all of this began, piecing things together the way one might sew a quilt. But, oh, what a hideous and twisted quilt mine would be!<br><br>&#x201c;Gertie,&#x201d; I hear Martin say above the clink of a spoon stirring coffee in his favorite tin mug. I imagine the furrow of his brow, the deep worry lines there; how sad his face must be after he spoke her name.<br><br>I hold my breath and listen hard.<br><br>&#x201c;Sometimes a tragedy breaks a person,&#x201d; Lucius says. &#x201c;Sometimes they will never be whole again.&#x201d;<br><br>If I close my eyes even now, I can still see my Gertie&#x2019;s face, feel her sugary breath on my cheek. I can so vividly recall our last morning together, hear her saying, &#x201c;If snow melts down to water, does it still remember being snow?&#x201d;<br>Martin<br><br>January 12, 1908<br><br>&#x201c;Wake up, Martin.&#x201d; A soft whisper, a flutter against his cheek. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s time.&#x201d;<br><br>Martin opened his eyes, leaving the dream of a woman with long dark hair. She&#x2019;d been telling him something. Something important, something he was not supposed to forget.<br><br>He turned over in bed. He was alone, Sara&#x2019;s side of the bed cold. He sat up, listening carefully. Voices, soft giggles across the hall, from behind Gertie&#x2019;s bedroom door.<br><br>Had Sara spent the whole night in with Gertie again? Surely it couldn&#x2019;t be good for the girl, to smother her like that. Sometimes he worried that Sara&#x2019;s attachment to Gertie simply wasn&#x2019;t . . . healthy. Just last week, Sara had kept Gertie home from school for three straight days, and for those three days Sara doted on her--plaiting her hair, making her a new dress, baking her cookies, playing hide-and-seek. Sara&#x2019;s niece, Amelia, offered to take Gertie for the weekend, and Sara had made excuses--she gets homesick so easily, she&#x2019;s so frail--but Martin understood that it was Sara who could not bear to be without Gertie. Sara never seemed whole unless Gertie was by her side.<br><br>He pushed the worried thoughts away. Better to focus on the problems he understood and could do something about.<br><br>The house was cold, the fire out.<br><br>He peeled back the covers, threw his legs over the side of the bed, and pulled on his pants. His bad foot hung there like a hoof till he shoved it into the special boot fashioned for him by the cobbler in Montpelier. The soles were worn through, and he&#x2019;d stuffed the bottoms of both boots with dry grass and cattail fluff, all layered over scraps of leather, in a futile attempt to keep the dampness out. There was no money for new custom-made boots now.<br><br>Blight had ruined most of last fall&#x2019;s potato crop, and they relied on the money they got from selling the potatoes to the starch factory to get through the winter. It was only January, and the root cellar was nearly bare: a few spongy potatoes and carrots, some Hubbard squash, half a dozen jars of string beans and tomatoes Sara had put up last summer, a little salt pork from the hog they&#x2019;d butchered in November (they&#x2019;d traded most of the meat for dry goods at the general store). Martin would have to get a deer soon if they were going to have enough to eat. Sara had a talent for stretching what little food they had, for making milk gravy and biscuits with a bit of salt pork into a meal, but she couldn&#x2019;t create something from nothing.</p><h2>City Primeval: High Noon in Detroit</h2><p><p>&#x201c;As gritty and hard-driving a thriller as you&#x2019;ll find....The action never stops, the language sings and stings.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014;<em>Washington Post</em></p><p>The <em>City Primeval</em> in Elmore Leonard&#x2019;s relentlessly gripping classic noir is Detroit, the author&#x2019;s much-maligned hometown and the setting for many of the Grand Master&#x2019;s acclaimed crime novels.

Solow was ``responsible for the sale, development and production'' of the series; Justman served as Star Trek's co- producer. Together, they offer a chatty encyclopedia chronicling nearly every aspect of how the show was made. Fans of celebrity gossip will find some interesting (although generally familiar) material. For instance, the book explores, as it must, the brilliant yet flawed character of Star Trek's creator, Gene Roddenberry, and the competition between series stars William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy. But the bulk of this volume concerns the technological and commercial aspects of producing the show. Justman and Solow recount in fervent detail how the lighting, special effects, music, costumes, scripts, and sets of the series were created. Desilu Studios, Star Trek's home, was not a wealthy operation, and the show's first season was an especially harried one. Scenes often had to be reshot because the studio's ancient arc lights popped and squealed. Only a few sets for scenes on alien planets existed; the same props were ingeniously altered for each new show. We learn, as well, about the studio personnel, about the corporate rivalries and in-fighting that typified television production in general and Desilu Studios in particular. (The anecdotes about Lucille Ball are wonderful, as are Solow and Justman's descriptions of the manic day-to-day business of producing a series.) To their credit, the authors are not mean- spirited, rarely pompous, and seldom self-righteous. Unfortunately, the narrative is listless and without a distinctive personality. The bland prose coupled with almost numbing detail make it slow going. Still, despite its flaws, Star Trek completists and fans certainly will want to read this book.

The brown Ford Taurus sedan rocked its way down a rutted gravel road, twin plumes of dust corkscrewing into the hot August air. The blindfold was a precaution in case he failed, which Rapp had no intention of doing. He stared out the window at the thick wall of pines that bracketed the lane. Even with the bright sun he could see no more than thirty feet into the dark maze of trees and underbrush. As a child he&#x2019;d always found the woods to be an inviting place, but on this particular afternoon it had a decidedly more ominous feel.<br> <br>A foreboding premonition hijacked his thoughts and sent his mind careening into a place that he did not want to go. At least not this afternoon. Still, a frown creased his brow as Rapp wondered how many men had died in this particular forest, and he wasn&#x2019;t thinking of the men who had fought in the Civil War all those years earlier. No, he thought, trying to be completely honest with himself. Death was too open-ended a word for it. It left the possibility that some accident had befallen the person, and that was a convenient way to skirt the seriousness of what he was getting himself into. Executed was a far more accurate word. The men he was thinking of had been marched into these very woods, shot in the back of the head, and dumped into freshly dug holes never to be heard from again. That was the world that Rapp was about to enter, and he was utterly and completely at peace with his decision.<br> <br>Still, a sliver of doubt sliced through the curtains of his mind and caused a flash of hesitation. Rapp wrestled with it for a moment, and then stuffed it back into the deepest recesses of his brain. Now was not the time for second thoughts. He&#x2019;d been over this, around it, and under it. He&#x2019;d studied it from every conceivable angle since the day the mysterious woman had walked into his life. In a strange way, he knew where it was all headed from almost the first moment she&#x2019;d looked at him with those discerning, penetrating eyes.<br> <br>He had been waiting for someone to show up, though Rapp had never told her that. Or that the only way he could cope with the pain of losing the love of his life was to plot his revenge. That every single night before he went to sleep he thought of the network of faceless men who had plotted to bring down Pan Am Flight 103, that he saw himself on this very journey, headed to a remote place not dissimilar from the woods he now found himself in. It was all logical to him. Enemies needed to be killed, and Rapp was more than willing to become the person who would do that killing. He knew what was about to happen. He was to be trained, honed and forged into an ultimate precision weapon, and then he would begin to hunt them down. Every last one of the faceless men who had conspired to kill all those innocent civilians on that cold December night.<br> <br>The car began to slow and Rapp looked up to see a rusted cattle gate with a heavy chain and padlock. His dark brow furrowed with suspicion.<br> <br>The woman driving the vehicle glanced sideways at him and said, &#x201c;You were expecting something a little more high-tech perhaps.&#x201d;<br> <br>Rapp nodded silently.<br> <br>Irene Kennedy put the car in park and said, &#x201c;Appearances can be very deceiving.&#x201d; She opened her door and stepped from the vehicle. As she walked to the gate she listened. A moment later she heard the click of the passenger door, and she smiled. Without an ounce of training he had made the right decision. From their very first meeting it was apparent he was different. She had audited every detail of his life and watched him from afar for several months. Kennedy was exceedingly good at her job. She was methodical, organized, and patient. She also had a photographic memory.<br> <br>Kennedy had grown up in the business. Her father had worked for the State Department, and the vast majority of her education had taken place overseas in countries where an American was not always welcome. Vigilance was a part of her daily routine from the age of five. While other parents worried about their kids&#x2019; wandering out into the street and getting hit by a car, Kennedy&#x2019;s parents worried about her finding a bomb under their car. It was drilled into her to always be aware of her surroundings.<br> <br>When Kennedy finally introduced herself to Rapp, he studied her for a long second and then asked why she had been following him. At the time Rapp was only twenty-two, with no formal training. If Kennedy had a weakness it was with improvisation. She liked things plotted out well in advance, and being so thorough, she had gone in assuming the novice would have no idea that she had been running surveillance on him. She had recruited dozens of people and this was a first. Kennedy was caught off guard to the point of stammering for an answer. The recruit was supposed to be the one struggling to understand what was going on. Rapp&#x2019;s recognizing her was not part of the script.<br> <br>Later, in her motel room outside Syracuse, she retraced her every move over the past eight months and tried to figure out where she had slipped. After three hours and seventeen pages of notes, she still couldn&#x2019;t pinpoint her mistake. With frustration, and grudging admiration, she had concluded that Rapp had extremely acute situational awareness. She moved his file to the top of her stack and made a bold decision. Rather than use the normal people, she contacted a firm run by some retired spooks. They were old friends of her father&#x2019;s, who specialized in handling jobs without creating a paper trail. She asked them to take an objective look at Rapp, just in case she had missed something. Two weeks later they came back with a summary that sent chills up Kennedy&#x2019;s spine.<br> <br>Kennedy took that report straight to her boss, Thomas Stansfield. Midway through reading the file he suspected what she was up to. When he finished, he slowly closed the two-inch-thick biography of the young Mitch Rapp and made her plead her case. She was concise and to the point, but still Stansfield pointed out the potential pitfalls and obvious dangers of leapfrogging the initial phase of training. She countered perfectly. The game was changing. He had said it himself many times. They could not sit back and play defense, and in this ever more interconnected world they needed a weapon more surgical than any guided bomb or cruise missile. Having spent many years in the field himself, Stansfield also knew this person would have to be uniquely autonomous. Someone who conveniently had no official record.<br> <br>Kennedy ticked off eight additional reasons why she felt this young man was the perfect candidate. Her logic was sound, but beyond that there was the simple fact that they had to begin somewhere. By Stansfield&#x2019;s reckoning this was an endeavor they should have started a good five years earlier, so it was with a heavy sigh and a leap of faith that he decided to proceed. He told Kennedy to forgo the normal training and take him to the only man they knew who was crazy enough to try to mold a green recruit into what they needed. If Rapp could survive six months of schooling at the hands of Stan Hurley, he might indeed be the weapon they were looking for. Before she left, Stansfield told her to eliminate any connection: Every last file, surveillance photo, and recording that could ever tie them to Rapp was to be destroyed.<br> <br>Kennedy pulled the car through the gate and asked Rapp to close and lock it behind them. Rapp did as he was asked and then got back in the car. One hundred yards later Kennedy slowed the vehicle to a crawl and maneuvered diagonally in an effort to avoid a large pothole.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why no security on the perimeter?&#x201d; Rapp asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;The high-tech systems . . . more often than not . . . they draw too much unwanted attention. They also give a lot of false alarms, which in turn requires a lot of manpower. That&#x2019;s not what this place is about.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What about dogs?&#x201d; Rapp asked.<br> <br>She liked the way he was thinking. As if on cue, two hounds came galloping around the bend. The dogs charged straight at the vehicle. Kennedy stopped and waited for them to get out of her way. A moment later, after baring their teeth, they turned and bolted back in the direction they&#x2019;d just come from.<br> <br>Kennedy took her foot off the brake and proceeded up the lane. &#x201c;This man,&#x201d; Kennedy said. &#x201c;The one who will be training you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The crazy little guy who is going to try to kill me,&#x201d; Rapp said without smiling.<br> <br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t say he was going to try to kill you . . . I said he is going to try to make you think he&#x2019;s trying to kill you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Very comforting,&#x201d; Rapp said sarcastically. &#x201c;Why do you keep bringing him up?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I want you to be prepared.&#x201d;<br> <br>Rapp thought about that for a moment and said, &#x201c;I am, or at least as prepared as you can be for something like this.&#x201d;<br> <br>She considered that for a moment. &#x201c;The physical part is assumed. We know you&#x2019;re in good shape, and that&#x2019;s important, but I want you to know that you will be pushed in ways you never imagined. It&#x2019;s a game. One that&#x2019;s designed to make you quit. Your greatest asset will be mental discipline, not physical strength.&#x201d;<br> <br>Rapp disagreed with her but kept his mouth shut and his face a mask of neutrality. To be the best required equal doses of both. He knew the game. He&#x2019;d been through plenty of grueling football and lacrosse practices in the humid August heat of Virginia, and back then it was only a simple desire to play that kept him going. Now his motivation to succeed was much deeper. Far more personal.<br> <br>&#x201c;Just try to remember... none of it is personal,&#x201d; Kennedy said.<br> <br>Rapp smiled inwardly. That&#x2019;s where you&#x2019;re wrong, he thought. It&#x2019;s all personal. When he responded, however, he was compliant. &#x201c;I know,&#x201d; Rapp said in an easy tone. &#x201c;What about these other guys?&#x201d; If there was one thing that made him a little nervous it was this. The other recruits had been down here for two days. Rapp didn&#x2019;t like getting a late start. They would have already begun the bonding process and were likely to resent his showing up late. He didn&#x2019;t understand the delay, but she wasn&#x2019;t exactly forthright with information.<br> <br>&#x201c;There are six of them.&#x201d; Kennedy scrolled through the photos in her mind&#x2019;s eye. She had read their jackets. They all had military experience and shared, at least on paper, many of Rapp&#x2019;s qualities. They were all dark-featured, athletic, capable of violence, or at least not afraid of it, and they had all to one degree or another passed the extensive psychological exams. They had all showed a facility for foreign languages. In terms of a sense of right and wrong, they all hovered near that critical six o&#x2019;clock position on the mental health pie chart. That thin line that separated law enforcement officers from career criminals.<br> <br>Around the next bend the landscape opened up before them. A freshly mowed lawn roughly the size of a football field ran along both sides of the lane all the way to a white barn and two-story house with a wraparound porch. This was not what Rapp had expected. The place looked like a rural postcard complete with a set of rocking chairs on the big white porch.<br> <br>A man appeared from inside the house. He was holding a cup of coffee in one hand and a cigarette in the other. Rapp watched him move across the porch. The man swiveled his head to the left and then right in a casual manner. Most people would have missed it, but Rapp&#x2019;s senses had been opened to the reality that the world was divided between those who were part of the herd and those who liked to hunt. The man was checking his flanks. He stopped at the top of the porch steps and looked down at them from behind a pair of aviator sunglasses. Rapp smiled ever so slightly at the realization that this was the man who was going to try to break him. It was a challenge he had been looking forward to for some time.</p><h2>Best of Rosemary Sutcliff:Warrior Scarlet,Mark of the Horse Lord and Knight&#39;s Fee</h2><p>Rosemary Sutcliff CBE (14 December 1920 - 23 July 1992) was a British novelist best known for children&#39;s books, especially historical fiction and retellings of myths and legends. Although she was primarily a children&#39;s author, the quality and depth of her writing also appeals to adults. In a 1986 interview she said, &#34;I would claim that my books are for children of all ages, from nine to ninety.&#34; Sutcliff lived for many years in Walberton near Arundel, Sussex. In 1975, she was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for services to children&#39;s literature, and was promoted to be a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1992. The Mark of the Horse Lord won the inaugural Phoenix Award in 1985, named by the Children&#39;s Literature Association the best English-language children&#39;s book that did not a major award when it was originally published twenty years earlier. She wrote incessantly throughout her life and was still writing on the morning of her death in 1992. Sutcliff never married and had no children.</p><p></p><h2>Junior Astronomy Notebooking Journal for Exploring Creation with Astronomy</h2><p>Complementing <i>Exploring Creation with Astronomy</i>, the Astronomy Notebooking Journal will provide everything your students need to complete their studies in astronomy.

It is about outrunning the devil and achieving the impossible faith, diligence, and the desire to give back. It is the American dream come true and a stark reminder that saving one can help to save thousands more.</p><p>Lopez Lomong chronicles his inspiring ascent from a barefoot lost boy of the Sudanese Civil War to a Nike sponsored athlete on the US Olympic Team.

She once said there were two simple rules that she followed absolutely: to tell the truth, and not do anything she didn't want to do. Such integrity both distinguishes and defines <i>If You Want to Write</i>, her bestselling classic that first appeared in the late 1930s and has inspired thousands to find their own creative center. As Carl Sandburg once remarked, Ueland's primer is "the best book ever written on how to write."<br></p><p>This book so speaks to the contemporary writer that it is nearly impossible to believe that it was originally published in 1938. In <i>If You Want to Write</i>, Brenda Ueland sets forth not just a philosophy about how to write or how to create, but also about how to live. Beginning writers will certainly be encouraged by Ueland's words, but even the most experienced have much to glean from Ueland's simple wisdom. "Everybody," writes Ueland in the opening chapter, "is talented, original, and has something important to say." Finding that something important involves embracing creative idleness ("the imagination needs moodling--long, inefficient, happy idling, dawdling and puttering"), freeing "what we <i>really</i> think, from what we think we ought to think," and "thumb[ing] your nose at all know-it-alls, jeerers, critics, doubters." One must think, she says, "of telling a story, not of writing it." And when revising one's writing, she advises, "do not try to think of better <i>words</i>, more gripping words.... It is not yet deeply enough imagined." Finally, "whenever you find yourself writing a single word or phrase or page dutifully and with boredom, then leave it out.... If what you write bores you, it will bore other people." And just because <i>If You Want to Write</i> is passionate, sincere, and even spiritual, do not think it is not also witty. One footnote bluntly declaims, "No doubt my terms would horrify a psychologist but I do not care at all." Elsewhere Ueland titles a chapter "Why Women Who Do Too Much Housework Should Neglect It for Their Writing." Amen, sister!In her 93 remarkable years, Brenda Ueland published six million words. She said she had two rules she followed absolutely: to tell the truth, and not to do anything she didn&#39;t want to do. Her integrity shines throughout If You Want to Write, her best-selling classic on the process of writing that has already inspired thousands to find their own creative center. Carl Sandburg called this book &#34;The best book ever written about how to write&#34;. Yet Ueland reminds us that &#34;Whenever I say &#39;writing&#39; in this book, I also mean anything that you love and want to do or to make&#34;. Ueland&#39;s writing and her teaching are made compelling by her feisty spirit of independence and joy.</p><h2>The Diamond in Your Pocket: Discovering Your True Radiance</h2><p>With The Diamond in Your Pocket, Gangaji describes our never-ending search to find fulfillment, which, paradoxically, already exists if we will only stop long enough to discover its true source.</p><p>Gangaji is an American &#x2013; born teacher and author who has traveled the globe since 1990, speaking with spiritual seekers from all walks of life. Her message is powerful in its clarity and simplicity: True peace and lasting fulfillment are not only our birthright, they are the essential nature of our being.The Last Place You Thought To Look <p>There is a story my teacher liked to tell about a consummate diamond thief who sought to steal only the most exquisite of gems. This thief would hang around the diamond district to see who was purchasing a gem, so that later he could pick their pocket. </p><p>One day he saw a well-known diamond merchant purchase the jewel he had been waiting for all his life. It was the most beautiful, the most pristine, the purest of diamonds. He was very excited, and so he followed the diamond merchant as he boarded the train, getting into the same compartment. He spent a three-day journey trying to pick the merchant's pocket and obtain the diamoond. When the end of the journey came and he hadn't found the gem, he was very frustrated. He was an accomplished thief, and although he had emplyed all his skills, he still was not able to steal this rare and precious jewel. </p><p>When the diamond merchant got off the train, the pickpocket followed him once again. Finally, he just couldn't stand it any more, and he walked up to the merchant and said, "Sir, I am a renowned diamond thief. I saw you purchase that beautiful diamond, so I followed you onto the train. Though I used all the skills of my art, which have been perfected over many years, I was not able to find the gem. I must know your secret. Tell me, please, how did you hide it from me? </p><p>The diamond merchant replied, "Well, I saw you watching me in the diamond district, and I suspected you were a pickpocket. So I hid the diamond where I thought you would be least likely to look for it - in your own pocket!" He then reached into the thief's pocket and pulled out the diamond. </p><p>The treasure that I invite you to receive, that I will continually be pointing to throughout this book, is in your pocket right now, the pocket of your heart. The heart that I speak of is even closer to you than your emotional heart. It is the heart that is the core of your being. Ant step to go somewhere to find it it implies that it is not already right here where you are. Simply see the radiant bounty of your true nature, accept that bounty, and then you will share that bounty quite naturally.</p></p><h2>The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</h2><p>Sherlock Holmes Collection.</p><p>Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859 - 1930) Conan Doyle is perhaps best known for giving the literary world Sherlock Holmes, but he was also a doctor, journalist and public figure. Arthur Conan Doyle was born on 22 May 1859 in Edinburgh into a rich Irish family. He trained as a doctor at Edinburgh University, and then worked as a surgeon on a whaling boat, and as a doctor on a ship travelling between England and Africa. Afterwards he settled with his family in Portsmouth, working in medicine and at the same time writing. Sherlock Holmes first appeared in 'A Study of Scarlet', published in 1887. This success led Conan Doyle to write more stories involving Holmes and Watson but, in 1893, Conan Doyle killed off Holmes, wanting to develop his serious writing. The public was not happy about the detective&#x2019;s demise and Conan Doyle was forced to resurrect Holmes. Conan Doyle also wrote non-fiction, and he was knighted for publishing a pamphlet justifying Britain's involvement in the Boer War. He also wrote histories of the Boer War and World War One. Conan Doyle twice attempted to enter parliament, but was not successful. Conan Doyle died of a heart attack on 7 July 1930.</p><h2>The Man Who Named the Clouds</h2><p>In 1782, when Luke Howard was ten, he began keeping a weather journal to describe what he saw in the sky--he especially loved to watch the clouds. As an adult, Luke wanted to classify clouds, though many others had failed at this.</p><p>Julie Hannah is an Albert Whitman author.Gr. 3-5. Born in England in 1772, Luke Howard began keeping a weather journal when he was 10 years old. He maintained an interest in weather and clouds all his life, though he supported himself and his family as a chemist. In 1802, he proposed a system of classifying clouds into seven types, basing their names on the Latin words <i>cirrus</i>, <i>cumulus</i>, and <i>stratus</i>. His system was adopted and, in adapted form, is still used today. This colorful book balances biographical and historical information with basic weather science, presented in the form of a modern child's monthly weather journal. The interspersed journal pages present information about weather, a simple project, and a few riddles. Artwork includes reproductions of a portrait of Howard and his own paintings of clouds, Billin-Frye's winsome illustrations, and photos of the 10 types of clouds recognized today. An attractive combination of biographical narrative and weather science. Bibliography appended. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Are you asleep?&#x201d;<br>I kept my eyes closed while I pondered my answer. If I said &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; would my husband, Michael, understand that I was only expressing how much my sleep-deprived body craved a few minutes of oblivion?<br>No, I&#x2019;d probably just sound cranky. I felt cranky. Most women occasionally do when they&#x2019;re eight-and-a-half months pregnant, especially with twins. Any woman who says otherwise has obviously never been pregnant.<br>&#x201c;Meg?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m thinking about it.&#x201d; I opened one eye and saw Michael&#x2019;s tall, lean frame silhouetted in the bedroom doorway. He was holding a small brown paper bag in one hand. &#x201c;If that bag contains chocolate, then I&#x2019;m definitely not asleep.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Chocolate chip cookies from Geraldine&#x2019;s,&#x201d; Michael said, shaking the bag enticingly.<br>&#x201c;Okay, I&#x2019;m awake,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not as if Heckle and Jeckle were going to let me get any sleep anyway.&#x201d;<br>I began the laborious process of hauling myself upright. Michael cleared some junk off the little folding table by my side of the bed, produced a plate from somewhere, poured half a dozen enormous soft chocolate chip cookies onto it, and placed a large glass of cold milk beside it. Then he pulled the curtains open, revealing that it was still fairly early in the morning, and a dreary gray winter morning at that.<br>&#x201c;At times like this, I&#x2019;m particularly glad I married you,&#x201d; I said, reaching for a cookie. &#x201c;So what&#x2019;s the reason for this bribe?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;There has to be a reason?&#x201d; He snagged a cookie for himself and pulled a chair up to the other side of the table.<br>&#x201c;As busy as you usually are in December grading exams and reading term papers and all that other end-of-semester stuff faculty have to do at the college, you still went all the way to Geraldine&#x2019;s for cookies?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Okay, there&#x2019;s a reason.&#x201d; He paused, then frowned as if puzzled. I took a big bite of cookie and washed it down with a swig of milk, to brace myself. Michael was rarely at a loss for words, so what ever he wanted to say must be momentous.<br>&#x201c;Is it okay if we have another house guest?&#x201d; he finally asked. He sounded so anxious that I looked up in surprise.<br>&#x201c;Is that all?&#x201d; I said through a mouthful of cookie. His face relaxed into something more like its usual calm good humor. &#x201c;Michael, I haven&#x2019;t the slightest idea how many house guests we have already. There&#x2019;s Rob&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Your brother&#x2019;s not exactly a house guest,&#x201d; Michael put in. &#x201c;After two years, I think he qualifies as a resident.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And Cousin Rose Noire&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Also more like a resident, unless you&#x2019;ve changed your mind about accepting her offer to stay on and help us through that difficult adjustment to having the twins around.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Right now, I have no objection if she stays on long enough to help us through the difficult adjustment to sending them off to college.&#x201d; I reached for a second cookie. &#x201c;But there&#x2019;s still my grandfather, and of course all those displaced drama department students filling up the spare rooms and camping out in the living room. How many of them do we have, anyway?&#x201d;<br>He frowned again.<br>&#x201c;Maybe a dozen?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Or a dozen and a half?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Seems like more,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;There are at least a dozen sleeping in the living room.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Two dozen, then,&#x201d; he said. Still probably a conservative estimate. &#x201c;More or less. And before you ask, I have no idea how much longer they&#x2019;ll be here. Last time I heard, some critical piece of equipment down at the college heating plant was still in a million pieces on the floor, and the dean of facilities was running around with a harried look on his face and a bottle of Tums in his pocket.&#x201d;<br>I heard a series of thuds and thumps in the hallway. A month ago I&#x2019;d have gone running to see what was happening, or at least sent Michael to check. Our weeks of living with students underfoot had made us blas� about such noises.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d think a big place like Caerphilly College could figure out how to get a boiler repaired,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s been&#x2014;what, three weeks now?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Three weeks tomorrow.&#x201d; Michael took another cookie. &#x201c;Not that I&#x2019;m counting or anything. Meanwhile, the whole campus is still without heat. And from the temperatures the weatherman is predicting next week, you&#x2019;d think we lived in Antarctica instead of Virginia.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Which means the students stay for the foreseeable future,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;And since the Caerphilly Inn is also full to overflowing with displaced students, and Grandfather can&#x2019;t get the suite he usually stays in when he comes to town, we&#x2019;re stuck with him, too. With all that going on, what&#x2019;s one more person?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a trouper,&#x201d; Michael said, with a smile that could have convinced me to invite the entire freshman class to move in.<br>I heard the crash of something breaking downstairs in the hall. I winced out of habit, even though I knew nearly everything of ours that the students could possibly have broken had long ago been locked up in the basement or the attic. By the time I got downstairs, the student would have picked up the broken object, what ever it was, and Rose Noire would probably have washed, waxed, and polished the patch of floor on which it had fallen.<br>&#x201c;So who&#x2019;s our newest house guest?&#x201d; I asked.<br>&#x201c;Remember Ramon Soto?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;One of my grad students?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The one who&#x2019;s been holding his play rehearsals in our library? Yes. I thought he was already living here.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He is. As is most of his cast. Makes it convenient. Anyway, the play&#x2019;s part of his dissertation project. He&#x2019;s doing it on Ignacio Mendoza, the Spanish playwright.&#x201d;<br>Was Mendoza someone famous? The Spanish equivalent of Shakespeare, or Shaw, or at least Neil Simon? The name didn&#x2019;t sound familiar, but one side effect of pregnancy, at least for me, was that my hormone-enriched brain temporarily jettisoned every single bit of information it didn&#x2019;t think was useful in my present situation. At least I hoped it was temporary.<br>&#x201c;Ignacio Mendoza?&#x201d; I said aloud. &#x201c;Is that a name I should recognize?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not unless you&#x2019;re a fan of obscure mid-twentieth-century Spanish playwrights,&#x201d; Michael said. He finished his cookie and moved to sit on the foot of the bed. &#x201c;For Ramon&#x2019;s dissertation project, in addition to the critical study on Mendoza, he&#x2019;s done a new translation of one of Mendoza&#x2019;s plays and is directing it. And one thing he discovered while doing his research is that, to everyone&#x2019;s amazement, Mendoza is still alive.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Why amazement?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Because most people thought Generalissimo Franco had Mendoza shot back in the fifties.&#x201d; He picked up my right foot and began massaging it.<br>I closed my eyes, the better to enjoy the foot rub. Carrying around an extra fifty or more pounds does a number on your arches.<br>&#x201c;Apparently he just went to ground in Catalonia and kept a low profile for the last sixty years,&#x201d; Michael added.<br>&#x201c;Sixty years?&#x201d; I echoed. &#x201c;How old is he, anyway?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Nearly ninety. Which is why Ramon thought it was pretty safe to invite him to come to the opening night of the play. He just assumed the old guy would be flattered and send polite regrets. No one ever expected Mendoza to accept&#x2014;and at the last possible moment. We&#x2019;ve managed to scrape up some money from the department to pay for his airfare, but even if we had enough to cover a hotel stay&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Every single hotel room in town is full of refugee students,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Plus every spare room in just about every private house. I&#x2019;d have thought we were pretty full ourselves.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The students are going to rearrange themselves to free up a room,&#x201d; Michael said.<br>Aha. That probably explained the earlier thumps and thuds, along with the dragging noises I could hear out in the hall. Michael switched to my left foot.<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re also going to swap a few of our drama students who aren&#x2019;t in the play for a few more Spanish-speaking students,&#x201d; he went on. &#x201c;That way there will always be someone around to translate for Se�or Mendoza. And the students will chauffeur him around and cook for him or take him out to eat&#x2014;in fact, your grandfather&#x2019;s promised to help as well. And if he&#x2019;s in his eighties, how much trouble can Se�or Mendoza be?&#x201d;<br>I thought of pointing out that even though my grandfather was over ninety, he regularly stirred up quite a lot of trouble. Of course, trouble was a way of life for Dr. Montgomery Blake, world famous zoologist, gadfly environmentalist, and animal-welfare activist. Why was Grandfather offering to help entertain our guest, anyway? Did he consider the elderly playwright a kind of endangered species?<br>But I had to admit, Michael had done everything possible to make sure our potential house guest wouldn&#x2019;t cause me any work or stress.<br>&#x201c;So it&#x2019;s really all right if we host Se�or Mendoza?&#x201d; he asked.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s fine. The more the merrier. Wait a minute&#x2014;the play opens Friday and it&#x2019;s already Wednesday. How soon is he arriving?&#x201d;<br>Michael glanced at his watch.<br>&#x201c;In about half an hour.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Excerpted from Stork Raving Mad by Donna Andrews.<br>Copyright&nbsp; 2010 by Donna Andrews.<br>Published in 2010 by Minotaur Books.<br>All rights reserved.
